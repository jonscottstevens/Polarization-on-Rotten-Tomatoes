"14",0.5,"  A sickening gut punch of a movie.The visuals and music were gorgeous but thats where the good stuff ends. This was a bad movie and absolutely awful star wars movie. The story made no sense, existing lore and continuity was completely disregarded, Luke is utterly unrecognisable from his original beloved character, dialogue is terrible and plot holes abound.This film as killed the remaining love I had for the start wars universe","The Last Jedi",14,4.1,3.6
"15",0.5,"  Plot holes, bad side story (Finn, Rose), political messages and a lack of respect of the older characters. It also takes too much freedom with how the force works, it's basically a Deus ex machina at this point. Star Wars is dead.","The Last Jedi",15,4.1,3.6

"18",1,"  Such great characters: Rey, Finn, Poe, Luke, Leia, Phasma, Snoke... All wasted. Didn't really fit the overall story or character developments set up over the last seven movies.","The Last Jedi",18,4.1,3.1
"19",2,"  How many consistency mistakes can you make? Probably cuased by focus on historic stars, story lines and xsucce sfators which do not work any more, at least not for me. So strange that this clumsy movie with overacting actors gets such high scores here.","The Last Jedi",19,4.1,2.1
"20",5,"  The Last Jedi was a great movie, with just 2 decisions that bugged me. 1. The admiral Holdo-Poe conflict was silly and inconsequential, and could have been avoided if she wasn't written in a way to specifically cause anger and conflict.2. Finn's decision to sacrifice himself should have been followed through. They let down a big character changing monent for Finn. Rose's quote in this scene was laughably stupid and cringeworthy.Besides those two points, it is a well directed, beautifully shot movie that was enjoyable to watch and had great action scenes. I'd watch it again, and I can't wait for Episode 9.My honest review of this movie would be 4 stars out of 5, but I want the 5 star review to offset the ridiculous over-analyzing no lifes hating on this movie.","The Last Jedi",20,4.1,-0.9
"21",1,"  Luke Skywalker's character was dissed so bad in this film . I can honestly say they made all the characters unlikable .. Director Rian and JJ Abrams .. effed this series royally","The Last Jedi",21,4.1,3.1
"22",0.5,"  If you were to able to reverse the roles gender wise the women would not have tolerated being the losers that depend on the men to make everything right. So the movie I think failed big time in the writing and characterization of the good guys.","The Last Jedi",22,4.1,3.6
"23",2,"  There were so many problems with this movie from top to bottom. In reading the positive reviews, I'm not sure we were watching the same movies. I watched this at home, which may have missed out on the experience. Poor character development, nonsensical plot, mediocre CGI (especially the stills), and none of the choreography and music that Star Wars has been known to do well.","The Last Jedi",23,4.1,2.1
"24",2,"  Visually amazing in many ways but this has to be the worst attempt at telling a Star Wars story I've ever seenThis is coming from a die hard Star Wars fan who grew up with the movies, video games, books, comics, toys, etc. The whole movie takes place over a span of like 10 hours and does nothing to advance the story. They basically took all the possibilities that TFA set up and threw them out the window. Like is now a coward and useless, Rey is the exact same as before, Kylo is always about to cry, Hux is the least intemidating villian ever, we never find out anything at all about smoke and OH! He's dead now. The entire adventure of Finn and Rose is pointless and just takes away from what's going on with the story. Rose is a completely pointless character who adds nothing. LUKE DIES FOR NO REASON. Leia flies through space. Chewie does nothing. Why doesn't Admeral Halsey just tell Poe or anyone that they aren't all going to die so they don't get involved with the stupid side quest that ends in resistance fighters getting blown up. BB-9E got hyped up and does nothing in the movie. The whole force image of luke that fights kylo is dumb and they both stand really weird the whole time. Rose saves Finn in the speeders by hitting him from directly sideways after she had already turned back and Finn was like 1,000 yards farther along than her. Yoda is great. Ports are great. Nein Nub survives so that's cool. Akbar is dead :(. We still don't really know about Rey's parents or how luke's lightsaber was found. How did the top just rip off of the AT-ST that BB-8 rode on? Soooo what was the point of this movie?","The Last Jedi",24,4.1,2.1
"25",0.5,"  After years of waiting for luke to return he's a depressed jedi who doesn't want to be found... even after leaving a map behind to find him.","The Last Jedi",25,4.1,3.6
"26",1,"  Really some people thinks this is a Star Wars movie?The original Story is about the Skywalkers, if you want to Watch a movie about pass the torch to a new generation, this is your chance but if you love the original Star Wars Characters avoid this mess","The Last Jedi",26,4.1,3.1
"27",1.5,"  Very disappointed, I gave it another shot on Blue Ray, it's just as bad, this time even worse because of the negative feelings I already had for this movie. Tried to like it but couldn't, there's no way I'm watching Solo, a pathetic script it's like they re wrote the freaking original with a different spin, but this time it sucks! Killing off one fo the most iconic character in Star Wars franchise. Idiots!","The Last Jedi",27,4.1,2.6
"28",4.5,"  I loved how the film embraces the idea of balance between the light and the dark. It makes this the most interesting Star Wars film yet.","The Last Jedi",28,4.1,-0.4
"29",0.5,"  The problem is the makers of this film where interested more in political statements then making a film worthy of the franchise. Keep ANY politics out of it!","The Last Jedi",29,4.1,3.6
"30",2,"  I can't believe they were allowed to via away from the original stotyboard, Screwing with the continuity, and leaving no cliffhanger making the last in the trilogy a movie I am no longer interested in. Poorly written, bad choice of director with a self-massaged ego.","The Last Jedi",30,4.1,2.1
"31",1,"  Terrible what have you done ,this is unforgivable","The Last Jedi",31,4.1,3.1
"32",0.5,"  Can I give this ZERO stars? This was the worst StarWars ever. You kill the ONLY two interesting characters in this movie & you try to FORCE us to be invested in Mary Sue ...I mean Rey, when she is basically Supergirl. This movie wasn't StarWars I don't know what it was. SJW Awakens?","The Last Jedi",32,4.1,3.6
"33",4.5,"  I loved this movie. I am a long time Star Wars fan who started with episode IV. This is not my favorite Star Wars film to date, but it was defiantly enjoyable to watch.","The Last Jedi",33,4.1,-0.4
"34",1,"  IT WAS HORRIBLE....screw rian johnson, kathlene kennedy, and disney for screwing this up...you ruined my childhood with this garbage.","The Last Jedi",34,4.1,3.1
"35",0.5,"  Not only the worst star wars by far but one of the worst movies ever made.","The Last Jedi",35,4.1,3.6
"36",0.5,"  If I could give this zero stars, I would. This isn't just a bad star wars movie, it's one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Serious plot holes, nonsensical meandering story, and the character development (or lack of) is just awful. To make things worse, the filmmakers appear to be pushing political messages throughout the feature. Not something most people want rammed down their throats at the best of times. Certainly not from a franchise loved by generations of people, from all walks of life, who just want what they have come to expect from a star wars movie.This is not star wars. It may have spaceships, blasters and lightsabers, but that's about it. R.I.P. STAR WARS......","The Last Jedi",36,4.1,3.6
"37",0.5,"  I desperately wanted to like this movie, I really did. I loved The Force Awakens despite its lack of originality. I thought it was a fun movie that gave just the right amount of respect to the original cast while introducing us to an engaging cast of new characters. I had high hopes for the future of the franchise until I saw this flaming bag of dog doo. After leaving the theater in shock at the total disrespect of the characters and the source material, I took a step back and decided that maybe my initial reaction was too strong. Maybe I needed to give it a second chance and accept that sometimes change is necessary to advance the overall narrative of a story. Unfortunately, after a second viewing my aversion to this movie has only deepened. It is painfully obvious to me that the powers that be who created this disaster of a movie sacrificed quality story telling to advance a political agenda(s). They almost smash you in the face with it its so obvious to me now. What a water opportunity, thanks for nothing Rian Johnson.","The Last Jedi",37,4.1,3.6
"38",1,"  Gets 1 star for great visual effects. Other than that, it's by far the worst Star Wars film to date. The writing is atrocious and full of holes. The story goes absolutely nowhere. It's complete and utter ignorance of established Star Wars lore is insulting. A bad movie on it's own, but an even worse Star Wars movie. Avoid this movie like the plague.","The Last Jedi",38,4.1,3.1
"39",1,"  This film didn't respect the past instead they destroyed it too many jokes and no link to the new trilogy but the film is shot beautifully and it could of been better than this. expand the universe Disney make new threat for the new order and the rebels that will make it more interesting. ps mabe a fan of force awakens will like it more just too many missed opportunities.","The Last Jedi",39,4.1,3.1
"40",0.5,"  Disappointing in so many ways. It fails as a story. It fails as a Star Wars movie. It fails as a Science Fiction movie. It fails it's fan base. It fails to entertain. I watched this movie opening night and left with a great sense of disappointment. I went and watched it a second time just to be sure I wasn't missing somerhing. After the second viewing I went from disappointment to disgust. It is as if they gored a director/writer that hated Star Wars and and somehow conned his way into the franchise to destroy it from within. I will see the next instalment, Solo, but if they let me down there, I will resist seeing the final movie as a form of protest against Disney. Is Disney now the metaphorical Empire/First Order. Do we need to form a rebellion?","The Last Jedi",40,4.1,3.6
"41",1.5,"  Slow and predictable story line.","The Last Jedi",41,4.1,2.6

"43",0.5,"  Really wanted to like it, and watched it a second time. Fundamentally a horrible movie. Take the star wars name out of it, and all the emotion on both sides. It was an awful movie with wasted character dev, poor story, and completely unnecessary plot holes. Lazily written, and for all of the resources and legacy at their disposal, Disney should be ashamed.","The Last Jedi",43,4.1,3.6
"44",0.5,"  Garbage with nice explosions and battles.","The Last Jedi",44,4.1,3.6
"45",5,"  I loved everything about this movies the good parts, the ""bad"" parts, the ones that didn't make sense but I the thing I loved the most were the answers to the questions the last movie left us with like (SPOILERS): Rey being the balance to Kylo (Explaining her powers), Kylos origings and Luke throwing his ligth saber was hillarious","The Last Jedi",45,4.1,-0.9

"49",1,"  What a big disappointment!!!!","The Last Jedi",49,4.1,3.1
"50",1.5,"  It breaks my heart to say it because I've loved all Star Wars films since I was a child, but that changed with this movie. I don't know why critics assumed fans would like this film; I can only guess they're not savvy to the Star Wars fandom. I'm also not sure where they get the idea that the story telling is decent as it is easily some of the worst I have seen in a movie. This is a sequel allegedly but you could easily not watch the Force Awakens as it throws all of the established plot threads and character personalities out the window to do its own thing. Its own thing being gaping plot holes in the star wars lore, badly written characters and pacing that baffles common sense.Visually it is stunning. But cleaning a toilet doesn't change the fact it is still a toilet. It is watchable, but I cannot watch it without shaking my head in frustration. This was the film that needed to answer questions so we could be excited for the final instalment in this new trilogy. Instead it wastes time and gives answers that carry little weight. Somewhere between the stolen motifs of the original trilogy and thoughtless meandering, the film lost itself. It is upsetting to see such a beloved franchise placed in the hands of people who do not understand it, The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise is but a shadow when compared to the Tragedy of the Last Jedi and what it could have been.","The Last Jedi",50,4.1,2.6
"51",0.5,"  such a disappointing movie, flawed in almost every way possible. single handedly divided a unified fan base and destroyed a great franchise. star wars is dead.","The Last Jedi",51,4.1,3.6
"52",0.5,"  sin duda la peor película de star wars , los vacios argumentales que hay entre el episodio 7 y 8 son horrible toda las dudas que te genero el episodio 7 a que te las tiran por la cabeza---- quien son los padres de rey? nadie? entonces por que mierda le dieron tantas vuelas en el episodio 7 y por que se ven los padres de rey o quien sea abandonándola en el planeta ¿ quien es snoke ? a quien le importa si ya esta muerto ¿ que sera del grandioso luke skywalker? nada solo se volvió un ermitaño que intento matar a su sobrino por que vio maldad en el jajajajaja nada que ver con el luke de verdad que intento salvar a su padre del lado oscuro sabiendo todo lo malo de sus acciones y lo todas la gente que mato ... a si el guion de la pelicula es asco ose como 20 minutos de relleno en la parte del casino que al final no sirvió de una mierda .... en tema de los personaje nada bueno- finn literalmente un personaje de relleno y igual que rose- rey no avanza nada como personaje-poe tampoco y lo hacen parecer un estúpido- kaylo ren es el único que vi que avanzara como personaje y para mi fue el mejor de la peli ..... en fin toda la culpa de este desastre de peli tiene nombre rian johnson por no guiarse de los borradores de jj abrams para que no tuviéramos tenidos estos vacios argumentales y esta basura","The Last Jedi",52,4.1,3.6
"53",1,"  This movie doesn't just have plot holes. The entire movie IS a plot hole. As a Star Wars fan since I was maybe 3 years old it just makes me sick what they have done with this series. The problems really started with The Force Awakens, but while that movie had issues, this sequel takes a nose dive right into the ground. The four young main characters of the film are Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren. Each of these characters is effectively ruined by the end of the film. Rey, as the Force-user of this series, doesn't really need any training. In The Force Awakens she picks up a lightsaber for the first time and defeats Kylo Ren with it. This would be like Luke defeating Darth Vader in A New Hope. But anyway, we are told throughout The Force Awakens that Rey needs to find Luke who is missing. Why? To get trained, we assume. The entire first movie is a buildup to the cliffhanger scene at the end where Rey meets Luke, and then the film rolls to credits. Yet in The Last Jedi, Luke doesn't train Rey at all. She accomplishes nothing while she is on the island with Luke, except for the fact that she is able to connect with Kylo Ren through the Force, which is one of several Force-powers that we, as an audience, have never seen before. Poe is emasculated in this film. He's supposed to be the Han Solo of this series but he is told he is making bad decisions time and time again by the female leaders of the resistance. Finn might as well not have even been in the movie. He is treated right off the bat like a joke. After trying to heroically save Rey and nearly being cut in half at the end of The Force Awakens, we see him walking around half naked in a water balloon. Because why? I guess it was supposed to be funny. He then spends the rest of the movie running around with this new character Rose on a fool's errand, trying to find some device that will do something to help the Resistance ships escape the First Order because the First Order has some tracking device that blah blah blah blah. Its all a big plot device that doesn't make much sense and doesn't matter anyway by the end of the movie. Finn and Rose also spend time on a Casino planet saving a bunch of anime-horses from being abused while at the same time leaving a bunch of children in slavery. They could have saved the kids from slavery and left the horses but instead they went with saving the horses. Near the end of the movie, Finn has a chance to save the Resistance by destroying this big cannon that the First Order is going to use against the Resistance. He attempts a suicide run but is stopped suddenly by Rose. Because why? I have no idea. Her stopping his suicide run made no sense. Now the First Order is just going to kill them all, right? As far as she knows anyway. Also they're having this little love scene right in front of the First Order. Why the First Order didn't kill both Finn and Rose right there I have no idea. Kylo Ren, and really the entire First Order for that matter, are no longer threatening villains. Kylo was defeated by Rey (who had no training) in the first movie, so why should we as an audience feel threatened by him? Same goes for General Hux. In this opening scene of the movie, instead of having an impressive battle sequence, the director of this film opts to have a joke scene where Poe calls Hux and plays some kind of phone game with him, and Hux falls for it. This is supposed to be funny but its not. What it does is basically render Hux a non-entity. We no longer care about him or are threatened by him after this. Captain Phasma? Another wasted character. She shows up for 30 seconds and dies. They bring Admiral Ackbar in just to kill him off screen. If Admiral Ackbar had been the one to do the suicide run with the Resistance ship instead of Admiral Holdo, it would have mattered. We care about Ackbar. We don't care about Holdo. But they killed Ackbar off screen. The entire sequence with the First Order chasing the resistence fleet makes no sense. Why doesn't the First Order just hyperspace jump in front of the resistance fleet? Why don't they send starfighters to kill the Resistence fleet? Why does the Resistence just send everyone out on transports like Finn and Rose did? None of it makes any sense. Not sure why Leia was in this movie either. We see her using the Force for the first time to save herself from space. Here's two problems with that scene. One: she uses the Force to get back to the ship, but how does she get into the ship through the door without killing everyone inside it? Two: if Leia was so powerful with the Force, why doesn't SHE train Rey? Why does Rey have to go find Luke if she's already got a powerful Force-user right there who can train her? Not that Rey gets trained by Luke at all anyway. The saddest part of this whole movie is Luke. Luke is the hero of Star Wars. Luke risks everything in Return of the Jedi on the belief that he can save his father, Darth Vader, the second most evil guy in the universe, from the dark side, and he succeeds. Why would this hero then turn around and try to murder his own sister's son in his sleep just because he sensed a little dark side in him? Luke would never do that. Never. He also would not hide on an island while that same nephew murders Han Solo and blows up a planet with the Starkiller death star thing. The Luke of this movie is basically a coward. What this movie has accomplished is that it has essentially rendered the sequel trilogy null and void. There is no reason to continue with Episode 9. None of these characters matter anymore.","The Last Jedi",53,4.1,3.1

"71",0.5,"  Hated it. The way Luke dies, the way Snoke dies, and Star Wars dies the exact same way after this film. The film did suprise me here and there but not in a good way. You may have heard it all before but it is a remake of the origanals. The battle of Crait was like the battle of Hoth (the rebellion, as it is now being called again, are being punished by the bad guys and they need to escape). Snoke makes Rey watch the Resistance be demolished in space (like Palpatine with Luke at the battle of Endor). The only new things was the casino which makes it feel like a Dinsey film not a Star Wars film, Luke's character and Star Wars trying to be comedy. Rey hardly has any training and still kicks ass (because of all the feminists today trying to say women are better), Ackbar, a great rebel leader loved by many fans, dies and nobody cared, Holdo takes over and cant be bothered telling her crew what her plan is, causing a huge fight between everybody and waite until most of the Resistance escape pods have been destroyed. Poe turns from a strict pilot who knows what to do to becoming a joker and making decisions he knows that are wrong to blow up a dreadnought, causing most of the fleet to vanquish. And last but not least of all the HUGE disappointments is Leia being able to fly, this one is self exlanatory and I dont need to say anything here. But here is everything I liked about the film now:Thanks for reading.","The Last Jedi",71,4.1,3.6
"72",1.5,"  Biggest flop in SW history. Horrible story telling, killed nearly all continuity and context. Poor decisions, bad writing and characters we are forced to care about... but still don't. They ruined all potential with the classic characters, opting for quick gimmicks and surprises over good character arcs. It's a pretty film, Disney production but, it pretty much ruins Star Wars for me.","The Last Jedi",72,4.1,2.6
"73",1,"  Just more reboots. Lacks that Lucasfilm imagination in ships, planets, characters and story. The death of a legacy.","The Last Jedi",73,4.1,3.1
"74",0.5,"  Too many inconsistencies. The Force Awakens had a few, but this carries it to new heights. As a hardcore fan of Star Wars, I'm not someone who is hard to please. I want to like anything with the brand name. This one, I can;t.First, Rose is on the same level as Jar Jar Binks. Not the actresses fault, just a poorly written story. The entire Fin & Rose arc was TERRIBLE. Fin was somewhat redeemable at the end when he attempts to sacrifice himself, which then gets foiled by Rose.The bombers in this movie are pathetic. Y-Wings would have been far better for the bombing run at the start. All the villains feel incompetent instead of clever. Not to mention, supposedly the First Order has been in the shadows moving so as to not attract attention, then in this movie they are apparently the unstoppable war machine.Rey is still a Mary Sue. Luke is a sissy. And talk about a slap to the face, we don't even get to see Luke mourn for his best friend Han Solo. Additionally, Luke isn't even Luke. You know, Luke, who risked all to save his father. In this movie, he tries to kill his nephew on a whim.What was that last battle? Sure, we'll throw the EU out. Then in Rogue One we show that Star Destroyers have the ability to hover above a city. But in this movie, the Star Destroyers can't enter the planet's atmosphere? One Star Destroyer could've destroyed the entire base at the end no problem.Nope, instead lets land a full mile away and slowly walk an attack force up to the door.This movie was pathetic. It wasn't even enjoyable. I'm not digging into EU concepts because Disney said they don't matter. Fine. At least make a movie that makes sense. This one didn't even fit with any of the past movies. And to make it worse, I came out only having enjoyed one scene, and that was the Kylo Ren fight. (Snoke's death was also as pathetic as the rest of the movie)","The Last Jedi",74,4.1,3.6

"82",5,"  I am not 100% certain as to why this is getting such good reviews with critics, and such terrible reviews with audience. Is it possible that so many audience members truly had no idea what they were going to see? This is quintessential Star Wars, and the newer generation is wrecking the acting of the original one. Mark Hamill's acting in this, is the WORST part of the movie. No one is giving Adam Driver enough credit, and YES the ""last jedi"" is going to be a god damned woman! Why is everyone having such a hard time with this? Rey is 10x the jedi that Luke was anyway. I don't get it. I really feel as though everyone forgot that this is the 8th film in a franchise. Did you see 1-3? Go complain over there.","The Last Jedi",82,4.1,-0.9
"83",1.5,"  Another movie franchise that should not have been remade. Lost the movie magic from the classic, now they have made into a crappy film. My 'favorite' part of the movie is when Princess leia dies, but somehow magically flies back to the ship. If you kill a character - kill the character.","The Last Jedi",83,4.1,2.6
"84",0.5,"  I am sorry to say that this movie did little to nothing to advance the franchise of Star Wars. In fact it did a lot of damage. The story writing was bland and the movie editing techniques were poor. Strong story writing raises all characters to the next level. It is not totally dafaming some characters in order to raise others up.Furthermore it leaves us with little to look forward to. If the Mantra of Star Wars is Hope against all odds, this movie did what it told me I need to to It Failed in all categories except one. the visuals were great, and that is all credited to the CGI team and not the director or the producers. Episode 9 has it's work cut out for it. Good Luck JJ.","The Last Jedi",84,4.1,3.6
"85",0.5,"  This was easily the most disappointing movie experience I have ever had. Abrams did a fantastic job with The Force Awakens , creating an intriguing new story and developing meaningful characters essential the to the trilogy. However, all of that is nullified in this movie. The movie revolves around a sense of magical realism that only small children with no higher than a 1st grade education could find remotely plausible, even for a Star Wars movie. The director of The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson, is either the least qualified person on earth to direct a movie or he intended to decimate the characters and plot that were set up in The Force Awakens. He provided us a film with literally no significance or resemblance to the other movies, ruined the integrity of the franchise and introduced absolutely ZERO meaningful plot twists or sequences to set up the next movie. Disney should seriously consider making a another second installment to replace this atrocity as it would generate more revenue for them and provide Star Wars fans with a restored purpose to watch the third installment.","The Last Jedi",85,4.1,3.6

WRONG..... canto bite is so poor and makes no difference to the plot I'm sure it's a joke played on us all and mr Johnson is laughing in his SJW dark bubble wondering how he got away with this hatchet job.

"95",0.5,"  I can't believe how bad this movie was. I've been a huge Star Wars fan since I was 6, and this movie was horrible. The characters we've come to love are exploited in what is essentially creative expression gone wild. It ignores established character traits, and attempts to create emotionally charged connections with new characters we don't even hear speak. Creating very awkward distractions. Star Wars has always tweaked the laws of physics to a certain extent, but the opening battle is ridiculously over the top. Not to mention the first orders ridiculously poor performance. Worst yet the plot try's to reference today's political atmosphere in not so subtle references to feminism, racism, and Marxist references to social inequality. An all to familiar pattern now of the bad white men was quite oblivious. The only exception (Poe) essentially acting like a child who won't listen to his mothers. That is when he wasn't killing everyone by himself. Seriously it was like watching someone play Mario cart at times. I'm going to try and forget this movie was ever made.","The Last Jedi",95,4.1,3.6

"99",2,"  This looked like a Star Wars film but it sucked my head, heart and soul dry. I hated the SJW Agendas and pissed me off big time. Visual effects, sound design and musical score was good. Most of the deleted scenes in the DVD should have been included in the movie. Ruin Reylo Johnson is an arrogant snobby self righteous novice filmmaker and bad writer.

I'm not going to talk about the weak characters or pepper thin plot, that has already been done. Let's instead talk about the horrable treatment of legacy characters. Who are these people??? Luke would never act the way he did. Leia was a non factor. Chewie was pointless..... yada yada.... look I'm not passing judgment on you if you liked this movie and to be honest I didn't hate it. That said.... if this is where the franchise is going eh I will wait till the come to blu ray.... then again I might be out.","The Last Jedi",104,4.1,2.6
"105",0.5,"  SPOILERS: A lot of plot holes, wasted opportunities, and character assassination of Luke's character. Rey is stronger than Luke with almost no training. Finn meets Rose and goes on a pointless mission. Leia floats through the vacuum of space and doesn't die, even though it would have made sense because Carrie Fisher (RIP) passed away during post-production. The Knights of Ren are gone and its never explained what happened to them. Are they Snoke's bodyguards? Who knows? Poe becomes a dumb stereotypical ""male rebel"" character. They never explain how Snoke brought Kylo to the dark side, didn't explain how Kylo killed Luke's students. Luke try's to kill Kylo or (Been Solo) in his sleep even though Luke almost died to prove that there was good in Darth Vader. Rey's parents are nobodies. Didn't explain how or why Rey hears voices from Obi-Wan and see's visions from Lukes 1st battle with Vader, in the Force Awakens when she touches Luke's Lightsaber. Luke sends a projection of himself to fight Kylo so the rebels can escape, but even though he just projects an image of himself he still dies? I could go on but these were the big ones. This movie disappointed a lot of fans. Also hated the fact that Finn is supposed to be an Important character for blacks (because I'm an African-American Male) and He is a useless character. But whatever I'm just another ""Fan Boy"" according to the producers.","The Last Jedi",105,4.1,3.6

"107",0.5,"  Star Wars Episode VII The Last Insult is atrocious. George Lucas would be rolling in his grave if he wasn't still alive. The Farce Awakens didn't do him in, but this just might. He should buy up Disney. Get control of his movies back. And then break out that same hammer that he wanted to use to smash every copy of The Star Wars Holiday Special. P.S. This makes The Phantom Menace look like Citizen Kane by comparison.","The Last Jedi",107,4.1,3.6
"108",0.5,"  The worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. The Prequels put this film to shame. Characters feel completely forced in and unnatural into the Star Wars universe, plot points from the previous film are forgotten or answers in a way that makes them feel unimportant and makes you appear stupid for thinking they were. Disrespects the mythos of Star Wars and its original characters, and to top it all of, the high ups at Lucasfilm continue to insult the original fans for not liking this movie. Basically if you don't like this movie, your a man baby, a racist, an sexist, and you live in your parents basement. Do not support the Star Wars IP under the influence of Kathleen Kennedy. Do the exact opposite of what Kylo Ren tells you to do. Let the past live, revive it if you have to.","The Last Jedi",108,4.1,3.6

"110",0.5,"  I was excited for this movie, and I remember going opening night. Now, I'm a fan who will willingly go to the theaters to rewatch the Phantom Menace in 3D (and I hate 3D). I love the prequels, I love almost everything star wars related, and even with all it's flaws, I enjoy Force Awakens (it was a rehash, and Rey was to perfect of a character, but it had promise). With this though, it's the first time that I didn't want to rewatch it, I didn't want to go back and see it again, I don't even want to go see Solo or 9. That's a problem if a fan such as I, who eats up almost everything star wars doesn't even want to see it or other things from this current trilogy any longer.","The Last Jedi",110,4.1,3.6
"111",1,"  Bad story telling, is disjoint from The Force Awakens and tried to hard to be something different. I have no issues with Luke dying or Snoke dying. But I have issues on why Luke decides to kill Ben as is not convincing, nor was how Be becoming Kylo as it was just due to Luke's igniting his lightsaber. Poorly build up, poorly done. Leia the mother of Ben does not come out of the ase to confront her son, what kind of mother in the world would do this?","The Last Jedi",111,4.1,3.1
"112",0.5,"  The last Jedi is so disappointing on so many levels","The Last Jedi",112,4.1,3.6
"113",1.5,"  If Star Wars: The Force Awakens left you intrigued over its mysteries and cliffhangers, lower your expectations now. Watching The Last Jedi, it's unclear whether Rian Johnson has never seen The Force Awakens, or was simply uninterested in the foundation it built for the new trilogy. Either way, nearly every plot thread and mystery established in TFA is at best ignored, and at worst given the most disappointing resolution possible.Even beyond its disregard for its immediate predecessor, The Last Jedi is so poorly written it's hard to believe. Plot holes, lore inconsistencies, and absurd conveniences abound. The entirety of the story hinges on a well-established character acting in complete contrast to his/her well-established personality, with almost no explanation. Future Star Wars films will have to work desperately to patch the holes blown into the fabric of this world and its workings, as The Last Jedi irreversibly changes the series' mechanics of space travel and combat. Further, the movie's shoehorned morals are at best nonsensical and at worst sociopathic. If you see the movie with a crowd, you will likely be able to hear the sound of eyes rolling in tandem at one particularly preachy scene, as Star Wars' new worst character delivers Star Wars' new worst line and demonstrates the film's creators' incredible lack of self-awareness.That said, some small amount of credit must be given for the film's striking visuals and a few standout performances. In particular, Mark Hamill gives perhaps the best performance yet in any Star Wars film and demonstrates his incredible professionalism in the face of a very poor script. Unfortunately, his talent, presence, and gravitas are dramatically underused.Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a nihilistic, depressing, and straight-up dumb story that squanders its nearly every opportunity, and leaves the Star Wars canon broken likely beyond repair.","The Last Jedi",113,4.1,2.6
"114",1,"  Definitely very boring and too long, but the unacceptable apects are the loopholes in the plot and the poor character arcs. As a Star Wars fan, it's sad to see the way Disney has gone with the new films. The Force Awakens tried to be a carbon copy of A New Hope thus opening large gaps in the story, while this film doesn't fill in any of the plot holes and doesn't even follow the plots introduced in Awakens. Who is Snoke? How'd he come into power? Nevermind - he's really dumb and is now dead. How do people think the Jedi are a myth only 30 years later? Why does no one know about ""The Force?"" Nah - anyone can tap into the force at will without training - especially people that are nobodies, go to arguably the greatest Jedi for training, get denied said training, decide to go meet two of the most powerful people of the dark side, and are equally as matched to them and manage to kill everyone and escape unscathed. I'm not going to mention anything about Luke Skywalker's character arc because it's so ridiculously off target there are way too many things to even break down. So basically, it's a disaster and the writers should be embarrassed with their efforts.","The Last Jedi",114,4.1,3.1

"117",4.5,"  Star Wars is a long series with many ups and downs, and after the Force Awakens, it's formula was starting to get old. Choosing Rian Johnson to direct such a big-budget film was a risky move by Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, but it ultimately paid off. Johnson has completely refreshed Star Wars, giving it a chance to continue without repetitiveness or staleness. No other director could have pulled off something like this without such a flourish of amazing visual symbolism, interesting story, great character renderings, uproarious comedy, and glorious action scenes. This is definitely a Star Wars movie to be remembered, but one that is not without it's flaws. The Canto Bight scene, while beautiful, drags on and ultimately accomplishes nothing, as does Benicio Del Toro's entertaining but unnecessary character. All in all, Rian Johnson did a surprisingly great job with The Last Jedi, and it is no wonder that he is getting to start his own trilogy which will undoubtedly be as good or better!","The Last Jedi",117,4.1,-0.4

The movie trashes who Luke Skywalker was in the return of the jedi. KYLO is a whinny punk who temper tantrums his way thru the film and you never buy into him as a bad guy to fear. the first order is an army of stooges who can't seem to get things right.

This one is made in America trash, too -- just look at the horrible audience reviews!! You can't argue with that!!Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, midichlorians, silly bad guy names like Dooku and General Grievous, Hayden Christensen's bad acting, Mark Hamill's bad acting, Carrie Fisher's bad acting, Natalie Portman's bad acting, the execrable Padme and Anakin ""romance"" -- that stuff already ruined Star Wars.Hopefully, for the next Star Wars movie, Rose Tico becomes the most powerful Jedi of all time without any training whatsoever and single-handedly destroys Kylo Ren, the First Order, and a whole slew of evil white men.Ha ha, have fun whining and crying, losers!!","The Last Jedi",123,4.1,-0.9

I would suggest not watching this movie, as we seem to be almost exactly where we started in the movie. The Disney/Marvel influence pandering to foreign audiences is palpable, and quite detracting from the franchise. This physically pained me to watch one of my favorite take such a hit. Please fire whoever the hell you decided to direct this, and bring back the old franchise.","The Last Jedi",130,4.1,3.6
"131",0.5,"  I've waited a long time to write this review and probably do not have anything to say that has not already been said. I'm terribly disappointed in this movie and in the critical response to it. Critics look at films for such things as relevance, plot, structure. We study critical theory and look closer at a film than the general audience, priding ourselves for understanding such things as narrative and context. Critics look at every scene for often ridiculous pieces of evidence to apply to ambiguous theories and this is why critics are so often out of touch with what an audience enjoys. When people are enjoying a great story, critics are delving into the subtext and looking for inapplicable symbols to express their theory; whether its an insane focus on phallic and yonic symbolism or Freudian stretches to an Oedipal complex, or forcing the characters into a Marxist clash that doesn't exist in the script. Then you have a trainwreck of a film like this which audiences are immediately turned off to and somehow critics jump to the other side and praise the film for all of its worst attributes. Suddenly narrative does not matter. That the majority of the film was wasted on a subplot that made no sense somehow escapes the notice of critics. Those of us who criticize the film are lambasted as disillusioned ""fan boys"" or heckled for wishing the film was just like Empire. This is nonsense. This whole film was nonsense but what is particularly upsetting about it was its missed potential. Johnson introduced a number of compelling ideas, gave us a taste of them, had us lean in for a second, and then snatched it away for no reason at all. People say that the fans who disliked the film are holding on to the Skywalker legacy or some other nostalgia, but that's not true. I wanted new Star Wars. Nothing would have made me happier than having something new and exciting, but that's not what this film did. It kept making itself look like it was going to do that and then just pulled away and killed itself...every chance it got. There is no way that anyone watching this film can make sense of it because if there is a theme to this movie, it is that nothing matters. Nothing that happened before matters, and everything will just work itself out in the end so nothing that happens now matters, either. SPOILERS AHEAD: This film builds on J.J. Abrams' Episode VII which, while there were some issues with the film, was in retrospect a fairly solid platform for this trilogy to build upon. Abrams introduced some very compelling characters and integrated the familiar faces from the original franchise very well. There were some plot holes and a few inconsistencies and errors of logic (such as Han looking up at the sky and seeing the republic capitol planets exploding when he should not have been able to) but some of these are to be expected in Star Wars. The original films are full of logical fallacies that we can easily ignore. Johnson, however, took logical inconsistency to a whole new place. One very large problem that maybe other people aren't bothered with, are the issues with time. Previous films have also taken some liberty with the concept of time. Empire has Luke running to Dagobah and spending what seems to be months in training with Yoda in the same time that Han and Leia are spending a few hours running from Vader's fleet (which can be accounted for with the amount of time it might have taken them at sublight speed to reach Bespin). Episode II had Yoda assemble and transport an entire army of clone troopers from the outer rim to Geonosis in the couple of hours that Anakin and Obi-wan were held captive. The fleet in Rogue One manages to respond nearly instantly to an air strike call and the large battle at the end of the film despite that the supported characters were several hours ahead of them. In Episode 8, however, we're made to believe that a fleeing capitol ship containing the remnants of the resistance is given 16 hours worth of fuel (worst ticking clock device ever), and in that time, much of which is already consumed by Finn's recovery and attempted escape, Finn and Rose are able to flee the ship (which also made no sense with the device of the ship moving too fast for fighters to be able to attack it), jump to another star system, search a casino city, get arrested, spend a night in a jail cell, flee from the police, be ""rescued"" by another person, and get back to the place where the resistance is being pursued. This is a minor problem when you consider that nothing they did on that planet made any sense or had any real purpose. They had to find ""code breaker"" (spend two weeks coming up with that name, Disney?"", but they get arrested instead...but that's okay, we don't need code breaker anyway. He was the only person who could sneak them onto a star destroyer, but doesn't matter because there's another person in the jail cell with them who can do the same thing that he was the only possible person to do. Rey needs a teacher, but Luke won't do it...but that's okay, because she doesn't really need a teacher anyway. But then Yoda tells Luke that they can't lose Rey, so Luke does absolutely nothing to help her anyway. Luke dies, leaving no one to train Rey, but that's okay because the books that Yoda burned somehow made it onto the Falcon. The resistance is trapped in cave with only one way out and they lose the fight, but that's okay because there's another way out of the back that didn't exist before. Then you have Finn doing the one thing that gave his character real meaning. A decision that Finn made to put his fear aside to be the real hero and he commits himself and it's real and it's meaningful, but then Rose crashes into him and prevents it. And then somehow they make it from the middle of the plain surrounded by imperials with both of their vehicles completely destroyed, but somehow they beat the First Order back to the base and manage to escape with everyone else. Everything that was compelling and moving in this film was wasted with LAZY, LAZY, LAZY points of convenience. You can't throw that many ""coincidences"" into a film and expect anyone to find it meaningful. Everything that happened in this film cheapened the characters and their choices because nothing matters... some convenient coincidence will always be there to save the day. This is a mere fraction of the problems with this film.","The Last Jedi",131,4.1,3.6
"132",0.5,"  Could have a Star Wars movie gone worst than the Last Jedi? I don't think so. Plot holes everywhere, even impossible facts for being Star Wars are tremendously pathetic (See 'Mary Poppins in outer space' or 'The lion that starved to death because nyus were too cute'). Boring characters, zero respect for the original saga and extremely long. Seems that quality doesn't matter anymore, just do as much money as possible by going faster than the lightning releasing movies and introducing cute little creatures to sell them as toys; or even buying the critics to give them more box office. It is understandable tha kids and some people might like it, but someone with small knowledge in cinema can clearly distinguish that this movies is just awful. The half star is for the visual effects.","The Last Jedi",132,4.1,3.6
"133",2,"  Even after watching this movie a second time I just couldn't find any real value in it. It completely drifted away from what made Star Wars great and it feels like we're being fed a social justice diatribe on screen. Every villain is a white guy and every hero is a feminist or minority fighting against the 1%. I get that we should be trying to be inclusive, but this was so obviously forced. It's as if it was written specifically for the Hollywood elite to stroke their own conscience. I'm not saying we shouldn't cast minorities or women to be the hero's, I'm all in favor of that. But this movie goes beyond that and tries to stereotype every white male as bad and every minority as good. It gives the impression that women must be masculine to be hero's and white men are evil because, well hey they're white men!","The Last Jedi",133,4.1,2.1

Rey was a personal favorite, yet I hoped to see Poe Dameron and Fin develop as characters. Instead, I received a nonsense plot that stifles the growth of the new characters I love.-Finn and Rose's storylines make no sense. None of he characters grow. -Rey is now Korra from Legend if Korra.-The movie manages to make Poe, a very level headed guy, out to be a bad guy for not listening to a crazy lady with purple hair.-Luke Skywalker gets plunked.-weird YodaNo one takes any responsibility in this movie, much like the corporate glutton hat spawned it.

"138",4,"  As I look around the Internet and see fan reaction to ""The Last Jedi"" I get this general impression. Fans didn't like ""The Force Awakens"" because it was too similar. Now fans don't like ""The Last Jedi"" because it's too different. I definitely have my issues with some of the story logic and some of the scenes (one sequence in particularly was just so poorly conceived and executed). In general, however, I really liked this entry quite a bit. While I had many places I'd like to have gone, ideas I wanted for it, and to have my Star Wars fanboy desired fulfilled, I like how Rian Johnson played with and undercut expectations laying the ground for new, fresh stories for the Future of Star Wars. So far, I'd say the new movies, so far have hovered at ""The Return of the Jedi"" level of, good additions to the Star Wars franchise, but haven't transcended into excellent films the way the first ""Star Wars"", and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did.","The Last Jedi",138,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"151",0.5,"  I just need to add my personal impression to this movie, because Star Wars was (not ""is"" anymore) an epic fantasy saga with a lot of humanity and focused on characters.Now it is just some forgettable Marvelish Avengerish useless movie.Wait, some of those movies are actually good, but overall they are not at all close to any Star Wars movie, but this.Plot is very, very bad. Everything ""good"" in the movie is just a predictable copy-paste from the first trilogy. The new things are just horrible and make no sense.I could go deeper into details, but I feel it would be wasted time for this garbage.I had fun watching this, because I was with friends and we were actually enjoying laughing at every crap proposed.

Being part of a saga demands to have come continuity between the movies before this one and in this case, it feels right from the first 5 minutes of the movie like an intent from the director to scratch over the movies before and try something new, even if in the process it could burn all the good stuff from before. It has just too many plot holes that can't be forgiven. It suggests viewers to go on an argument to leave it behind like trash consuming a lot of screen time.

Brilliant music by John Williams improving on his previous 'Force Awakens' soundtrack. Brilliant performances from the entire cast, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill standing out as the best. The film pays respects to the legacy of the original trio and pushes them in an unexpected direction that fans who are open to change will be eager to see. Not without its problems the film is boggled down by Canto Bight scenes, not by the ideas, but by the execution. Rian Johnson is able to create excellent ideas but sometimes struggles to execute them well.","The Last Jedi",171,4.1,-0.4
"172",0.5,"  I went to the European premiere dammit! At the Albert Hall! I talked to Daisy Ridley and that woman from Jurassic Park but fark me if I wasn't feeling superior the whole damn time. ""You idiots! You wasted Millions of dollars, thousands of people's time and a boat load of expensive catering for this?"" During the film, I found myself wandering the corridors of the Albert Hall, muttering ""It's the death of Star Wars"" under my breath as the treble filtered sounds of this absolute steaming pile wafted through to me via each balcony I passed. The worst thing it was was unfunny where they'd tried to be. Seriously? Comedy? In a Star Wars film? Did you not know about JAR JAR FARKIN' BINKS?! It's like all these people, so called captains of their industry are just children, walking around with monkeys playing cymbals in their brains as they try to pass off being grown ups to other moronic children with lots of money.

Kathleen Kennedy needs to step down and let someone else take the reigns, and Rain Johnson should never be allowed to even watch another Star Wars film, let alone direct one.

"176",0.5,"  Rain Johnson was a scapegoat for Disney to perform culture shift take over. Star Wars has been a pop culture magnetic for central themes that are archetypes for societal norms/roles. That's why episode 7 was a copy of 4, draw us in/cash in., but most of it was thrown away in 8. The end goal wasn't about any fair treatment of the skywalker legacy, but - with contempt and arrogance- move past the old propaganda to their new. I can't believe Disney is this incompetent, this is a calculated risk with an expected bigger payoff..","The Last Jedi",176,4.1,3.6

I am only interested in how the world should be in my view. Rianne: what do you mean? Kathleen: Well even though in REAL history men did all the fighting, all the dying, all the hard physical labor, in my reality they were really always the suppressors of all the womenfolk. Rianne: how.....? KAthleen: I didnot hire you to think, DO IT YOU SPINELESS MORON. Rianne: okay, okay. I will kill of this totally heroic dude I heard off called Luke in the most lame manner possible. Kathleen: love it already. Rianne: I wil do a ""Yo mamma"" joke. Kathleen: Love it. Can't you do a fart joke for the kids? Or something really dumb to cheer on for the kids? Rianne: sure. I have a few jokes. Throwing away lightsaber over shoulder by Luke: hilarious! Kathleen: Okay girlfriend. Do as i tell you and you can make a trilogy. Rianne: wow thanks., but i really have not seen all the earlier movies. Kathleen: whatever. I want all the men be jokes, be angry boys or worldwar 2 SS-guys. How hard can it be? Rianne: euhhh? Can i make this snoke ... Kathleen: No he is a bad man, some kind a starwars-Hitler, so he has to die silly. Rianne: why? Kathleen: cause all the men are some kinda Hitlers, do i have tot explain everything? Rianne: no, no, daddy, I mean momma.Phasma - female SS-leader. What does the viewer see: beautifull woman but totally unconvincing as a character. Motives: just wants to be mean in a shiny harnass? What is her driving force? But again an NPC who is killed of against an invincible lead character, no surprise here. 1-Dimensional character, the archetype is the ""evil"" person.Holdo - an heroic female admiral. What does the viewer see: An NPC who choses to help the cause by killing herself while destroying the capital ship of the enemy. Beautifull actress but why? Don't they have remotes in the future?

Comedy that breaks the seriousness of every important character moment- A movie that doesn t respects continuity with the rest of the saga or even itself. Also we can note poor editing, useless characters and moments that break the universe rules. That rounded by a mary sue of a character has only three saving graces. the relation between kylo and rey, the awesome visuals and the porgs.......fucking porgs.","The Last Jedi",184,4.1,2.6
"185",1.5,"  This Disney trilogy feels like so much bad fan fiction.","The Last Jedi",185,4.1,2.6
"186",2.5,"  The movie honestly leaves you bewildered after the first billing. You are in awe because it is star wars, but also confused because it doesn't exactly read as starwars either. After multiple viewings, the negatives really weigh down the positives. The movie has a strong issue with pacing, character development and also the addition of unnecessary scenes and sub plots that don't really add to the main conflict of the story. Along with this there is a saturation of characters that do not fit the established star wars aesthetic, and seem to be there for the sake of representation and even politics outside of the franchise. Sadly the established characters also suffer, and instead feel like new characters who are only related to their former iterations by name, ie Luke. A heroic character like Luke still could of have been portrayed as someone despaired by tragedies and wants to break from old traditions, but the execution was poorly done. Lastly, the film feels like an end to a series instead of a middle film to a trilogy. And besides that, there isn't a strong continuation between 7 and 8 like their predecessors in the saga. The movie is still a beautiful example of cinematography in an artistic form stronger than previous films. Also if you focus generally on Rey and Kylo's tension, especially when confronted by Snoke, you will be captivated especially when considering the poetry of the past films that led up to their characters. Hoping for the best with the concluding film to this trilogy to bring back what made Star War really captivating.","The Last Jedi",186,4.1,1.6
"187",2.5,"  The force awakens was so much better. This sits way below expectations of any true Starwars fan!","The Last Jedi",187,4.1,1.6
"188",1.5,"  I did enjoy some of this film but there was a lot that I really hated, not simply disliked but HATED. Luke has been turned into a morose, cowardly, murderous douche-bag who looks like Sam Kinison. Finn is still an unfunny, bumbling, coward that brings nothing to the story. Rey's character was improved in my opinion however overall the story is a downer, the whole side story of Finn and Rose running off to Casino Royale was dull and ultimately stupid, introducing Benicio Del Toro's character was pointless, those little pog things were annoying and a vein attempt to create new merchandising for Disney. Snoke and Rey's backstory's being shrugged away as nothing was lazy and... stupid! The space battles were cool but there's little to like in this smelly nugget of sci-fi fantasy. As soon as he shuffles out of this mortal coil Lucas will spin in his grave!","The Last Jedi",188,4.1,2.6

It's time to grow up fanboys. From the heart stopping action to the compelling characters that Rian Johnson took to the next level, this movie really takes Star Wars from the old and into the new. Not looking forward to Episode IX cause J.J. will just ruin it again. Can't wait for the new trilogy from Rian Johnson.

What I can't forgive is the shameful mishandling of the Star Wars universe and particularly of its beloved iconic characters. Luke is pathetic in this movie. He's not Luke - he is Star Wars - I can understand why he needs to be out of the way to tell the next chapter, but he should have died a hero, he should have died with a noble sacrifice. Star Wars operates on the level of archetype, it's why it has such a broad cultural appeal, it's why the characters are beloved and celebrated. It's about the hero's journey, the noble sacrifice, good vs evil.The writing and direction utterly failed in this movie. Disney, and particularly JJ and Rian, lack the creative vision to do Star Wars, they're just milking it for money at this point.This movie is downright offensive to the Star Wars universe.

Plus, superman Leia is just comical. I'm sorry Mark Hamill. Kathleen Kennedy is a cancer to this series.","The Last Jedi",215,4.1,3.6
"216",1,"  The story is a total mess, for starters. It's packed with narrative holes and leaden dialogue, and the whole enterprise is hopelessly trapped inside a tortuous series of incompatible timelines that stretch credibility well beyond anything that even setting the story in a galaxy far, far away can excuse.The film's tone is all over the place, too, switching horribly awkwardly between (usually painfully lame) humor, serious 'Force stuff' and lots of people dying without even trying to establish any sort of context for its changing moods.Dull, messy scripts can sometimes be rescued by great direction. But sadly, despite his enjoyable efforts with Looper, writer/director Rian Johnson consistently fluffs the job of filming his own words.Tense scenes fail to build tension. Dramatic scenes deliver no drama. Emotionally charged scenes lack emotional charge. Fight scenes look horribly stilted and leaden. Jokes generally feel so labored or are delivered so abruptly that they feel more like a slap in the face than something that might actually make you laugh.I really can't think of a single important scene where you get any sense that Johnson understands how to use imagery to add power to the film's generally underwhelming events.The Last Jedi's many filmmaking fails left me with almost nothing I could latch on to in order to become immersed in the action, leaving me desperate for the whole dull mess to come to an end at least an hour before it did. And once the criminally drab conclusion was finally reached, I couldn't help but find myself comparing The Last Jedi with Alien 3 in terms of its franchise-crushing awfulness.","The Last Jedi",216,4.1,3.1

The movie focuses on a more comedic aspect and falls short even on that note and even kills off one of the better characters only for that to fail the audience as a beloved character doesn't receive a death he deserves. The only good thing are the visuals and the fact Star Wars is in the title, oh and don't forgot the laser swords that can be so easily learned that anyone could do it..","The Last Jedi",224,4.1,3.1

"228",2,"  The script is really only a bit above adequate in this film. Humor attempt was awkward, ill placed and political sub themes were so flipping annoying. It's like a virus in films we can't get rid of now. What bothered me most was Luke looking like he'd been hitting the bottle a bit too much atop his retreat. There was one scene I loved where Luke got excited to see R2 and it was great watching him again. Then he sunk into this deep voice that drove me nuts - yeah, he was old but old Ben still looked sober at least. I think most people agree you CAN follow up a great film with a great film (Empire Strikes Back) but it clearly didn't happen here. Who approves these final cuts of the film is what I want to know and why would they do this after such a great film like the Force Awakens?","The Last Jedi",228,4.1,2.1

"230",1,"  The final nail in the coffin that made me quit whatever StarWars, that Disney puts out. Just like I quit Star Trek.At the moment I am perfectly fine with reading any StarWars book published pre-2012, before watching any of these feminist-infected logic-deprived SJW-trash filled with character-assassinations of any known male. I was appalled that they weren't even subtle about what their agenda was. Force Awakens was at least watchable.2 months before watching this in december I began to see the signs after classifying the structure that these people uses to base their story around. Because they don't care about keeping inside the boundary of established lore or create characters that has exciting and interesting challenges to overcome and grow from. Both inside and outside.SJW's has an idea that they want to show women as morally superior in any way, while men being brutish and wrong, even though they actually have a point.But that is not all. Every decision for this movie's story was completely retarded and it wasted every interesting plotline and characters to the point of stupidity. And that is not counting Luke Skywalker's 180 degree change in his personality without any reasonable justification other than to tell a joke and make the main character of Rey being even more morally superior than she already is. Everything was so dull.The movie effectively killed off anything that was interesting in StarWars(from Force Awakens) to the point that there is absolutely no reason to watch it anymore.But it is all okay, I believe. Even though they wasted the opportunity to having Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford back in these movie, this will stand as a testimony of how to not treat a franchise as the market balances itself out, and no one caring anymore whenever Disney puts out more StarWars.I will be fine reading through loads of books from the legends canon, knowing that it can only be much better than this crap. Maybe in 10 - 15 years, StarWars will come back in the way it should be...Untill then, I will do other stuff :D","The Last Jedi",230,4.1,3.1

"232",0.5,"  when I went in to see this film opening night I was excited to see Luke Skywalker return, I was ready to see space battles and lightsaber fights, I was ready to see a good movie. What I got was a MASSIVE disappointment the story was all over the place, Rey was a Mary Sue, the casino planet was unnecessary to the plot, Luke Skywalker dying enraged me, and the fact that the purple haired leader couldn't tell Po the plan because he was a hot shot is the worst reason I have ever heard of. The First Order's military leaders who are supposed to be a representation of the Nazi's who fled to South American and regrouped don't have any competent leaders in their ranks. Whats worse the comedy derails the plot on several occasions and hurts the serious tone that the movie is going for. Now a few subtle jokes from C3P0 and Chewbacca would have been fine but to have as many ""jokes"" that the movie did I thought I was trying to be a bad sequel to Space Balls. Also as this was the final film with Carrie Fisher I felt as though it would have been better if Leia died in the attack on the main bridge of the ship. It would have been a huge emotional blow to the audience and it would have had an impact on the characters in the movie, instead they pulled a Mary Poppins out of no where showing she has force powers that are equal to that of Luke despite the fact she never had any official force training, this turns an emotional death scene that would have surpassed the death of Han Solo and it would show that this movie had balls. Instead the film decided that ""Nope we are going to keep her alive for no reason other than the fact that we want her to live and kill Luke off because we want him t die."" I am disappointed with Disney and I am disappointed with Cathleen Kennedy as they should have written a better script and take a page out of the two previous trilogies for how to write a proper script.This movie is on the same level as a bad fanfiction. -10/10 will not buy the DVD or Blu-Ray, do not recommend anyone to see.","The Last Jedi",232,4.1,3.6

"241",0.5,"  Rian Johnson has successfully changed the landscape of Star Wars forever. While that may be great for some including critics it's very bad for others. Star Wars is a franchise that is built on the backs of it's fans most of whom have followed the franchise for 40 years. These same fans have introduced this franchise to their children also. Kylo REn pretty much sums up what Rian Johnson has done when he makes the statement ""Kill the past"" You can make good Star Wars movies without destroying what people already know and love. I wont even get into the fact that Rey is a Mary Sue. THat Leia is superman. Or any of the SJW stuff that was throughout this film. Fact still remains that the movie is making a killing This movie has made a billion dollars on the backs of the people that this movie slaps in the face.if i had three hands I would give it three thumbs down but I only have two so two thumbs downThis is not the star wars you grew up on its more Hunger games meets Battlestar Galactica","The Last Jedi",241,4.1,3.6

As a movie, it's utter garbage; as a STAR WARS movie, it's an abomination. Do yourself a favor and avoid this tripe. In fact, you would be doing yourself a huge favor by avoiding everything produced by Hollywood, turning off the TV, and reading books instead.","The Last Jedi",243,4.1,3.1
"244",1,"  Best cinematic qualities of all Star Wars films. Story lines were weakest of any SW film. The character development was very weak and unconvincing. The actors and actresses were excellent but the chemistry between each was in my opinion worse than the original trilogy but much better than the prequels. This should have been a standalone movie and separate from any particular trilogy or saga. Did not have the feel of a Star Wars movie. Sad. Wasted the character of Luke. I'm not mad because of his death but rather the poor story arc leading to this event. It should have been developed more and happened in the episode 9.","The Last Jedi",244,4.1,3.1

"246",0.5,"  Easily the second worst film in the franchise.","The Last Jedi",246,4.1,3.6
"247",1,"  This was the worst star wars movie I ever seen! Rian Johnson it is very clear he is not a good writer and he needed a co-writer for the movie. The plot holes are uncountable, the editing of the movie was very bad and sloppy, the scene with Finn meets Rose for the first time, Finn is about to enter a pod he place his bag outside the pod, when Rose talks to him, some how the bag gets inside the pot but worst on top of a chair lol. This is a very bad movie. Then they killed off Luke Skywalker, with an unreasonable reason projecting an image of himself kills him. Then they made Luke be a person who turn his back on the Force, and his friends and family. This image of Luke is hard to accept it like Captain American turn his back on America and start killing American citizens. Or like Superman turn his back on Lewis, and leave her to die when he can save her. The Last Jedi is the far worst Star Wars movie even though it had a big budget, and fancy visual it writing and plot fell through the roof. This why it has a low audience score. Then Finn in TFA Finn appeared he might be force senstive, why did he leave the first order what made him turn in TLJ this is ignored, and he was turned into a side character who did not even have no importance to the main plot. In the promotion of the Last Jedi they was showing Finn had a new blaster, he did not even use the blaster one time! Ouch! The Last Jedi was a lot of money invested in an non-experience writer and director, they should used someone more experiences like Spielberg or Ron Howard.","The Last Jedi",247,4.1,3.1
"248",1,"  terrible story, writing, and acting. The plot is poorly devised. It is sad that characters I've known for years turn up in terrible plot and story. This is very much similar to the three amigos 'those darn amigos'.","The Last Jedi",248,4.1,3.1
"249",1.5,"  The only good parts in this movie had to do with Luke and Rey. All the other new characters were terrible. Poe is the new Jar Jar Binks, except Jar Jar was a more competent commander. Leia and purple haired Laura Dern are the worst military minds ever. They don't share information with their underlings, leading to resentment and mutiny and then they laugh it off because Poe is cute. This move sets back women's rights 1000 years.This movie supposedly took risks. BS. If they really wanted to take a risk they would have killed off Finn in the part where Rose saves him because she's everything she despises. Finn's character would have gone through an amazing arc, actually giving a damn and sacrificing himself. Rose's character is pointless. Finn and Rose's wild adventure is pointless. The plotline of this movie is pointless.There were better plotline ideas on youtube channels than what actually came to pass here. Shame.","The Last Jedi",249,4.1,2.6
"250",1,"  Utter rubbish on so many levels. A real disappointment.","The Last Jedi",250,4.1,3.1
"251",1.5,"  Cinematography, lighting, costumes all wonderful. But this film did not preform good in believable character development, continuing a story smoothly, holding true to established rules from the new cannon, answering any questions established prior, and giving the audience a real reason to care about any new characters. The story falls flat with M. Night Shyamalan style twists that do not make you believe them. It is obvious that the director wanted to flaunt artistic flair but this flair was shallow and skin deep. If you take this film as an infinities of Star Wars it might be ok but in cannon it is utter trash disregarding everything but it's self. Bringing you incredible landscapes and scenes only to destroy them in order to shock you with lazy writing or cop outs. Plot demands personality changes that are unnatural for characters well established. This film really does just throw away everything you care about worse than Game of Thrones. Though Game of Thrones actually has a cohesive story and arcs most of the time where the last Jedi fails to even do that. . I recommend this film to anyone who want to know if they should bother with Star Wars anymore. The Last Jedi will give you a very loud in your face reason to never touch our beloved Star Wars again. I hope that Disney sees reason soon and changes something to make our Star Wars awesome again.","The Last Jedi",251,4.1,2.6

"255",0.5,"  Star wars the last feminist is the biggest disgrace to the star wars franchise as a whole. It honestly felt like a parody of star wars with a forced diversity agenda. There was a strong level of feminism throughout blatantly labeling men as stupid and reckless imbeciles. I feel like Rian Johnson has never even watched a star wars movie before because nothing about his film has a resemblance. There wasn't even a lightsaber duel in a 3 hour star wars film....... are you freaking dumb rian? My only last wish is that Disney drops the star wars rights because they have ruined it for mostly everyone.

"260",0.5,"  This is a very disappointing movie. It's totally out of context with the legacy of Star Wars and contradicts itself throughout the movie.

It ruined the legacy and my interest in Star Wars from this point forward. Half a star because it did look good sometimes.","The Last Jedi",260,4.1,3.6
"261",2,"  In trying to make a Star Wars film that subverts the fans' expectations Rian Johnson seems to have forgotten that he is making the second film in a trilogy series. The Last Jedi forgets or disregards many of the seemingly important plot points set up by its predecessor and where it does link up to The Force Awakens it does so with a brazen capriciousness that gets to be predictable in it's own right. From mishandled characters and inconsequential sub plots to jokes that seem out of place in a galaxy far far away Star Wars fans deserve better. Disney seems to have purchased the Mona Lisa with the intent of finger painting over it.","The Last Jedi",261,4.1,2.1

"263",0.5,"  Extremely disappointing. I like where they were going with Rey and Kylo, then nothing... Finally we get to see Snoke and then nothing... Finn and Rose story arc was completely pointless and made very little sense. Luke has been developing for 40+ years, and all of a sudden everything we thought we knew goes out the window. And my dear Carrie Fisher was turned into a joke. Rian Johnson has no respect for fans or the universe that was built. He was handed a golden canvas and wiped his ass with it. Oh my god the schtick comedy was over the top and out of place, cringe at best. Trying way too hard to force comedic moments, and i swear there were a few times they obviously paused for laughs. Nothing Luke did in this film in character, it was so far out of character you were left scratching your head. Easily the worst piece of SW canon ever conceived. I encourage all to watch at least once to form your own oponion, but expect to be disappointed. This is where Star Wars dies, and aside from from re shooting and re writing 75% of the movie to release a ""directors"" cut or whatever you want to call it. Episode IX can't reverse this. It hurts to see our/my childhood bastardized and so disrespected. Hopefully we will get a proper episode VIII, until then I will take comfort in the og trilogy and Rogue One. May the force be with anyone who can fix this abomination.","The Last Jedi",263,4.1,3.6

This movie elevated the prequels, and vaulted return of the jedi to the best one of the eight episodes simply because of the missed opportunity with luke. what a shame. it did have some good individual moments and a good soundtrack. my interest in episode iX & beyond is minimal because of this movie.","The Last Jedi",283,4.1,2.1

"286",3,"  SPOILER ALERT: I'm a huge Star Wars fan but it's not like all the Star Wars movies are going to be flawless masterpieces every time they are released. The Last Jedi is a good movie. It's not great, it's definitely not the best Star Wars movie since Empire. There are some things that The Last Jedi does that The Force Awakens didn't do well and vice versa. In this movie, while there are similarities other Star Wars movies, does not copy paste huge plot points from the previous films and slightly change it. This whole story is a breath of fresh air when it comes to Star Wars. I liked almost everything in this movie but the reason why I'm not giving it a higher rating is that the problems in this movie, granted there are only a few, are huge. There is a 20-minute scene on a planet called Canto bight (I think that's how it's spelled) in a casino and I hated it. It doesn't feel like Star Wars, it feels like something I'd see in Guardians of The Galaxy or, dare I say it, Valerian. It was just done so poorly. The only other thing that I thought was kind of stupid, even stupid for Star Wars, was Leia floating in space. That was just plain dumb. I was also not a fan of the really cheesy and forced love story between Finn and Rose. Kelly Marie Tran isn't a very good actress either. But there are some things that I really did love in this movie. I loved the Rey and Kylo fight scene, I loved Snoke's death right before that and Luke was really amazing in this movie. I've seen this movie four times at this point and it's taken me a lot of thinking to finally come up with a score but this film is a low 7/10. The Force Awakens is probably also a 7/10.","The Last Jedi",286,4.1,1.1
"287",1,"  NOTE: Apparently RottenTomatoes doesnt count 1/2 star or zero star ratings, make sure you give this movie ONE STAR to be counted. There is something REALLY fishy going on with the reviews on this movie. Disney is DEFINITELY paying or influencing the reviews. MAKE YOUR VOICE COUNT AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.Review of Social Justice Wars : The Last Mary Sue & the Diversity Crew:I remember watching The Phantom Menace as a 17 year old when it first came out and thinking ""wow, there is no way any future Star Wars movie could possibly be worse than this"".But the universe, in all its infinite wisdom & patience, just laughed, and nearly 18 years later, an took the older, wearier, and more tired version of me and subjected him to this abortion of a film.Where to begin? let me try to go in order:1) Opening space battle: despite losing the Death Stars to small fighters, and having fought the Rebellion for 30+ years, the First Orders commanders are utterly unprepared when a single fighter manages to sneak past their big canons and severly damage their biggest dreadnought. Snoke was apparently unaware his capital ship, that he is on, now has a device that can track the Rebel fleet through hyperspace. Apparently the Galaxy Far Far away does not bother with gravity and vacuum, as the Rebel bombers literally ""drop"" bombs ""down"" in space. And the only way to release said bombs is with a remote control, one that is easily dropped, lost, or fumbled. Poe made a prank call to open up the movie.... HILARIOUS right!??2) Plot : what, in the name of all that is holy, was the point of that IDIOTIC Finn/Asian chick side quest? Not only did the out of place Casino planet fee straight out of a James Bond movie and UTTERLY took me out of the film (tuxedos, dice, popular Earth gambling games, etc), the entire side quest was COMPLETELY POINTLESS and served no purpose other than to give the two minority characters something to do. And when the hell did Rose fall in love with Finn? In the in-universe few HOURS they were together? Also according to the #MeToo movement, isnt Rose kissing Finn while he was almost passed out now considered ""Sexual Assault""? Imagine if Finn did that to Rose? And if the whole quest was to get in contact with a super rare Code Breaker (too bad they don't have R2 D2), what are the chances they would just HAPPEN to be locked in with an equally competent code breaker just in time to escape together? 3) Excessive SJW/Feminist/Political correctness. If I walk into a room and theres me (middle eastern), an African American, an Asian, a Jew, and a gay person (all mixed genders), great! No problem. Its when its artificially shoved down our throats and forced that it becomes an issue. Rose has no reason for existing other that to have an Asian character and fill in the diversity quota. She adds exactly zero to the plot and her removal would make no difference what so ever. Admiral Holdo is, in the most ham fisted literal sense, the purple haired, physical manifestation of modern day toxic feminism. She literally has purple hair, and her entire purpose to is put the ""mansplaining"" hot shot Poe in his place and to show that, despite her being completely and utterly stupid and irrational by any standard, she really isn't at all, and that this proves that all women really are rational, even when they are not. And its just men keeping them down! Speaking of which, apparently all competent leaders in this new Star Wars are women, and all the bumbling, incompetent ones are white stuffy men.4) The ""hyperspace ram"" scene. Oh my god this single scene just made the entire Star Wars saga completely and utterly irrelevant:A New Hope: ""Sir, we just analyzed the Death Star plans and devised a risky assault plan....""Just hyperspace ram it""ESB: ""Sir, our troops are assembled and ready to commence the ground assault against the Rebel base....""""Just hyperspace ram the Shield Generator, then hyperspace ram the Rebel base""Return of the Jedi : ""Sir, the Death Star is just ahead and we are preparing our fleet to....""""Just hyperspace ram the Death Star""""But sir, its protected by an energy shield from the Forest Moon of Endor""""Hyperspace Ram the Shield generator, then hyperspace ram the Death Star""Rogue One: ""We have the Death Star plans, but we need to deactivate the shield in order to be able to transmit it to the....""""Just hyperspace ram the shields until they are.... actually we can just hyperspace ram the Death Star anyways. I guess we dont need those plans after all, ok guys lets go home""Besides directly making all of the above completely irrelevant, what happens in this new Disney Star Wars universe if a pilot falls asleep on the wheel and accidentally hyperspace rams a planet? What if he was checking his Twitter while piloting? or a disgruntled former employee? A terrorist?Speaking of the Death Stars too, why build such an expensive space station when you can just strap on a hyperdrive to random asteroid and hyperspace it into a planet? Much more cost effective and same exact effect, no?Finally, why did ""Admiral"" Holdo wait until the very LAST REBEL ship to hyperspace ram the Capital ship of the New Order? She sacrificed like, what, a dozen Rebel ships before she apparently came up with that brilliant idea? I'm guessing the purple hair dye seeped into her brain, or maybe it was just the patriarchy holding her down. Who knows?5) Luke Skywalker. Now here is a man, who, at the tender young age of his early 20s, was plucked out of obscurity from a remote desert planet, and, despite everyone and their mothers telling him otherwise, decides that Darth Vader, the notorious mass murderer and the Emperor's right hand man, had some good in him, and he bravely went and confronted him not once, but TWICE. Where is this hero? Apparently broken and defeated because a barrel chested angsty teenager got a little mad at him, forcing him to abandon his friends, family, and all he has ever fought for and sulk like a coward milking some kind of space cows. Fruthermore, whats the point of the ghost projection at the end if he was going to die anyways? Why not go there as a man worthy of the Luke Skywalker legend? I have no problem with characters changing, thats fine. Its how the story teller TAKES that character there is what counts. To take someone like Luke and have him turn into a sulking coward, you have to EARN the right to that to him by exceptional story telling. 6) Rey ""Mary Sue"". Please keep in mind that in the in-universe timeline, Mary Sue was, at best, a week removed from her escape from Jakku. In that short amount of time, somehow she manages to 1) defeat Luke skywalker in an impromptu melee, 2) Defeat Snoke's Elite bodyguards in a grossly over matched setting, 3) use the Force competently enough to defeat Kylo Ren, who has presumably been training since childhood, 4) and outfly trained TIE Fighter pilots, among many other super human feats. 5) Know how to swim.... after living her entire life on a desert planet. Anakin Skywalker, who was ""too old"" at 9 years old to even begin training, must be jealous. Luke, the son of the prodigal Anakin Skywalker, had to struggle to even move a lightsaber and spent months on a swamp planet with a dyslexic talking frog just to learn the basics of the Force, and got his hand chopped off for his efforts.7) The entire plot revolves around the FO fleet slowwwwly crawl up to the escaping Resistance fleet. First of all, why does light (laser beams) ""lose power"" over the distance of a few kilometers in vacuum? And since when do Star Wars ships ""use fuel"" when in the still canonical cross section books even the oldest Republic Era capital ships were powered by ""massive fusion generators that generate more power than a star""? Just to serve a contrived and boring plot point and give a movie something to make it last 2 hours? Did the Death Star have to stop by a gigantic Chevron gas station in space on its way to blow up Alderaan? Hopefully Tarkin let the Stormtroopers use the bathrooms and grab some snacks real quick. Is Pablo Hidalgo still around to make sure consistency in the SW canon is maintained? Or is it now the ""Kathleen Kennedy **** show""?8) The entire Resistance is apparently comprised of a few hundred people. For an entire galaxy of quintillion beings. Apparently the Resistance capital ships have a population density less than that of your average crack house. Just how 12 is Rian Johnson exactly? And why is the only way to send a message to their allies on that old Rebel base? no one has an iphone? They managed to contact Maz just fine before.8 ) Snoke.... why kill off the single most interesting new bad guy? Space Leia... why? The third leg on those Rebel speeds on the planet Crayt that create a very visually distinct red trail easily trackable by the enemy....why? The resistance keeping the base door open until the last second causing needless casualties....why? How did that Code breaker even know of the Rebel plans? Finn and Rose left before anyone even knew what the plans even were. Who told him? Who told Finn/ Rose? Speaking of the Dynamic Diversity Duo, how did they manage to make it back to the Rebel base on Crayt so quickly, without getting shot at by the AT-AT walkers, once their speeders crashed? DOES THIS MOVIE EVEN STAY CONSISTENT TO ITS OWN SELF?The entire existence of this movie, which removed any and all interesting characters and mysteries (Snoke, Reys parents, Luke, etc) introduced in Force Awakens. Why? What about the Knights of Ren, CLEARLY shown in the Force Awakens as being part of the destruction of Lukes Jedi Academy? The level of carelessness in constructing a coherent, consistent trilogy is astounding. I would not be surprised in the slightest if I found out Rian Johnson never even watched the Force Awakens, or at best was given a rough outline of what happened in it.In short.... congratulations Universe. You win again.Not just the worst Star Wars movie ever, but honestly just one of the worst movies in general.Rian Johnson is just an edgy douche bag who clearly enjoys taking what he knows people like and expect and just going the complete opposite way just to be a contrarian jack ass, If that's all Disney wanted they could have just made Luke Skywalker be the leader of a group of space faring Force using Unicorns who are the reincarnated Jedi masters of the past and shoot lasers out of their horns. Even less people would have expected that so it HAS to be good, right?Kathleen Kennedy is a well know hardcore feminist idiot. Now that old white dude Lucas is not the boss anymore, Kathleen is having a field day shoving her toxic neo-feminist garbage down our throats.Please don't support this film. Don't support Disney. They are the epitome of a soulless corporation that specializes in mass producing generic, unimaginative digital content and overcrowded, overpriced theme parts. They need to learn their lesson and not be the arrogant corporation they are, and go back to their roots. RT is not calculating the REAL scores of this film correctly. Its audience approval is WAY less than 49%, and the fake ""five star"" reviews are barely one or two sentences long. All the professional critics paid off or intimated by Disney are now exposed and will lose a TON of credibility in their future reviews.This is just a MESS. It takes a special kind of idiot to be able to ruin an established franchise like Star Wars in such a way, and Rian Johnson is exactly that idiot.","The Last Jedi",287,4.1,3.1
"288",2,"  While The Last Jedi took risks, it suffered because of them. The Finn and Rose Arc was unnecessary and a waste of time. Making Luke wait 2/3 of the way through the movie to accept his call to action is a waste of his and ultimately Rey's Character progression. The movie is a good generic Sci-fi film but not a great entry in the Star Wars Saga. A waste of Mark Hamill's talent and a waste of Luke as the character we knew him as. While The movie has it's merits, it has too much slap stick comedy and plotholes that make it unsuccessful. 30 mins too long, this movie misses the mark after 2 successful entries by Disney. The future looks bleak for Star Wars.","The Last Jedi",288,4.1,2.1
"289",0.5,"  This movie ruined my childhood memories by polluting it with a terrible 'I don't care attitude.' The SJW messages throughout the terrible plot and poor character development. I'm so disenchanted with the way the franchise is going.","The Last Jedi",289,4.1,3.6
"290",0.5,"  this movie was a disappointment to the star wars legacy.","The Last Jedi",290,4.1,3.6
"291",1,"  The film is a middle finger to the audience. When I was walking out the cinema I remember thinking did the director and writer even see the previous film or any other star wars film. All through the film it was constantly preaching political messages getting in the way of the story, although the George Lucas films did have this at times, but it was very subtle. It basically treats the audience like they are idiots. So many poor characters written badly to be honest I feel sorry for the actors in the film because I feel they were made to look like fools. Once again they ripped off the original trilogy episodes 5 and 6, so extra marks for originality (sarcasm). I feel I could go on much longer put trying to keep this short so I will simply say this worst stars film EVER, yes, worse than Phantom Menace. In fact watching how poor this film is it makes me appreciate the episodes 1-6 even more and I will not be going to see episode 9 unless drastic change in 'Disney Star Wars'.","The Last Jedi",291,4.1,3.1
"292",1.5,"  Putting all the political nonsense in the movie aside, it just wasn't a good story. There were some outstanding backdrops and sets in this movie, that is the only reason I even gave it 1.5 stars. The Tomatometer gives this movie a 91%. My only guess is those reviews are coming from people trying to keep their jobs. I still am looking forward to more Star Wars content, but only from creators like Dave Feloni.","The Last Jedi",292,4.1,2.6

"295",0.5,"  I'm so sad. Don't Get Me Wrong, I'm a fan of Star Wars. But this is... not Star WARS. The people who made this movie obviously have a grudge against Star Wars at large, and what was set in the (not-that-good) Force Awaken. We want Star Wars, not Director's Visions WARS.","The Last Jedi",295,4.1,3.6
"296",0.5,"  This movie doesn't follow the other movies. I couldn't believe that they took everything that they setup from the last movie and just threw it out the window. This movie did not leave me wanting more. Disney you jumped the shark with this one.","The Last Jedi",296,4.1,3.6
"297",0.5,"  Horrible Movie. Even The Prequels were way better than this. Anakin's "" I don't like sand "" was way better than Luke's murder attempt. This movie destroyed the Luke Skywalker character. I wish this movie never existed.","The Last Jedi",297,4.1,3.6

"300",0.5,"  I was thoroughly looking forward to The Last Jedi, but was severely disappointed with the direction of the film.1) There was so much build up for Snoke, but he turned out to be so easily beaten and there was no explanation about his origins.2) Holdo was a poor excuse for a leader - she could have easily explained to Poe why she made the decisions she did instead of creating mistrust amongst her crew.3) Rose Tico was a poor character - no real character development.4) Luke Skywalker was painted out to be such a weak character, even going so far as to wanting to kill his own nephew in his sleep. This doesn't sound like the Luke Skywalker we knew from the previous 3 movies.5) Leia had the ability to execute an unexplained force power without any training at all.6) The casino planet seemed completely unrelated and did not fit into the flow of the movie.7) Rey stsated that she already knew where she was from, and yet, was being called by Luke's lightsaber and the Jedi tree, which didn't really explain anything.I would strongly recommend against seeing this movie.","The Last Jedi",300,4.1,3.6
"301",0.5,"  The movie sucked....period","The Last Jedi",301,4.1,3.6
"302",1,"  This movie has a terrible plot and childish characters. The SWU has lost a huge opportunity to expand its universe and damaged itself so hard that I am in doubt about the future of this franchise, unless this movie is rebooted. Besides the cosmopolitan environment. I didn`t care if the characters were a strong woman or not, or its ethnicity. The characters are just bad as does the plot. I`ve left the theaters completely sad and won`t be watching anything on it until I see severe changes on this franchise.","The Last Jedi",302,4.1,3.1
"303",0.5,"  Bad Decisions, Worst Movie Ever of SW","The Last Jedi",303,4.1,3.6
"304",1.5,"  The bottom line is I did not like the movie at all. Yes, I saw the original trilogy as a kid and yes I had high expectations for the movie to be good. First, I felt the plot was not that great. All that build up for Luke to get his light saber back and then he threw it told me this was not going to be good. The bad jokes, the slow space chase of the Resistance from the First Order, the uselessness of all the new characters, the Disney toy plug with the meaninglessness of the Casino planet adventure, Leia blasted into space, making Finn and Poe look stupid versus every female character, cowardly Luke, leaving Snoke an empty character and poor man's Hoth battle with just a handful of the Resistance left made for a long disappointing story. I don't know if JJ Abrams can fix thus with Episode 9 but I have no interest in Rian Johnson's trilogy because I think he did a poor job of trying to open up the Star Wars saga to a new audience by insulting the loyal fans that go back to the 1970's with a poorly written and directed movie that went against George Lucas vision. I have no ill will. I just don't have any interest in Rian Johnson's vision.","The Last Jedi",304,4.1,2.6
"305",1,"  This review contains plot spoilers. The Last Jedi is a terrible movie. It features a disjointed and illogical plot, and destroys the central character of the entire saga. The film opens with the First Order engaged in a space battle with The Resistance. The heroes are stymied because somehow the bad guys can track their hyper space jumps, and therefore appear within moments after the good guys have thought that they made it to a safe location. Down to just enough fuel for one last jump the heroes lead a slow speed chase through space with the First Order in pursuit. Yet why does the First Order pursue them? They could simply jump through hyperspace to locations in front, to the sides, below and above them. They would be hemmed in, and quickly destroyed. This type of illogical storytelling is the very essence of The Last Jedi: the movie tells the audience something half baked, and expects them to go along blindly. Finn is once again portrayed as a selfish coward who will cut and run at the first sign of danger. He is caught in the act of escaping by Rose who threatens to have him imprisoned for desertion. Is that something that the resistance does? I was under the impression that the rebels in Star Wars were there because they wanted to be there. No one threatened to imprison Han Solo when he collected his reward, and left the rebellion in the lurch in A New Hope. Seems like a First Order thing, but who cares? Logic is optional.  Finally at the end of the movie Finn sees that there are causes worth dying for as the First Order takes aim at the last refuge of the heroes with a mini Death Star weapon that will rip their fortress open, and be the end of all organized rebellion to the evil in the galaxy. He aims his ship at this weapon preparing to sacrifice himself to save the future. And then Rose rams him out of the way in an incredibly selfish act that she claims is to save those she loves. What about all of the people in the fortress that are now doomed? And where will she and Finn escape to now that she has destroyed both of their vehicles, and allowed the First Order to destroy their only safe haven? Not great at the long term thought, Rose. Again pesky logic makes this movie difficult to enjoy The treatment of Luke Skywalker is an abomination, and insult to every true Star Wars fan. Luke admits that he crept into Ben Solo's room to read his mind as he slept in order to ascertain if he was turning to the dark side. This nocturnal espionage yields compelling evidence that the young man is indeed headed down the dark path. At this point Luke momentarily decides that the best course of action is to murder his nephew in cold blood. He quickly thinks better of this course, but not before the younger Solo wakes to see Uncle Luke standing over him with a light saber in his hand, and a murderous glint in his eye. This causes the youngster to attack Luke and kill his loyal Jedi apprentices. In The Return of the Jedi a much younger Luke surrenders to Darth Vader, because he believes that, in spite of all of the atrocities his father has committed, there is still good in him. At one point in his confrontation with Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine Luke loses control and viciously attacks his father, because Darth Vader discovers the existence of Leia by reading Luke's mind. After Luke cuts off his father's mechanical hand he comes back to himself, and throws his light saber aside. This nonresistant tactic ends up causing Vader to truly have a change of heart. Now we are supposed to believe that Luke Skywalker is a cold blooded murder. He doesn't attempt to talk to Ben. He just thinks of killing him. Luke would never do that. Not even momentarily. That is not Luke Skywalker. And this movie is not Star Wars. It's an ill conceived cash grab that assumes that Star Wars fans are morons that spout billions of dollars for zippy laser shows. It's calculated and manipulative trash.","The Last Jedi",305,4.1,3.1
"306",2.5,"  Personal i don't think its amazing nor is it terrible. One of the largest draw backs is it supporting cast, especially the new additions to the movie. Another problem is the creative tone changed due to the change of direct, this is very apparent in the first scene which continues on from the end of the previous movie. over all still a better film than 'The Force Awakens'.","The Last Jedi",306,4.1,1.6
"307",1,"  What a piece of crap. Saw it a few times, it keeps getting worse. Should have hired silent Bob. Watch his reweiw on youtube. Kathleen Kennedy i hate you. I can't believe how bad this movie is and what they did to the legend of Luke Skywalker. I think Disney should fire these idiots and say just kidding and start over","The Last Jedi",307,4.1,3.1
"308",0.5,"  Just call it what it is, a Guardians of the Galaxy ripoff..","The Last Jedi",308,4.1,3.6
"309",1.5,"  Probably one if the least faithful to the series movies. This does not necessarily mean it's bad, however I dont believe that something needs to be changed wl unless you're going to do it better than the originals.I felt the movie never struck the right balance between silly in a childish way, action and excitement. The pacing was frankly kind of weird (see the addition of fuel into the saga so they could have a very slow chase), during which Poe and Rose go to a casino planet so they can deepen their relationship from non-existant to two dimensional while tacking in some pretty hollow moral values.The Luke character come out of retirement to drink some bird milk (seriously) and anguish over some pretty weak moral dilemmas. I wish i could give it credit for a fresh and invigorating take on the existing series but the storyline was weak, the plot devices contrived and the acting was frankly not as good as 7, which I'll put back into the poor dialogue and almost slap stick level of childish comedy.Overall a very poor movie.","The Last Jedi",309,4.1,2.6
"310",0.5,"  Would give zero stars if I could. Worst star wars movie by far. Rose < Jar Jar.","The Last Jedi",310,4.1,3.6
"311",0.5,"  Avoided spoilers and Theories as much as possible coming in to this movie. No reviews, nothing to shape my expectations except 1 trailer. I was stunned on how bad the writing was and at certain points I just stared at the screen in disbelief. Only reason I watched the whole movie was because I hope it would do a Rogue One and get awesome in the end but sadly it just wrecked the ENTIRE STAR WARS UNIVERSE EVEN MORE!! Only reason people can delude themselves in to this being a good movie is because of the huge budget this movie had. If you just downgrade the music and visuals a tiny notch people would start hating this movie instead of get blinded by it.","The Last Jedi",311,4.1,3.6
"312",0.5,"  Terrible, what a waste of a great franchise","The Last Jedi",312,4.1,3.6
"313",0.5,"  Terrible writing, terrible character development, terrible in every area.... But oh it looks pretty and Ray is female so it's amazing.","The Last Jedi",313,4.1,3.6
"314",1,"  With questionable story decisions that seem to reboot and/or just wipe clean all 7 previous episodes for the sake of subverting expectations but without delivering anything satisfying instead, there was very little for me to enjoy here. With plot threads setup by Force Awakens (2015) cut short and with no explanations to how the universe is in its current state after the of Civil War. The story leads nowhere, starting with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys, and ending with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys. It fails to treat the original cast of the OT respectfuly, and fails to provide the characters setup by Abrams 2 years prior with any meaningful development. Duplicating scenes from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" almost frame by frame, it feels short out of ideas. A lot of the characters come across a very incompetent, and many are misused or almost ignored entirely. The movie's tone is all over the place, with some scenes struggling to make sure if they wanna make you feel sad and anxious for the heroes, or laughing as if this was a light hearted comedy. More power to those who love the movie. to me, it wasn't an enjoyable film, even with very low expectations.","The Last Jedi",314,4.1,3.1
"315",5,NA,"The Last Jedi",315,4.1,-0.9
"316",5,"  Can't quite fathom why so many people have had such a negative reaction to this wonderful movie!? I've been a huge SW fan since the 80s. The Last Jedi was beautifully shot and directed - with an obvious love and respect for the Original Trilogy. The slapstick humor is sometimes a bit much, but seriously people - IT'S A MOVIE - it's ok to have a laugh. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is amazing.","The Last Jedi",316,4.1,-0.9
"317",0.5,"  Where to begin with this movie. Others have already covered it's flaws, and what it's strengths were. Fundamentally this just wasn't well paced, the humor was misplaced and the movie is filled with glaring plot holes, where all reason is ignored as well as the rest of the franchise in order to ""Reboot Star Wars"" in the middle of a trilogy, creating a mess of a movie.","The Last Jedi",317,4.1,3.6
"318",0.5,"  I didn't believe it will be that bad, but it was. Bad, illogical plot, ridiculous space battle logic, stupid choices by main characters. Probably the worst Star Wars and a very bad SciFi movie.","The Last Jedi",318,4.1,3.6
"319",0.5,"  Heart breaking in ever single way.","The Last Jedi",319,4.1,3.6
"320",1.5,"  Kind of a turd. Was so bad it systematically made the Force Awakens worse, made the 3rd movie virtually limp in hype, and secured its own pkace next to the Phantom Menace in most disliked Star Wars movies. A mess of characters and storylines that meander, insult older fans, and ultimately amount to nothing in the grander Star Wars stort. A snarky dismantling of what you enjoy about Star Wars in the first place. Rian Johnson may be a capable director, but as a writer, as a Star Wars curator, he's a smoking disaster. Keep him far far away from any further Star Wars decisions. This movie was prequel atmosphere 2.0.","The Last Jedi",320,4.1,2.6
"321",1,"  Terrible movie, where do I begin. Luke Skywalker story arc is just laughable, this is the guy who wouldn't give up on his father and refused to believe he was all bad and wanted to turn him from the dark side, yet when when faced with the same dilemma with Kylo Ren (his nephew) he decides instead to hide away in an island to milk some alien cows?. The humour is misplaced and isn't funny, that opening scene with Poe Dameron in his X-wing joking with the commander of the imperial fleet is very much cringeworthy and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Also PLEASE someone explain just why Kylo Ren is so dark-side obsessed? Anakin at least had a reason and was an awesome villain. Kylo just seems like a 13-year-old who got his black eyeliner taken away. What a lack of respect for the Star Wars universe. Leia flying in space was so bad. And BB8 driving was stupid. Snoke was the only good character but then he was killed. It was two and a half hours of pure Bantha poodoo and I'm being polite. Star Wars is dead.","The Last Jedi",321,4.1,3.1
"322",2.5,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a very disappointing film. It feels poorly written and badly paced. It also feels like a film made by someone who knows little about the Star Wars franchise, and enjoys even less about it.","The Last Jedi",322,4.1,1.6
"323",0.5,"  If you watch this just on the surface it might not be that great but if you look deeper pay attention to all the little nods and winks and pick up on all the mind games this movie is great.","The Last Jedi",323,4.1,3.6

"325",0.5,"  Truly horrible movie. I am not a fanboy but like the Star Wars movies. This movie is not made well. Story, pacing, writing is all truly bad. The sets and effects don't even look that good. I don't understand what happened.","The Last Jedi",325,4.1,3.6
"326",0.5,"  Rian Johnson ruined the franchise enough said!","The Last Jedi",326,4.1,3.6
"327",1,"  Definitely not for any true star wars fan, while it has interesting ideas, the failure in execution by Johnson dooms the movie. An entire sub-plot that seems forced and out if place, slows an already long movie. The time lines is off, and so many plot holes you'll break and ankle trying to avoid them. And of you were ever a fan of Luke Skywalker and his legacy, then this is a movie you should avoid.","The Last Jedi",327,4.1,3.1
"328",1,"  It is pretty bad as expected. Disney is to blame for it. Their agenda is obvious and it is something people and movie fans across the world have to fight against or very soon we will be forced to watch gay ballet dancers 24/7","The Last Jedi",328,4.1,3.1
"329",1.5,"  good visuals, bad story, a lot of miss opportunities. Jokes on scenes that should be serious and a really bad secondary plot that drags the movie to a halt. As a movie by its own stands as a pretty movie but as a sequel fails horrible.","The Last Jedi",329,4.1,2.6
"330",0.5,"  I've always been a huge star wars fan but I HATED this movie!","The Last Jedi",330,4.1,3.6
"331",0.5,"  I am a star wars fan. Growing up on the farm, we had two movies that i remember; Empire and Aliens. On sundays we would watch STO on the one local channel we could catch. This is my oldest love. I really want to love this film, i would love nothing more. I have watched it four times now, more painful each time, maybe just a little more numb to it. Johnson has made a beautiful film, no question. With gaping porn hole plot holes, near non existent character development and stunted undeveloped dialogue. Johnson made a pretty film, but it isn't a star wars film. This pile of steamy wonderment exists to needlessly kill off and demonize proven heroes and villians, derail a story that had some real prospects for the sake of a political agenda. This is the first time for me where watching a sequel has actually made me question the validity of the previous film. To a point where i loved Force awakens and now, upon realizing anything and anyone in the first film i cared about doesn't matter, I've never had a sequel make me end up hating both films, when i felt the opposite for the first. I didn't even know that was possible. Not a star wars film.","The Last Jedi",331,4.1,3.6
"332",0.5,"  the resurrection of Star Wars comes to a screeching halt. It resembled Space Balls more than anything else. The dated humor and lack of any depth left me with a strong sense of disgust. The addition on Rose dilutes the film even more. Her stale sarcasm screams of utter childish indulgence. Moreover, it begs the question..... why did they need to introduce a new character? Actually why even ask questions. This movie should have just never happened.","The Last Jedi",332,4.1,3.6
"333",2,"  A horrible attempt at making a Star Wars film as a whole. The director actually made it seem like he hated everything Star Wars was about before on a personal level and purposely sought out to make a movie that insulted all of the previous installments of the franchise. Save your money on this one. It's not even worth Redbox honestly.","The Last Jedi",333,4.1,2.1
"334",0.5,"  This is BY FAR the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It DISHONORS the saga's rich legacy while adding absurd characters and story lines. This never felt like a Star Wars movie and was just a giant troll on the fan base. Yeah, it looked beautiful but the novice writing and horrendous attempts at humor just completely ruined this film. I will no longer be spending my money on any Star Wars movies Disney produces. Period. They don't and never respected the source material and it shows, so why would I support their abominations of my beloved saga. Done and done.","The Last Jedi",334,4.1,3.6
"335",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie by a very wide margin. It is quite possibly the poorest written film to hit theaters in the past decade. But what makes this movie an absolute disgrace, is Rian Johnson's assassination attempt on the character of Luke Skywalker.","The Last Jedi",335,4.1,3.6
"336",0.5,"  This movie should of been called Star Wars gets ruined by an idiot director.","The Last Jedi",336,4.1,3.6
"337",0.5,"  Terrible film. Zero story telling or world building, and instead is littered with social justice warrior political messaging. Men are completely emasculated during the entire film, way too much forced humor, and Rose is worse than Jar Jar. And the treatment pf Luke's character is downright criminal. Flatliners was a better film than this. 0/10","The Last Jedi",337,4.1,3.6
"338",2,"  This movie is, and i say this with all sincerity, an absolute slap in the face to long time Star Wars fans. Horrible writing, horrible plot, bland characters, and the complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker. It feels like a blatant and purposeful execution of all things from the original Lucas made films. It seems incredibly mean spirited and deliberate. Don't waste your time on this one.","The Last Jedi",338,4.1,2.1
"339",1,"  So many missed opportunities to make a good movie. Carrie Poppins, slow space chase, the entire Canto Bight scene and the overall lack of character development really left me frustrated. Most importantly is the terrible development of Luke Skywalker. So frustrating.","The Last Jedi",339,4.1,3.1
"340",0.5,"  What can be said about this atrocity of a movie that has not already been stated? For me, the saga ends with The Force Awakens. I'm going to pretend that the last jedi & all future Star Wars movies do not exist. JJA, RJ & KK can go whatever direction they want with this property, but I won't be along for the ride. I choose to keep my childhood heroes in their previous, ulaltered state.","The Last Jedi",340,4.1,3.6
"341",1,"  The last Jedi was a poorly written mess. It reminded me of the walking dead in that all the drama and tension is achieved because characters don't talk to each other and it seems like they actively avoid simple conversations that would completely fix or end the movie. The story literally does not move forward at all from the end of the force awakens. I really wanted to love this movie, but someone could skip this movie and only need a short star wars opening crawl to catch up: Luke dies because he used the force to hard, Snoke was killed by Kylo because reason, and the rebels and first order are exactly where they were at the end of force awakens except now the first order is run by Kylo who I'm not even sure is a bad guy anymore or what his motivation even is. Oh and Rey is a nobody but can do whatever the plot needs her to do because plot armor.","The Last Jedi",341,4.1,3.1
"342",1,"  The Last Jedi was one of the worst Star Wars movies I've seen in a long time not since Episode 1 has one been this lame. . It left people feeling like the whole order of the original premise of the Jedi was highjacked along with the Star Wars saga, by people with leftists political agendas currently happening in these United States. Removing the role of men and manhood and replacing it with a more feminine and transgender influence. What a joke. Star wars and movies in general were at once a place for escape for movie goers from the real word so to speak. Luke Skywalker's character was the most disappointing for a Star wars fan. I may never again go to see Star Wars even if there is another made. I choose now to remain forever as thinking that Star Wars ended with the Return of the Jedi, as the last seen clearly shows. Thanks alot Disney you can kiss your true Star Wars fans goodbye. Word of advise. Don't bother making any more and go back to cartoons.","The Last Jedi",342,4.1,3.1
"343",0.5,"  This Is complete garbage, no script, no characters, no Star Wars just another shallow movie from scifi channel, Even worst, those movies are funny at least, and a movie, not this shit.","The Last Jedi",343,4.1,3.6
"344",2,"  OMG there is SO much wrong with this movie where to begin?","The Last Jedi",344,4.1,2.1
"345",4,"  While it does have pacing issues and one noticeably unnecessary subplot, The Last Jedi is a strong, complex entry in the Star Wars franchise that successfully develops its layered characters, both new and old, without sacrificing its exhilarating action. All while bringing along a few surprising and effective twists.","The Last Jedi",345,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"346",0.5,"  Long and boring, no substance what so ever. A few nice action scenes mixed in between the long pointless dialogue.","The Last Jedi",346,4.1,3.6
"347",1.5,"  While the Last Jedi was visually stunning, the plot was jumbled up and confusing. There were too many characters and story lines transitioning throughout. Holdo was useless, Admiral Akbar should have been the one in her place. Why are the male CHARACTERS PORTRAYED as helpless, diminished individuals? I couldn't help but feel as though the female leads were CONSTANTLY being shoved down my throat as the main 'Heroes', From Rey, to Rose, Rose's sister, Holdo and even Leia using the force randomly was terrible. I was DISAPPOINTED that the female characters were forced for political agenda. The only scene I enjoyed was the Praetorian Guards vs Rey and Kylo. Other than that I walked out of the THEATRE DISAPPOINTED, not because of debunked fan theories or because I feel ""threatened by women"" or because the main lead of the film is a female, but because it was a poorly written film which was too long with a storyline devoted to pointless casino scenes (which looked amazing, but the plot... not so much). The characters were dwindled down rather than progressing forward. Rey and Kylo have returned to square one plus Rose and Finn have a forced romance. In my opinion, Luke was out of character. You mean he would throw away a lightsaber of his fathers!? Which represents His Jedi lineage? Luke would never kill his nephew in his sleep! The same Luke who brought Vader, A man who committed mass genocide back to the light? With Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford out of this trilogy, It leaves me questioning how J.J is going to conclude it in one film.","The Last Jedi",347,4.1,2.6

"351",1,"  I left the theater confused, trying to search my feelings about the movie I just watched. Now, four months later, I can say I feel disappointed. Lack of plot continuity from TFA, Luke becomes a loser not capable of defeating a force apprentice. The first order are a bunch of morons whom you can prank anytime via speaker. The supreme leader is another loser who can't feel the force and we are presented with super boring non interesting characters like Rose and Holdo. I did liked TFA. Way to ruin ruin the franchise Disney. not spending a single penny ever on anything Star Wars related.","The Last Jedi",351,4.1,3.1
"352",2,"  Yeah...I didn't even bother going to the theater to watch this one. I knew it was going to be ""high budget bad"" I just didn't realize how bad. The special effects, as always, are awesome. But the plot continues to rot, and the characters...I'll have no choice but to add a spoiler here. My Luke Skywalker was willing to die to save his dad. This generation's Luke? In a moment of weakens wants to freaking murder his nephew?","The Last Jedi",352,4.1,2.1

"355",0.5,"  It feels like Disney/Lucas Film are actively trying to destroy this franchise. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and after seeing this movie, I doubt I will ever see another Star Wars movie in the theater again. This is a terrible movie and an embarrassing end to heroic characters that we have got to know over the last 40 years.","The Last Jedi",355,4.1,3.6
"356",1,"  I can't even begin to write my disgust for this creation. Enough to make me drink heavily.. I saw it opening night.

"360",2,"  This film is hot garbage juice. Pretty hot garbage juice, but garbage juice nonetheless. Nonsensical character arcs, pointless characters, pointless story-crushing ""twists"" and a truly short-sighted view to the franchise by the director/writers pushed purely to help push an agenda. 1 star for the visuals, 1 star for the truly fantastic performance from some of the actors in the face of their terrible script.","The Last Jedi",360,4.1,2.1
"361",1,"  Star Wars, The Last Jedi marks the first time in my life where I've walked out of a movie theater angry at the movie I just watched. It's a steaming pile of SJW garbage shoveled right in your face at nearly every turn.","The Last Jedi",361,4.1,3.1

"365",1,"  Seriously a 2 hour car chase to make no progress in the story of the trilogy.","The Last Jedi",365,4.1,3.1
"366",1,"  I disliked most everything about this movie. The story is poor to say the least and littered with plot holes. The First Order reigns supreme with no discussion why even despite just losing Starkiller Base. It's leadership is nothing more than blundering buffoons and frankly the Resistance is about the same. Luke Skywalker was reduced to a moron and was easily beaten by Rey in a stupid stick battle. Got to see Yoda! Overall shame for the franchise.","The Last Jedi",366,4.1,3.1
"367",2,"  As much as I liked some parts of this movie. I have to say this is the biggest piece of junk in the ST universe. With junk like this movie I cannot wait for George Lucas to write and produce a new generation of Sci-Fi movies. Perhaps on another Galaxy","The Last Jedi",367,4.1,2.1
"368",1,"  Been a long time SW fan, love TFA and R1. Was so excited for this movie felt like Xmas going to the cinema to watch this. I remember leaving feeling empty, kind of in shock and tried to justify it, after the second viewing I genuinely hate this movie. It's not just this movie but the direction Lucasfilm is going with Kennedy at the top, we need a SW fan running things not someone who is going to push a political agenda on everyone. Kennedy is incompetent look at all the directors she has fired for example. I'm not giving Disney anymore money until they sort this mess at the top of Lucasfilm out and put someone in charge who cares about the franchise and all the fans. FYI I'm not a bot or Russian","The Last Jedi",368,4.1,3.1

"372",1,"  Killed star-wars for me. Ruined Luke, made the First Order into buffoons. If I wanted Team Rocket level antics from major villains, I'd just go watch Saturday morning cartoons. Theres a myriad of issues with the film just beyond that, but I'm not willing to write a 2,000 word essay on why I hate this. Theres more articulate reviews left concerning the problems with the film. In a word, its a string of scenes written before the story, and then plot contrivances connecting them, with little concern to the overall universe and existing characters.","The Last Jedi",372,4.1,3.1
"373",0.5,"  Huge star wars fan. I'm 40 years old so I've been there from the beginning. The nonsensical, goof-off, slapstick humor completely ruined it for me. It felt a lot like the prequels because of that. The tone of Rogue One was good and it's one of my favorite in the series. They need to try to stick to that tone. I don't know where Lucasfilm every got the idea that fans want comedy in Star Wars. Is it because Han Solo was sarcastic in the original trilogy and fans loved it? When the OT started to derail with the Ewoks, there was fan blow-back. It's crazy to me that Lucasfilm cannot recognize the correlation between poorly acted slapstick moments in Star Wars and fan criticism. Ep 4, 5, 6, 7 and Rogue One have the right formula.","The Last Jedi",373,4.1,3.6

"377",2,"  Space battles make no sense. Luke Skywalker's character makes no sense. General Hux and Kylo Ren act like two children leading an army (also no sense how they got promoted to that point). Don't get me started on Rose and Canto Bight. Oh, and Rey is still a mary sue.","The Last Jedi",377,4.1,2.1
"378",0.5,"  Everything I want to say about this movie has been said a thousand fold. Why this generation hates the original films, I have no idea. Because they can't be topped? For me Rogue One was on par with ROTJ as the 3rd best in the saga. Very close indeed. You CAN make a sequel to a classic of old without destroying it's legacy & still be a good film. Watch rogue one or blade runner 2049 or creed. All were good, paid homage to the classic movie it was a part of & didn't destroy it's legacy & alienate fans.Besides the obvious franchise killing decisions of this movie, where were the droids? Aliens from the sw universe? Force awakens didn't have them either. Twi'leks? Rodians? Saw twi'leks in rogue one. This movie was a joke & good luck getting people to see episode 9","The Last Jedi",378,4.1,3.6
"379",1.5,"  This motion picture had no plot or main character. Shameful.","The Last Jedi",379,4.1,2.6
"380",0.5,"  I loved the force awakens, I was really disappointed by this flick. There was so much more that could've been done with this movie I feel. Saw Too little of Snoke and Luke. We could have been given a little something of Snoke and Reys' backstory. It was teased and then never saw fruition. The whole trip to the casino planet seemed like a waste of time. We could've seen more of Luke or Rey doing something meaningful. What about Finns' backstory? We know nothing of him! Luke would have never have attacked a young Ben, and would have definitely left his planet. There was a lot missing from Leah's character as well. She obviously had some kind of training, but there was no mention of this at all. Rose was Underdeveloped and unneeded. What About Laura Derns' Character? Didn't like her character either. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they were women! Captain Phasma was awesome, but again, no character development and overwhelmingly unused. I see a trend of pushing Feminism and Staying away from the tried and true Star Wars formula","The Last Jedi",380,4.1,3.6
"381",1,"  It is not the worst movie ever made, but it is close. It is full of just jaw dropping moments of stupidity. Should be retitled as ""Spaceballs 2"" only not as funny.","The Last Jedi",381,4.1,3.1
"382",1,"  Easily the worst Star Wars movie. Terrible story and characters. A slap in the face to the fans and original characters.","The Last Jedi",382,4.1,3.1
"383",1,"  I'm giving it one star for the special effects. Not even the music can save this piece of garbage. We've heard it 8 times already. Complete disrespect to fans of the franchise and one of the worst attempts at ""filmmaking"" in history. Never have we seen someone try not only to destroy plot points from the previous movie in a trilogy but also do his best to make it as hard as possible for the next movie to follow up. An objectively bad movie both from the standpoint of fan service and entertainment. China appropriately phrased it as ""insulting to their intelligence"". Disney should focus on quality management instead of calling those who dislike the movie ""sexists"".","The Last Jedi",383,4.1,3.1
"384",1.5,"  This movie is not Star Wars anymore. 1 of my favorite things about star wars was there was ""NEVER"" any swear words. This movie either ruined star wars or its NOT STAR WARS ANYMORE upon breaking tradition. Now I'm not saying this movie isn't good, cause it is a Great movie, but just to me ""NOT STAR WARS""","The Last Jedi",384,4.1,2.6

"391",0.5,"  What a mess of a movie. Plot holes galore, poor characterization, a completely pointless casino planet side plot, and worst of all the treatment of Luke Skywalker. This will be the first Star Wars film I don't buy on blu ray. It goes against the grain for me to be so negative about my beloved Star Wars but this movie is bloody awful.","The Last Jedi",391,4.1,3.6
"392",2,"  Enjoyed the saber battle, Adam Drivers and Mark Hamill's acting skills but that was all. Very let down with the storytelling and the terrible characters. The force has become way too female and the story a mess.","The Last Jedi",392,4.1,2.1

"394",0.5,"  As a die hard star wars fan, I was very excited to see this movie. After watching the force awakens and waiting with anticipation for this one.

I am sorry but this does not feel like a star wars movie. Sad what Disney have done to it.","The Last Jedi",394,4.1,3.6
"395",0.5,"  Literally THE WORST Star Wars Movie I've EVER WATCHED. NOT due to lack of action, special effects or stupid Jar Jars... it FAILED miserable as it completely RUINED ALL of Star Wars mythology, Jedi force, the conflict of Sith and Jedi and made Luke Skywalker, my childhood hero a weak, old, useless past his time Jedi, NOTHING like how Obi One was portrayed! Similarly, while Luke had to get extensive Jedi training to be good at anything, and so was Anakin, Rey simply beat Kylo and Luke and others by just random forces! It's beyond pathetic! The whole going to the island was a waste of time, no training, no Jedi teachings, nothing! Stokes kill was pathetic, the whole Kylo Ren being a spoiled kid was weak, the SJW socialists non-sense was too much, Princess Leah somehow FLYING in the space back from explosion was stupid, dropping BOMB in the middle of space with no gravity, and WEAK unlikable characters were horrible and would NEVER generate any interest in the long run like the old movies did when I was a child. Also, the last scene was an EPIC FAILURE, it was a complete insult to all of Luke fans that he did NOT participate in an actual light sabre fight, and it was his ghost. It was literally icing on the cake! I watched Star Wars as a child and have followed it ever since like nothing else in my life and Disney, Hollywood Elite and SJW culture RUINED IT FOR ME... FOREVER. I will skip the last movie as there's literally no character worth watching is left on the franchise. I personally don't mind Rey, but they have butchered her character and her story is weak beyond belief! So, overall SKIP this one, or watch it when it comes to TV or Netflix, not worth the $20 at the movies... specially if you are a long-term fan of the original trilogy.","The Last Jedi",395,4.1,3.6
"396",0.5,"  Worst star wars ever, didn't go anywhere should have been a stand alone without any main people we know and love. How Iran Johnson and Disney can't understand how bad this movies is","The Last Jedi",396,4.1,3.6

"398",1,"  This is an honest opinion of The Last Jedi, it had great effects and some amazing fight scenes, but that is the only positive I have. Luke was a terrible character, not at all who he should have been. Rey is the biggest Mary Sue in the world, Kylo is whiny and a prick, we all know Kanto bite sucked ads Fin was useless Rose is an awful character. Walked away feeling super underwhelmed and upon a second viewing realize how much this movie sucks for me.","The Last Jedi",398,4.1,3.1
"399",5,"  This is one of the best Star Wars films ever made. It breaks the mold while staying true to George Lucas's world. Rian johnson is an outstanding filmmaker and writer. Adam Driver, Mark Hamil, Carrie Fischer, and Daisy Ridley are amazing. Everything about this film takes Star Wars to a new level and sets up a stage fire Star Wars to continue for generations to come. Don't listen to the 19 salty fanboys who are just angry we didn't get a repeat of the original saga and so they spend hours a day down voting the reviews of this film. Watch it.","The Last Jedi",399,4.1,-0.9
"400",0.5,"  So sad. I viewed this movie twice in the theater. Visually, it was beautiful, and had some fun sequences, but as a Star Wars film, it was so weak. J.J. set things up fairly well with The Force Awakens, only for Johnson to throw it all away to castrate the male characters, particularly Skywalker, while at the same time pushing these ""flawless"" female characters up to the fore to be politically correct. Rey is the same clueless girl we got in the Force Awakens with little development to her character. Finn had more development, willing to sacrifice himself for a cause he believes in, only to have some mechanic whose only purpose is to spout off some political message jump in and stop him. Poe is shown to be a complete over the top hot head here, which isn't a bad idea in and of itself, but the entire idea of withholding the escape plan was just unnecessary. Kylo still isn't an intimidating villain, and Snoke's death had no real weight to it. And finally, Luke Skywalker's character was just...disappointing. Mark Hamill delivered a good performance for what he had to work with, but considering murdering his own nephew after he had redeemed his father who had done countless terrible acts years before was just a joke. Lucasfilm needs to be brought under better management. They need a president who actually understands the franchise that is being worked on, rather than gearing everything toward targeting a demographic that was never really intended to be the sole focus of the series. There were always strong female characters in the series and in the other related media. Unless Lucasfilm changes management and gets a grip on things, you'd be better off enjoying the Lucas era Star Wars, and some of the books and comics from that period.","The Last Jedi",400,4.1,3.6
"401",1,"  While technically a visually impressive film, the plot requires you to turn your brain off and every single character who isn't Kylo Ren suffers from poor character development. It fails as entertainment and to be frank, I never want to see it again.","The Last Jedi",401,4.1,3.1
"402",1.5,"  I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan and I was bored by this movie. Sure, it didn't meet my expectations but that's not why I didn't like it.

"407",5,"  Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. Every prequel was the worst thing that ever happened and ruined their childhoods, Rogue One was too grim, The Force Awakens was too similar to the originals, Last Jedi was too different from the originals, a lot of people hate Return of the Jedi for having Ewoks and a second Death Star. Some of the internet hate this time around is stemming from the alt-right types that are mad that it stars a woman and a black man, but aside from that it's business as usual.If you'd like to see a Star Wars movie that adds to the mythos, defies expectations, surprises you as strongly as Empire Strikes Back did, gives Luke Skywalker a full story arc and upsets all the right people, this is the movie you've been waiting for.","The Last Jedi",407,4.1,-0.9

"412",0.5,"  There is so many things wrong with this movie they cannot be listed. Check out MauLer the youtube channel for an honest review of this dumpster fire. The worst part about this film, besides dismantling what it meant to be STAR WARS, is that people think there's bots and online trolls manipulating the rating. The movie is objectively terrible and has some of the worst characters ever invented, its honestly amazing how this film was shot and released.","The Last Jedi",412,4.1,3.6
"413",1.5,"  It was a good movie to just kill time my main issues is that the movie felt a lot like a marvel movie to me. another issue is that i did not understand how she got so far with no training but that will diffrent till i read why she is it was the laziest writing i have seen in a movie and kill the main villain and now there is no threat to the galaxy and then now that rey and kylo are the only ones left kind kills the story. just didn't feel like a star wars movie just feel disappointed in Disney and what they did to the series","The Last Jedi",413,4.1,2.6
"414",5,"  Full of action, adventure, great special effects and heart. This is one of the best additions to the Star Wars saga. The low ratings in the audience score category feel false based on everyone I know that saw it. Beware digital manipulation of the audience score.","The Last Jedi",414,4.1,-0.9
"415",0.5,"  Visually it is a pretty picture, though its horrible writing, plot that is missing in action, and its overall dismissal of all things Star Wars legendary, made this the first Star Wars movie I have only seen once, and it was hard to suffer through that opening night viewing. Clearly, Disney wants to take Star Wars in a different direction ... if you didn't watch or care for Star Wars before, you might like this film as it is completely different from the Star Wars of past. Though if you enjoyed and respected Star Wars of the past, this is a terrible experience and painful waste of time.","The Last Jedi",415,4.1,3.6

Here is a short list.1) Rey, although she may be a bit overpowered, I can look past that. Suspension of disbelief and all. She is a great character although the ""mirror of erised"" in the chamber of secrets scene tested that with me.2) Yoda schooling Luke. Even Masters have something to learn.3) Poe and the opening scene proving how great of a pilot he is. Everything after that in the scene is utter garbage. Nice slow moving bombers that get wiped out.4) Got to see a character that looks like Luke Skywalker on the screen. Does not act like Luke in any way. Even though he has been disenchanted, after years of exile, he would have decided to do something about it.There are a few other things.That being said...Those are FAR outweighed by the amount of canon destroying garbage that have been blended into this work. It has Star Wars THINGS in it, but it is NOT a work that positively contributes to the SW universe.Utter garbage. Here is the short list.1) Canto Blight. THE WHOLE THING. Especially broom ""boy"", but I will come back to that.2) DJ. Dumbest character ever.3) Maz Kanata's shoehorned ""appearance"". A VERY strong character wasted.4) Wasted Finn. Is he still FS?5) Holdo. Despicable character.Leia ""taught her everything she knew""? Really? Leia is a strong character that CARES about people and acts like it. Holdo cares about her authority and protects it instead of sharing what is going on. Waited until almost the ENTIRE flotilla of escape shuttles was wiped out before doing the ""Holdo Maneuver"". Really? What is up that that name? NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF SW EVER THOUGHT TO RAM ANOTHER SHIP WITH YOUR SHIP JUMPING INTO LIGHTSPEED?5) Ending the film with Broom ""boy"" using the Force to sweep the floor and looking into the sky.

The scenes are acted well for the most part but the scrip and plot are very week. The protagonist seems extremely powerful and important yet there seems to be no reason why. She meets one of the greatest characters in film history and he doesn't train her...she is already powerful and his actions make him unrecognizable to the hero we once new. This is the longest Star Wars movie AND has the least content, not much actually happened in this film yet...all the best characters a dead. By itself this is a bad film, being a Star Wars films, I would say it's the worse yet. I'd rather watch Battle for Endor.","The Last Jedi",431,4.1,3.6

At best, this decision is poor marketing; ignoring the fan base that made Star Wars as popular and iconic as it is, and at best, it's a spiked-bat being used to bludgeon politically-correct ideology down the throats of a public, unwilling to spend upwards of $100/family for the privilege of being preached to for 2.5 hours.

"437",2,"  It's not the worst Star Wars installment, but it is close. From the space-chase context that lasts less than 24 hours, to Luke's enological character arc and incongruence to TFA (why the heck was Lors on Jakku with the map? Why was R2 shutdown until the map was presented?), and his ultimate pointless suicide, to Rose's last minute crash, monologue, and cliched kiss, to the structurally unproductive Canto Bight tangent and the waste of characters like Admiral Akbar, Snoke, Luke, Leia, and DJ, to the introduction of new, flat characters (Hodo, DJ), the Last Jedi offers great examples of how not to write and execute a screenplay. It will be taught as such in MFA programs forevermore! It simply misses the mark in its storytelling and doesn't smoothly fit within the larger trilogy and cannon. All this movie had to accomplish was to create a chemistry between Luke and Rey (pass the torch), one that is mutually beneficial and coherent. It failed and all these other issues are exacerbated by that failure. You can like the movie, you can think its funny, or unique, you can like the characters too (I love the new characters), but you can't argue its good writing, by any rational measure.

"440",0.5,"  May the farce be with you...It's not the ""divisive"" choices taken with Luke's character. It's not the terrible sub-plots with Finn, Rose and Po. It's not the disregard or wasted potential of Snoke, Rey's parents, or Leia doing a Superman impression.It's the insultingly placed humour that undercuts the emotional impact of every. fucking. scene. I mean seriously. The opening with Hux and Po on loudspeaker is really funny... if it was the Lego adaptation?! Hux is a wasted character, seemed a bit off the hook Hitler style in 7, now he's just that really angry guy who provides comic relief. Oh wait, EVERY character in this film provides comic relief! Yay!... The jokes and gags weren't not funny, they were just so out of place and ultimately has ruined Star Wars. Wonderful. I love it when things become a parody of themselves.Yes, everything I listed in the first paragraph absolutely grinds my gears. I'm all for taking Star Wars in new directions, exploring more aspects of the force, new characters taking the story forward. But not when the aforementioned is executed in such a way that it pillages, burns and rapes the entire canon back catalogue.Can I believe Luke would act the way he does? No. However, if that's the way Rian Johnson wants to take the character, cool - but justify it to me. Make me actually believe Luke could take the path he did. Of course he could act out of character, but he was written in such a way that the only thing he had in common with Luke is that Mark Hamill played him...Here's my luke-warm response to Rians decisions:Fast foward to the end of TFA. The emotional weight and reward of finally seeing Luke, both Rey and Skywalker welling up as much as the John Williams score. Snap into TLJ, Rey gets the saber out again (wtf continuity rant for another time) and Luke just grimaces and throws it away like a comedy sketch? What the fuck?! The tone of this character is awful, there's just nothing in common with what we've seen previously. I must state again, I'm all for character development and seeing a new side, but this treatment was detrimental to not only everything that had come before, but to Luke as a standalone in the movie.I won't deliberate too long, can of worms and all... but the flashbacks of Luke and Kylo sleeping?Come on man, Luke could have felt Kylo's supposed conflicted feelings without physically waving over his head. The last time I checked, all Jedi (including Luke in early stages of force use) could sense presence and feelings from a distance. So now Luke is supposedly diminutive in his force sensing abilities compared to previous movies. Great. The whole entering Ben Solo's room at night then whipping out his big green is also fucked up. Luke is now a coward for going in Ben Solo's bedroom to attempt murder while he sleeps and his guard is down, then he's just a straight up pussy because he doesn't follow through (enter Kylo sith fit wake up routine).Rian could have done ANYTHING. But chose this? I cannot comprehend. Luke has seen a lot in the past, Dad Vader ring any bells? Guy who pretty much single handedly wiped out the Jedi. So if he sensed dark in Ben Solo, it would have been so much cooler if he faced up to him properly, fell out with Leia because he wanted to kill her son, Han stuck in the middle doing that shrugging thing like when the Ewoks come out of nowhere in ROTJ... there's some great family space opera shit right there! And because we have virtually no back story on the last 30 years, we're already robbed of emotional weight. Eurgh. I'm disgusted frankly.Swiftly moving on, now I've got the important shit out the way... Finn might as well have died in TFA. The one moment he had any purpose or gravitas, Rose (yawn) stops him from committing suicide. Great. What I wanna know is, how did Finn drag Rose all the way back from the first order front line into the abandoned Rebel base without getting shot down? Again, for another time...Rose is shocking. Po ""intless"" Dameron. Thanks.Leia Superman... so many things wrong with that, but bottom line she can't be in Episode 9. Now she's gonna have an expected but underwhelming death in that film. Great. But you killed Luke instead, even though Mark Hamill is still alive. Great.Anyway, I've gone off on one and missed out loads but hey!

Well, this film is no different. To be fair, there were some good scenes that were interesting and enjoyable to watch. However, there were just too many mistakes made in this film. Many of the dramatic and emotional moments fell flat while other elements of the story were rushed and left unexplained. Its obvious that the writer/director didn't like Luke Skywalker. It showed throughout the depiction of the character. In addition, it feels as if the saga was hijacked in order to provide fans with a way out to make way for a new and different story line. Its not that new story development are a bad thing, but it was too much too fast. The film simply took too many liberties for a story as loved and cherished as Star Wars.

"460",0.5,"  TFA had a duty to try to draw in new fans as well as please old ones, and it accomplished that duty fairly well. It setup some new characters for new fans to love and still did ok with the original characters. Harrison Ford would not have come back unless he was given a death scene, so he got his wish. Carrie was treated well and Mark was left out almost entirely but I wholeheartedly believe that JJ had planned on the next film (Ep 8) to be ""Luke's story"" and to make up for him having only 10 seconds of screen time in the first movie. He had setup some decent new characters that could have some amazing backstories explained later and character arcs. Rey was definitely a mary sue, but at least Finn was someone with a decent arc to his story. Poe was meant to be disposable but Isaac is just too likable. So we finally get to Episode 8 and we are dying after waiting 2 years to get payoff's to all the threads that JJ opened up with Snoke, the First Order, Rey-Finn-Poe and to see Luke get the story he deserved and we had waited decades to see. What do we get instead? We get a complete mess of a movie with plot holes that would be expected in a first-time director's indie film but not in the 8th film in one of the largest film franchises in cinema history. The movie starts out horrible with jokes that don't land, a huge plot hole dealing with how gravity works in space, and only gets way worse from there. Finn gets destroyed in this movie, despite being the only one of the 3 new characters with an interesting character arc. He's originally used just as another lame sight gag and joke that fails to land or be funny. Then he's almost treated like a coward, then he goes off on a side-plot with yet another new character, which was another huge mistake, and the movie then spend a painful amount of time dealing with their side-plot that makes no sense, isn't necessary, isn't wanted and wasn't even any good. According to the setup, the entirety of what's left of the Republic (which is odd since they were in complete power with peace in the galaxy for 30 years since the end of RotJ, yet just because the First Order destroyed 5 planets, the entire galaxy is now under heel of a much smaller military force than the Empire was? Yet, with what little the Republic/Rebellion has left running out of gas out in space, waiting to die, Finn and Rose have to spend time setting free a bunch of slave animals and would have failed entirely if not for BB-8 who is remarkably capable for a metal ball. Somehow, BB-8 became more baddass than Captain Phasma, which is another of the huge mistakes Rian makes in this joke of a movie that he somehow got away with. Every great character that JJ set up in the first installment of this trilogy was completely screwed over by Rian in TLJ. Poe looks like a cocky a-hole traitor, Finn is played for gags, gets tossed on a side quest, forced into a love interest after being denied the hero death that everyone else got to have. All the men are useless and all the women are making the decisions and doing all the ""right"" things. (along with BB-8) And I could spend hours on how this movie completely and fundamentally f's up Luke Skywalker. Decades in the making and Rian Johnson destroys him in just over 2 hours. Rian repeatedly, REPEATEDLY gave the middle finger to long-time fans of the series and the very people that have made it the huge money-maker that it is today. Luke, Leia, Admiral Akbar, etc were all completely screwed over, even the new characters were completely screwed, all the great new threads that JJ set up in TFA were just tossed away the same way Luke tosses Anakin's lightsaber over a cliff. How in the world this movie was ever greenlit and allowed to exist is beyond me. How the hell is managed to get 91% with critics just shows how corruptable that system obviously is. Even trying to stand on its own, this movie is horrible and full of plot holes, jokes that aren't funny and an entire side-plot that makes no sense and yet takes up nearly a third of the movie. And when placed into the context of being the middle movie of a new trilogy that also exists as part of a galaxy of films that already include two other trilogies, then this film is even weaker and falls even harder. I feel sorry for all the fans that Rian screwed over and shattered the hopes of with this laughable excuse for a film. I also feel sorry for Mark Hamill who was contractually obligated to film this crap and poor Carrie who we won't get to see again and have the ending she deserved. Kathleen Kenedy needs to be fired, Rian needs to keep his incompetent hands out of the Star Wars universe and poor JJ has a lot on his shoulders now to not only somehow fix all that Rian just f'd up, but somehow win back the fans that he flipped off in the process.

"465",1.5,"  What can I say to add to this conversation? Firstly I want to say that I didn't have any fan theories going into this film, so that argument against those who dislike the film is invalid in my case. I've watched it a few times now and have thought a lot about it. I am a fan of Star Wars, but not a fanboy (am a big time Trek fan), but I love the original trilogy and The Force Awakens, but this really was a disappointing movie. In an attempt to subvert the expectations of the audience the director manages to have no ""payoff"" from anything that was set up in The Force Awakens, or for things that were set up in THIS movie. You read that right. This movie doesn't even pay off itself. It also doesn't set anything up for the next movie. All we can look forward to are characters who are mostly the same as they were before this movie began, and a hope that Luke Skywalker makes an appearance as a force ghost to do something epic. I find the path and the story of the current characters very superficial and uninteresting. I do not feel the same way as I did at the end of The Force Awakens where I was excited and looking forward to the next movie. There are multiple plots going along at the same time and really only the Rey and Luke plot was interesting to me. Much of what happens seems like filler and has little consequence on the plot. There were also some heavy-handed political messages, which distracted from the film experience for me, mainly because they weren't done well. I think this movie also suffers with re-watchability. After seeing The Force Awakens, there were several scenes I looked forward to watching at home on my TV, but with The Last Jedi, I am struggling to think of a scene I want to see again. Maybe the Luke/R2 scene, Luke/Yoda, or maybe the throne room battle. I guess I could just look those scenes up on YouTube and save myself 2.5 hours. I'm not ranking this movie low because I'm an upset fanboy, it just wasn't a very good movie. Aside from any Star Wars related missteps, which there are several, a movie that barely rolls along with lack-luster characters and no payoff from the beginning to the end, it just isn't a good movie.

"480",3.5,"  eventually the mob mentality of hate this movie gets will die out and it will be seen as what it is. while it's not the best in the saga it is certainly a welcome addition that offers plenty of moments that are right up there with the best in the series. it's a welcome change of pace after The Force Awakens played it a little too safe and relied to heavily on the ""mystery box"" method that has failed jj abrahms on several occasions now. the movie has a few flaws that hold it back; but if you look at the overwhelmingly negative review, you'll find many inconsistency's on why people actually dislike it. i mainly decided to write this after seeing someone bash Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, claiming ""you'd think this was their first movie"", to claim their performances were poor while most of the movies biggest detractors find hamill and fishers performances to be the strong point of the movie. i feel its simply unfair for this movies fan rating to sit as low as it is with so many mindless, and idiotic reviews coming from people who would normally not bother adding a review to the movie if there wasn't this mob mentality of hate that this movie has recived. you would have to be a moron to say that this film somehow retroactively makes the prequels better, or somehow is as bad as the prequels, which is far from the case. you assholes make it so hard to enjoy anything and the fact that people refuse to acknowledge that this film has any positives at all and act like it was just a shit show from start to end is mind boggling.","The Last Jedi",480,4.1,0.6

"501",0.5,"  Disney really killed the Star Wars series by creating this movie, as well as the 7th. Please tell me that you can see that the 7th and 8th are exactly like the 4th and 5th, there is even a snow planet in the 8th, just like the 5th. Furthermore, the terrible humor made me choke on my popcorn, meaning I chocked many times. This isn't a dumb animation like the fucken Emoji movie, which by the way was terrible. Luke, Poe, Finn, and Ray's funny lines were fine, but what made me want to commit harakiri was when Lea started talking about her hair when she saw her brother for the first time in at least 10 years. Also, I know star wars is a SiFi and also has the force, but I think that someone surviving outer space and not dying from that blast like Lea did is really pushing the boundaries. To be honest, It would have made more sense if she had died there. Snoke's death was very anticlimactic and you can see the similarity between his and Palpatine's death in the 6th, where they both trusted their followers to do their work. You would think that the new Supreme Leader would have been smart enough to figure out that he connected Ray and Kylo too close so that their bond was strong. The French guy who turned on Fin and Rose, who by the way didn't really do much in the film, was probably the most creative character. We can't celebrate for Disney just yet, because the smuggler guy turned Finn and Rose in just as Lando Calrissian did to Han Solo in the 8th. I believe Disney messed up by not killing either Rose or Finn in the final scene where she saves him. Rose was a useful character up to the point that they were in battle, and there are too many main characters to live. The fact that Captain Phasma may have fallen to her death is unlikely, but if she did, that is really stupid on your part Disney. In final, I could get a bunch of guys who just do dumb Coca Cola commercials and have them make a more creative star wars than disney. First, they even kept the snow planet from the 4th, how can you be that much of a dumbass? Second, the repetitive death of the Supreme Leader, which came from the 6th. Hey, Rain Johnson, did you just copy the script from the 5th, add some its of the 6th and then use higher budget animations? Because if you did that, you did it right. I hope Karry Fisher, bless her soul, didn't see her scene with the hair thing, because I think she would have quit on the spot. Finally, I can't believe you dumb ass movie judges rated this movie a 91% and rated Jumper only 16%. At least that movie is original.","The Last Jedi",501,4.1,3.6
"502",0.5,"  This movie is a complete travesty. All the individuals from the original trilogy are completely out of character and act nothing like they did in the originals. Their legacies get completely trashed. The movie tried so hard to be artsy and deep, but did it so blatantly obviously that all it wound up being was deeply annoying. The plot is a complete mess with random tangents all over the place that don't serve to progress the movie or characters at all. It was disheartening to see how some of my favorite characters were portrayed in this film, and the sad thing is that this can now not be undone. I don't know how this screenplay got the green light from Disney, but this movie has effectively ruined Star Wars for me and a lot of other people I know. I will likely never watch another Disney Star Wars movie after this one because I frankly don't care anymore. I wish I could give this movie negative stars, but 1/2 a star will have to do.","The Last Jedi",502,4.1,3.6
"503",2,"  I waited until the movie came out on DVD and only watched once. I am not a hard-core fan, but I grew up with and loved the original trilogy. I had mixed opinions on the prequels, Force Awakens, and Rogue One. I critiqued Force Awakens for being somewhat of a re-hash with silly progressive maneuvers in tokenism. 1.) The progressive agenda that I mildly disliked in Force Awakens and Rogue One was doubled-down in this movie to an intolerable degree. The identity politics in casting became distracting, as if the director wanted to emphasize just how many women and people of color are in the Resistance. 2.) On a separate note, the desire for ""a twist at every turn"" and subvert fandom became jarring. Established elements and tropes of prior movies were discarded, much like a ""laser sword"" with and elitist disgust. 3.) The use of BB-8 and Porgs became increasingly less clever throughout the movie and were clearly watered-down advertisements. 4.) If the 3 or more story-lines were episodes of a Netflix series, the audience score would be much higher. However, instead of episodes, the disparate plots were thinly connected by a handful of scenes and billed as a single movie.","The Last Jedi",503,4.1,2.1
"504",2,"  If Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy came to bury Star Wars, and not enliven it, then their spark will light the fire that will burn the whole galactic edifice down. Little to no hope that JJ Abrams can restore any sense of fun or hope or mystery to this franchise in Episode Whatever. The porgs are cute, though.","The Last Jedi",504,4.1,2.1
"505",2,"  While rather good in general, a lot of pointless small characters take away our attention of the big story, sometimes killing the mood. The Force is treated as something it's not originally, only Yoda's words make sense in SW8. Great acting mostly but too many bugs in the science and the action scenes. The CGI is breathtaking but was expected to be. To sum up: this movie didn't bring anything new and both the big bad guy and the big nice guy died... in an none epic way... which was lame to say the least...","The Last Jedi",505,4.1,2.1
"506",0.5,"  This sad iteration of the first Star Wars movie is filled with weak attempts at humor, overshadowed by political overtones leading one to question if there is anything left sacred from a time when humans were allowed to simply enjoy themselves rather than be forcibly ""educated"" regarding the apparent flaws in their political views.

"516",5,"  Well, all I have to say is a huge ""THANK YOU"" to Rian Johnson for not making another dump down enough movie for stupids with no life to like! The Last Jedi is visually stunning, it goes deep into it's characters' journey, especially with Kylo Ren, it is well-crafted and it deviates from the black-white perpsective of George Lucas' original trilogy! I am so glad we can finally see some depth in an overly simplistic franchise, and I say that as a Star Wars fan, though with a broader knowledge in film studies! Yes we all love it because it was part of our childhood, but the Last Jedi was the first movie in this franchise that didn't make you feel like a 12 year old... Again, thank you Rian Johnson! Don't worry, this will go down as one of the best films up in the franchise!","The Last Jedi",516,4.1,-0.9

"526",3.5,"  This movie is messy in terms of execution and writing as the Casino subplot is the worst part of this film. It seems to distract from the other plots which one is going at a slow pace and the other is trying to develop the main characters. Many of the elements from ""The Force Awakens"" could have been built up but instead were wasted opportunities or ignored. The acting from the cast though is top notch and CGI, for the most part, was good. The use of colours and shots during fight sequences are great. The musical score by John Williams is always lovely to hear.Even though there are questions that the movie brings up and doesn't answer it's not a bad movie. It does make me wonder what will happen in IX.","The Last Jedi",526,4.1,0.6
"527",5,"  ""You failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me.""When I was a boy, watching Return of the Jedi on VHS, I began to realize I was watching something more than just a grand spectacle with action and adventure. By the end of that film Luke Skywalker saves the day, not by blowing something up or wielding a light sabre. Instead, he throws his sword away and sacrifices himself. He does something that most cinematic heroes do not do. He forgoes violence and puts his faith in the humanity found in the destructive and corrupt monster he was meant to slay. Learning that the entertaining action film I was watching was also a story of forgiveness and redemption, left a mark on me at a young age. I believe it is why my love of the Star Wars films endured into my adulthood.In the Last Jedi, Rian Johnson also succeeds in his attempt to create a movie that was more than just an adolescent spectacle. He does give us a film with desperate space battles, wondrous creatures and emotional duels with laser swords. However, he also takes the time to create an unexpected journey for each of the main characters. In this film the reckless hotshot doesn't get to be the hero with a foolhardy act of youthful bravado that ignores the costs of war. The hard-driven general, who has always been the strongest soldier no matter what the cruel galaxy takes from her, finally feels the burden of all she has lost. The survivalist learns why he must sacrifice. And in this saga, the villain and the hero are left with no clear quest or mentors to guide them. The film ends with Luke Skywalker saving the day in a unique and unexpected twist that upon reflection is very familiar. Like in Return of the Jedi, he does not use his laser sword or grab or push something with the force. But instead, through an act of sacrifice and faith, he inspires a new galaxy of heroes and redeems himself.The Last Jedi did not go the way I thought. It was a more complicated, daring and complete film and it will hopefully leave a mark on young fans for a lifetime.","The Last Jedi",527,4.1,-0.9

"532",1,"  Anyone else notice how every positive review of TLJ is some vague, boring-ass variation of ""it was bold! It was different!"" that manages to avoid any meaningful justification - whereas the legion negative reviews are scathingly precise, passionately written and chock-filled with specific examples of why the movie sucked. We all know the truth - TLJ was a confused, poorly executed film that was more concerned with potty jokes and lazy ""gotcha!"" plot beats than actual storytelling. Any critic worth their salt knows this too, but they can't say anything for fear of going against the prevailing social justice groupthink of hollywood. Critics are facing a major credibility crisis (as is Rotten Tomatoes). More of them are becoming bought-and-paid-for corporate shills scared to ""toe the party line"". They prize ideology over art (storytelling) and that's a VERY dangerous place to be. Hope they're prepared to be not taken seriously anymore. Lastly, I'll say I have ZERO problem with socially progressive themes in sci fi - after all, that's always been a hallmark of the genre - however Rian Johnson presents his social justice themes with all the subtlety and nuance of a fifth grader (disposable C-plot with a black and female asian, disproportionate number of strong female characters, weak or buffoonish male characters needing the guidance of said females). Come on Rian! These feel so obvious and forced that they insult your audience's intellect - and ultimately serve to distract, not enhance, your story.","The Last Jedi",532,4.1,3.1

"546",5,"  The online hate for this film does not reflect the critics praise around the world, the A rating on CinemaScore and it certainly does not reflect my view of this film that I have now seen 3 times. One of which was at a press screening a week before it came out with about 10 people, to a packed house that following Thursday. A house that cheered multiple times, I might add. Look, opinions are your own...and you are entitled to them...but some of the comments make me think you do not know this franchise. The Last Jedi is a beautiful film with rich performances by a stellar cast. I gave it an A on BatmanOnFilm and it is now an A+. Below is my initial review, but all I can say is go see it. See it TWICE! And if you read novels growing up, throw those out. Sorry, that is not canon for these films. The Last Jedi is a masterpiece, don't believe toxic fandom. SYNOPSIS: In Lucasfilm's STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, the Skywalker saga continues as the heroes of THE FORCE AWAKENS join the galactic legends in an epic adventure that unlocks age-old mysteries of the Force and shocking revelations of the past.I just arrived home from my second screening of Rian Johnson's THE LAST JEDI (AKA STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII) and all I can think about is this coming up Sunday when I am scheduled to see the movie again.After my Monday press screening (thanks to BOF founder/editor-in-chief Bill ""Jett"" Ramey), I felt a bit disoriented. The film did not resonate with me in the way that I wanted it to, nor did the characters go in the direction I wanted them to go in.But after that second viewing, I get it...100% get it.Rian Johnson is a genius. We are in good hands for his future, non-Skywalker centric trilogy too, I might add.If you have ever read my movie reviews on BOF, you know that I don't do the typical formula where I break down the film for you. Rather, I tell you how the film made me feel. I can tell you is that I feel like I just had an experience at a Star Wars film that will resonate with me for many years to come.Some of my quibbles from Monday still remain. A couple of major characters were somewhat wasted. And, as amazingly badass as they were, the constant battle sequences wore a bit thin after a while. Still, the cast makes this a Star Wars experience for the ages.I absolutely love what director Johnson, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley did with Kylo and Rey. Their next chapter will be one that will give me more grey hairs, since I have to wait another 2 years for it!Poe (Oscar Isaac) is becoming this trilogy's Han Solo, with this heroic swagger and anti-authority demeanor...and I cannot wait to see what JJ Abrahams does with him in EPISODE IX.But the runaway star is Mark Hamill.He shows us an older, broken Luke. A Luke more cynical than brave, but with the eyes of a man in a perpetual struggle to be both.Rian's script is full of heart, humor, depth and true character studies. And his directing allows his script to breathe and for his actors to embrace said material with razor sharp artistic precision.As much as I love THE FORCE AWAKENS, it is fair to say it was very much a love letter to George Lucas' original film, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE. THE LAST JEDI isn't a love letter to anyone or anything. But rather a labor of love, compliments of Johnson and company.It is fresh. Bold. Original. And incredibly brave.Unlike its predecessor, it feels like a continuation of all the films before it. ALL of them. Yes, including the prequels - and that is a GOOD thing.I read someone say (and I'm paraphrasing) that THE LAST JEDI was the first Star Wars film that wasn't just about growing up, but rather growing old. I 100% agree. With this being Carrie Fisher's last performance, that sentiment rings even more true (some of her scenes will give you chills!).Perhaps that is why this chapter in the Skywalker saga resonates with me more so than any Star Wars film has in years. Not only is it surprisingly unique and unexpected, but it is also incredibly poignant.At one point in the film, Luke looks at Rey and says, ""This is not going to go the way, you think!"" Listen to Luke.Go see this film. Hell, go see it multiple times.I look forward to writing more about it; as well as discussing it on an upcoming BOF podcast where we can all peel back the onion together after everyone gets a chance to see it.Until then, May the Force Be With You and...PORGS! - Rick ShewGRADE: A","The Last Jedi",546,4.1,-0.9

"548",5,"  I watched this in the theater then rented at home, through here and all the negative reviews are from people who did not understand this movie, or did not want it to go their way. This movie is way better than I thought watching it the second time, without all the preconceived biases I had because of all the negativity around it. Watching it with an open mind, not only is this a great movie, but it is most defiantly a Star Wars movie and holds true to the Star Wars paradigm! Don't let the naysayers distract you from watching this great movie and forming a preconceived bias against it. Rotten Tomatoes has the critics at 91% saying it is a great movie, and they are right!","The Last Jedi",548,4.1,-0.9

I feel like some of the decisions might either anger or please fans. it completely changes star wars as it is the most unique star wars yet. I t seriously plays against your expectations so i suggest you should go in with 0 expectations. My 3rd favorite star wars film and possibly my favorite film of the year. BTW, haters, go screw off. I give this film 5 out of 5 just to aggregate you guys like you did with the people you aggregated for loving this movie.","The Last Jedi",550,4.1,-0.9
"551",3.5,"  I'm a super fan of Star Wars, but the latest one was a bit disappointing. Killing the former characters? Really? Not much creativity happening neither. I think is time to re-watch the 1970's and 80's again and get the spirit of what Star Wars is about.","The Last Jedi",551,4.1,0.6

"554",3.5,"  This was such a horrendous mistake. From the beginning to the end. This was clearly a case of SJW work that ran amoke. The story was horrible, the characters were horrible outside of checking off the diversity boxes it should be scrapped from the universe all together. Actually so should be the last one. This movie combined with awakens officially killed Star Wars for me. I don't care if they ever mak another.

"560",3.5,"  Generally had a very fun experience at the theater the two times I went to see it. But I have to admit there a lot of unanswered questions as well. What sticks out to me is a fantastic choreographed fight scene involving Kylo and Rey (trying not to mention spoilers) replete with cheering and raucous shouts from the theater audience! There are a lot of surprises in this film, and it needs to be given some credit for that...even if a few might be disappointing to long time fans.","The Last Jedi",560,4.1,0.6
"561",0.5,"  I don't think I've ever had how bad a movie is so completely explained to me and yet, upon viewing the movie realize that the level of terrible within it was understated as with The Last Jedi.

"562",1,"  Only five minutes or so out of over two hours train wreck felt anything like a true Star Wars movie.The acting was forced. The dialog insipid. At no point did this piece of crap make me care about any of the characters. No mourning over Han's death?The actor who played Poe Dameron was ridiculously over the top and, somehow wooden at the same time. He has been good in other films (such as Sucker Punch), but his rapidly bouncing emotional reactions made me wonder if he earned his acting degree through a correspondence course. In short...Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars.It was not even worth the price of a RB rental.","The Last Jedi",562,4.1,3.1

"567",5,"  Much the same way Empire Strikes Back was a character play that took a deep dive into all of the original characters and their relationships with one another, so too is The Last Jedi, which takes us on Rey's journey of self discovery. I thought the pace was good, and the action sequences were quite satisfying. I liked how conflicted Luke was, thought the cameo appearance of Yoda was appropriate and well written, and overall thought this movie was a great ""passing of the torch""... Looking forward to the next one!","The Last Jedi",567,4.1,-0.9
"568",1.5,"  As an avid star wars fan, I've been waiting 2 years for this sequel to finally happen and after leaving the theater, I was a little bit disappointed in what the end result we got with this long awaited sequel. J.J. Abrams set up that cliffhanger at the end of The Force Awakens only for Rian Johnson to take it and throw it off the cliff (literally!). every scene on the island was terrible and now ""force skype"" suddenly exists between rey and kylo ren supposedly. however they did add a new interesting new ability about the force where you can hologram yourself from thousands of lightyears away however using it too much can kill you. I hate how they handled the characters in this film and the film itself didn't quite have the same tone as it did with the force awakens except for the first scene on the island playing the music from the previous film during the scene. the humour was abit off especially how they kept using general hux as a punching bag in almost every scene he is in. I thought the whole Canto Bight Casino scene was pointless and too long. Out off all the time they had to exclude that whole scene, they could've answered the questions that us (the audience) had when we left the theaters from The Force Awakens such as who are rey's parents? who is snoke and where did he come from? (which by the way don't get your hopes up because he gets killed off with no story and his death leads to probably one of the best most unlikely lightsaber partnership duel massacres in the entire franchise only when you think kylo ren has finally reached the light, he decides hes bad again after literally helping a foe fight off his own side. Plus there were moments that. And Luke Skywalker was not the Luke a Skywalker I remembered from the Original Trilogy. He was grouchy and every scene he felt obligated and forced (no pun intended) to be in the film. I found the Rose character to be extremely annoying and she would not leave finn alone and give him space to breathe ever in this film. I understand this movie is meant mostly to kids but even films like this can appeal to adults (especially adults who grew up during the original trilogy). I don't hate the film because of the direction they were trying to go (I did like how they were trying to do something different and i'll give them props for that) I just hate how this film was poorly thought out and written. even mark Hamill said that he hated and disagreed with what rian Johnson did with his character. especially how considering in the original trilogy how despite how evil darth vader was, he knew and saw a little bit of good still left in him. however in this film he senses the dark side in kylo ren (who was ben solo at the time of this scene) and he tries to murder him in his sleep. that's not luke skywalker. anyway since jj abrams is back in the director's seat for episode ix, I hope he corrects all the mistakes that rian Johnson made with this film and redeem this franchise before it gets any worse. anyway I hope they learn from this film and move forward. I haven't lost all faith in star wars (yet). I cant wait to see what episode ix has in store in 2019 to conclude the trilogy","The Last Jedi",568,4.1,2.6
"569",2,"  The film just did not do it for me - mainly because nothing really changes for the characters from beginning to end. You could essentially skip this film and go straight to Episode 9 without missing much.","The Last Jedi",569,4.1,2.1

After an initial 32 year waiting to see luke and getting ripped off by force awakens, then another two to see him in his full glory, we get the last jedi. not only were there no big space battles, let a lone a bona fides lightsaber fight or two, but luke is, to put it too politely, underwhelming. This movie elevated the prequels, and vaulted return of the jedi to the best one of the eight episodes simply because of the missed opportunity with luke. what a shame. it did have some good individual moments and a good soundtrack. my interest in episode iX & beyond is minimal because of this movie.","The Last Jedi",593,4.1,2.1

"599",5,"  ""Let The Past Die. Kill It, If You Have To.""Rian Johnson is able to bring the saga in to our current intellectual time age. The rediscovery of themes like duality, transcendence and egolessness was something needed for the Star Wars saga to move forward. Like George did with the original trilogy, this movie will bring joy and wisdom to the younger generations who in a long term will be able to grasp these concepts. Again if youre stucked in the past, meaning (an unwillingness to grasp and integrate old important values from a childhood long gone and bringing them forward and developing them to the current adult mind in a post-rational era), this movie will seem totally irrelevant. As Luke Skywalker goes from the heroic young and innocent into the dark night of the soul only to discover boundaryless enlightenment, so should we the audience. Going from the light to the darknes, from darkness to light, creating grey, creating light, and landing in emptyness again. Star Wars is again relevant.

"602",1,"  The Last Jedi is Disney's Order 66 on longtime Star Wars fans. ""Hunt them down. Round them up. Annihilate them.""It's also Order 66 on the Original Trilogy, and three of the most iconic characters in film history: Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Luke Skywalker. You can throw in Chewbacca, Yoda, 3PO and R2 for that matter.TLJ is a complete, insulting nothing. Absolute waste of space.TFA and TLJ tease what everyone really wanted to see, which was Luke's Jedi academy, training, good Kylo, his fall to the Dark Side, the Knights of Ren, destroying the Jedis-in-training and leaving Luke for dead. That should have been Episode 7. It would have been effing fantastic. But, no, we get the cock tease otherwise known as The Force Awakens, followed by The Last Jedi, which douses the audience in ice water and then throws the saga into the abyss.After the fall of Kylo in Episode 7, Episode 8 could be the fall of the New Republic after a surprise assault from the outer regions by Snoke and the First Order. Galactic warfare and desolation on a Titanic scale (instead of the slow speed search for a petrol dump the Last Jedi took). The Force Awakens, Rey comes to the forefront, Han Solo dies.In Episode IX they would be set up for the grand finale between Luke, Rey, Kylo, and whatever other baddie Abrams has planned.Point is, they could have the story go in the same direction as they intended all along, but not fuck the fans with crap movies while getting there.TLJ is gutter trash, and pulls TFA into the sewer with it. By the way, I watched the deleted scenes for free online, and they flesh out nothing, are completely awful, and deserved to be cut, along with almost every scene that actually made it into the movie.","The Last Jedi",602,4.1,3.1
"603",2,"  New characters are dull and unlikeable. I just can't find a reason to root for them. Rey is a shake-and-bake jedi. Ridiculous action scenes. It was a decent sci-fi movie but a far cry from genuine Star Wars.","The Last Jedi",603,4.1,2.1

Should have used books as source material, instead we get this overhyped dribble.. Sad to think this may be John Williams last film. I also agree with Hamill when it comes to the direction Luke has supposedly taken, becoming one with the force. I don't think it was time and you risked losing the nostalgia factor, which you did. Props on the space battle scene in the beginning, phenomenal job with the sisters connection. I'm not a total snob! ;)","The Last Jedi",608,4.1,3.6
"609",2,"  This is miles better than TFA, just setting JJ Abrams aside and keeping that monster from interfering, has produced a decent movie. There are no major continuity issues or incoherent scenes, so that's a great improvement over the mess of TFA. That said, the script remains quite bad. They keep making a copy of the original storyline, they spin it, switch it, repaint over it, but it's a poor choice nonetheless. The jokes seem misplaced, known characters seem out of character, and the new characters are not given anything to work with.Daisy Ridley is a treasure, and again they misuse her, wasting an incredible opportunity.One thing they do right is female representation, all movies of all genres should look like TLJ in that regard.However as a Star Wars flick, it's poor.","The Last Jedi",609,4.1,2.1

"611",0.5,"  This movie doesn't even merit 1/2 Star, but it's the least I could give it without looking like I forgot to give it a star rating. I've been a Star Wars fan for 33 years, but this movie has officially killed the saga for me. Politics, animal rights, and child abuse commentary combined with terrible acting, dreadfully worthless story lines, and dialogue such as ""we won't win by fighting what we hate, we'll win by saving what we love"" make for 152 minutes of eye rolling. This movie stars Luke Skywalker playing the role of Mark Hammil, as well as a cast of totally forgettable supporting actors with no chemistry. Go home Star Wars, you're drunk. Never, ever let Rian Johnson near Star Wars again, please.","The Last Jedi",611,4.1,3.6

"614",5,"  This was a great film don't care what the audience scores are I loved it. Sad that Luke had do go but at least his end didn't feel rushed like Han solos was. Definitely can say I loved this movie, but I guess star wars fans will be star wars fans. All who cling on too tightly to the past with out excepting the new story. I had my doubts at first because of the way force awakens was, but I have to say the last jedi was amazing and should still be loved as much as the original trilogy not compared.","The Last Jedi",614,4.1,-0.9

"620",2.5,"  Pro: Incredible art and visual effectsCons: Weak, clunky story, poor chemistry between Rose and Finn, and enough plot holes to fly a Mandator IV Siege Dreadnought through.Overall the movie gets a 'Meh' rating from me. It does not lend itself well to the Space Opera feel that Star Wars trilogies are famous for. Don't blame any of the actors and actresses in the least, they did the best they could with the garbage that Rian Johnson gave them. Btw, this opinion is held by my sister, a transwoman lesbian liberal, so no it wasn't catering to SJW. We also both agree that there is absolutely no way that Rey would not have fallen to the Dark Side, being raised as practically a slave, treated like garbage worse than Anakin was in the Phantom Menace, had 'friends' that betrayed her in that novel about three of the main characters. We both thought it would have been far more interesting an ending had she actually joined Kylo and a major twist no one at all would have expected.What Rian Johnson should be credited for is creating the dumbest female character in the entire Star Wars franchise (both cannon and Legends). I speak of course of Admiral Holdo, for if she just told SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND STAFF of the ship she just switched her flag to (Poe Dameron most specifically) what the plan was, Poe wouldn't have gotten Finn and Rose off the ship to find a slicer (Legends term for hacker) that eventually betrays them for money, caused the death of dozens if not hundreds of members of the Resistance.","The Last Jedi",620,4.1,1.6

"623",0.5,"  It's as if the people who wrote and directed this movie never saw a Star Wars movie, including the Force Awakens. Just a truly awful movie. Pretty much kills the franchise - in the future I'm pretty sure people will consider the 'Star Wars' movies to just be the first six (the prequels might have been 'meh' - but this was awful and ignores things like continuity, plot, logic, and tone. I'd give it zero stars if that were possible. Half a star is because the music was Star Wars-esque.","The Last Jedi",623,4.1,3.6

"637",0.5,"  After a long wait, what a disappointment this movie is. Story feels rushed with many plot-holes and continuity problems from TFA.It looks and sounds like a Star wars movie with its cutting edge visuals, amazing sound-fx and gorgeous music score by John Williams. But it feels empty, with no character development, it lacks any kind of emotional content. I couldn't care less about any of the new characters now, which is a shame because they had so much potential after TFA.I loved both TFA and Rogue-one, but I just cannot accept TLJ. It feels like a cheap generic sci-fi movie in a flashy Star wars wrapper. I sincerely hope the Star wars brand can recover, but the last jedi was a big let down for me and left me very unhappy and disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie.","The Last Jedi",637,4.1,3.6

"641",4.5,"  As the war between General Leia's (Carrie Fisher) Resistance and Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) First Order esculates to new heights, Rey (Daisy Ridley) must now attempt to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the last Jedi Knight, to leave his self-imposed exile behind and rejoin the battle against evil...For the last two years, starting with the release of 2015's The Force Awakens, the combined efforts of Lucasfilm and Disney have managed to bring George Lucas's galaxy far far away, towards exciting new directions and opportunities with that film in spite of J.J. Abrams's tendency to reuse elements from the original trilogy throughout that film. The second film in the sequel trilogy, The Last Jedi, thankfully ditches this approach to storytelling in it's writing, although not in the way that one would expect based on what the marketing campaign suggests.Despite the presence of the infamous bird-like alien ""Porgs"" and having funnier banter than usual in a Star Wars film, it doesn't change the fact that The Last Jedi is possibly the most brutal and bleak film in the franchise since Revenge of the Sith. Rian Johnson isn't afraid of depicting the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order as a much more desperate and brutal conflict as shown in scenes in which quite a few known characters get axed off in seconds and the consequences of war, as shown in the sub-plot of Poe Dameron's (Oscar Issac) conflict with Leia's trusted Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), gets much greater focus than before. A far-cry from the serial-inspired battles of the original films, to be sure.Mark Hamill, after only getting a small cameo in the last film, steals the show as a grumpier, embittered Luke while the recently departed Carrie Fisher gives an excellent final performance as Leia, although given the circumstances of her death, some of her scenes can be quite upsetting to watch. Although both John Boyega and newcomer Kelly Marie Tran have excellent chemistry between each other and the previously mentioned Oscar Issac finally gets to flesh out his character a lot more, both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren don't seem to be as committed as last time though as a lot of thier scenes drag on for ages.Overall, despite having some incredibly odd moments and some unsatisfactory pay-offs, The Last Jedi is a wonderful film to celebrate not only the 40th birthday of the film that launched the Modern Age of cinema, but also to remember why we loved these films in the first place. With the tragic passing of Carrie, Kenny Baker and numourous other figures in the franchise over the last two years, the most important thing to remember is that, to quote Master Yoda himself, it's important to ""pass on, all that you've learned"" and keep moving forward without relying too much on the past and judging by the overall message of this film, it couldn't be more true than ever.","The Last Jedi",641,4.1,-0.4

The setup the Episode VII has been ignored giving Rian Johnson unlimited power as to commit a rape of Star Wars universe. If you enjoyed the Original Trilogy, respect, love and relate to its characters, stay away from this atrocity of a movie.The plot and character development are a lame jape and never have I seen so much identity politics shoved in cinematic experience just to pander to certain demographics in an attempt to maximize profits. I rejoice in seeing the agenda and approach introduced by the current Lucasfilm president fails. Doubling down or even tripplilng down on her agenda will lead Star Wars further towards 6 feet underground. I will neither acknowledge, nor forgive Kahleen Kennedy for calling shots as to killing off one the best Star Wars charcters (spolier alert, this character's name rhymes with Johnny Walker).Absolutely disgracefull and self-righteous of current Lucasfilm leadership to stand for this film, not acknowledge obvious mistakes and ideological overtone they are so desperately trying to push.","The Last Jedi",643,4.1,3.6

"658",1,"  SPOILER FILLED REVIEWFinally saw The Last Jedi and it's ok, but in no shape or form second best after TESB. What I liked most was the character development of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, very well build up as the main proponent of the dark side, no second Vader but he doesn't need to be, actually a much more complex and interesting character.The battle scenes were impressive and the movie looks and sounds beautiful.There's a few funny moments that work well, not the Porgs though, what do these anoying penguins in a star wars movie, they didn';t learn their lesson from Jar Jar Binks.Carrie Fisher was great, even though the space scene was utterly ridiculous. The reunion with Luke was very well handled even though he turned out to be a bloody hologram, jeez.I loved the reunion of Luke with Yoda, to me the most moving scene, quite magical.Ok, the gripes:- Luke was badly handled and I know it's a very subjective opinion, but on this topic it can't be anything else of course. I didn't want, what some fans seemed to be craving for, a reunion with Leia and Han and the old gang kicks ass one more time. That would have been stupid in my mind, but the way it eventually ended up being handled didn't feel right to me either.Of course the movie is about Luke/Rey (being the last Jedi) I excpected way more than the scenes they had together.Even though, if you think back, Luke's training by Yoda wasn't spend that much time on either, but somehow impacted you more, because Luke leaves, though before completing it, called away by the urge to save his friends. Rey leaves, because she has no time left to help her friends, but also because she is disappointed and failed by Luke, Big difference.Also a gripe that keeps resurfacing, the parallels with the original trilogy are becoming a bit annoying and to be honest, come accross as a bit lazy by the writers.Rey has become annoying and in no way captures your heart as Luke did in the original trilogy, sorry, she has a lot of spunk, but memorable she the character is not. Don't know why yet, but I think it's the writing not the actress.Still don't have a clue what Finn is good for in this story, baffles me how he keeps getting screentime even though the character is developing nowhere.Damon Poe has replaced him as the more fun rebel.Didn't like at all the send offs of two of the new villains Snoke as well as Captain Phasma, apart from the fact that nobody kicks Brienne of Tarth's ass, sorry Poe, they both deserved a way better ending, having been build up in part seven and then show them once and off they go?That;s crappy writing and no one will convince me otherwise and a shame because both had potential.Anyway, I am very glad there was a new Star Wars and well, since the old garde is now gone, I hope they will start truly taking the reigns of the franchise storywise and actually come up with someting new and not just a badly disguised rehash of the original trilogy.","The Last Jedi",658,4.1,3.1
"659",0.5,"  This was bad, I saw it in the theaters and have decided I will never see another Star Wars movie until the franchise is bought by someone new. I'm sad I'm late for a timely review to be perfectly honest. Maybe, just maybe I could've saved someone from viewing this terrible movie.Firstly Rey is a Mary Sue, insanely overpowered. Secondly Holdo makes her plan not apparent and causes a mutiny. Thirdly I simply hate how the whole destiny thing got torn apart and Luke was made into a sad, sorry character. I would go into more detail, but I'd rather not dig into this toxic sludge anymore.","The Last Jedi",659,4.1,3.6

"671",5,"  Easily the best of the newer Star Wars movies. This one gives you something more in the best way. The Force Awakens was enjoyable as well but purely runs on nostalgic value.

"687",4.5,"  Thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of times where you think you know where it's going and it surprises you with a changeup. Has the typical time/space realism problems of other Star Wars movies, but that's a minor concern. Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren are in particularly fine form throughout and strong character development is focused on Poe Dameron - not bad for a character who wasn't originally going to survive the first movie.","The Last Jedi",687,4.1,-0.4

"700",2.5,"  When a movie is made the director has a first cut, then he cuts out all the stuff that does not move the plot forward, or are just fluff and unnecessary. It's like he did that but then got confused because the movie was only 15 minutes long, so he just made a move from the deleted scenes.Almost everything that went on in this movie was pointless to the plot, which was The rebels are almost wiped out and need to survive, and escape.","The Last Jedi",700,4.1,1.6
"701",2,"  The movie is about an hour too long which makes the payoff not worth it.","The Last Jedi",701,4.1,2.1
"702",3,"  Episode 8 is a mixed bag of good and bad, essentially it is two movie jammed together and flows just as well as that sentence implies. Abrams should have directed the entire new trilogy instead the new director ignored everything Abrams had built up and wasted several promising characters and plotlines in the process.The Luke, Rey, Ren section of the movie was good but The Canto Bight sequence was very reminiscent of episode one; too much CGI, pointless characters, and sideplots that went nowhere.While the franchise is not dead per se, it is badly wounded. If they had cut out the Canto bight sequence and eliminated the Poe mutiny sideplot then this would've been a much better movie and at 2 1/2 hours a much shorter movie.","The Last Jedi",702,4.1,1.1
"703",1.5,"  I liked Ep7... First time, i come from cinema, already i liked this Ep too, but with a large criticism around i come to see again it, and look close to story, characters, and compare it to all other films and stories... Its disaster, yea, its fun, its comedy, but its all. Enjoy is not all for Star Wars, its about character progression, a huge villains and heroes, about drama even a comedy, about story and nice endings... Ryan Johnson kill SW by a simple joy from film, and if you dont see it, turn every episodes again on your screen...","The Last Jedi",703,4.1,2.6
"704",2,"  Not good. Visually wonderful and DRIVER gives a great performance but other than that? The movie doesn't really work. And the casino subplot is pointless I get what their trying to articulate but it made the movie 40 minutes longer for NO reason. Poe's plot is nonsensical as well. This film has good moments but that's all they are; moments. ""SALT?!?"" That was the stupidest moment I've seen in a main stream film in a LONG time","The Last Jedi",704,4.1,2.1
"705",0.5,"  worst acting ever, it was really truelly like watching spaceballs, I used to love the star wars franchise so so so so much but I wont be paying to see any of this silly b rate offence to George lucas crap ever","The Last Jedi",705,4.1,3.6
"706",0.5,"  This film ruined Lukes character and the story was unconsistent with force awakens. Ray's parents revelation was a huge upset to what it could of been and the casino scene was a waste of time. Lots of unexplained plot between the films and for the most part a lot of second thinking and twisting to the plot mid movie. Ryan Johnson wanted to try something new by dodging and weaving past every possible exspectation a longtime fan could of had thought up with that could of made any scene better to give us this dissapointment. Even skimming some of the theory forums could of given him an idea to what fans were anticipating and gone off it. Ray being a grand palpatine? Thus explaining her strong force powers and rapid skill, or snoke being plagaus? Giving that character far more meaning and significance and having luke duel him in a most epic showdown never before seen in star wars history, we are talking crators forming, ground cracking, planet evecuating level intensity. He instead made everything ""a twist"" and thus ruining the movie. Next time he should listen to the fans, if he gets a next time.","The Last Jedi",706,4.1,3.6
"707",2,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an insult to the series worse than the prequel trilogy. Just like its predecessor, it focuses on ""reimagining"" the story of the original, but does so in a worst way possible. The Last Jedi contains some of the most moronic scenes in the filming industry I've ever experienced. The way this Star Wars installment treats some of its characters is absolutely incomprehensible to me. How can you take such an iconic, relatable and badass character of all times and turn him into what you see in this movie - a failure? Explain that to me, if you can. Other characters are complete blank now. They have no motivation, no interesting stories to tell, and the worst offender is that they have no purpose to exist in this universe other then to create our so beloved forced diversity. Replace everyone in this film with only white male cast of movie veterans and nothing would change. They'd still be boring, moronic and have nothing to give, but at least there'd be some good performance. Not to say that the cast doesn't know, what they are doing, but they have absolutely nothing to work with. I guess that the writers were given a task like:""PC, feminist and SJW bs first; logic, sense and general storytelling are not important"". Why? Why would you do that? Star Wars was never about that, it was about adventure! And let me tell you, this smoking garbage hardly qualifies as one. It will take for a one hell of a ride. A ride, full of idiots, moronic situations and stupid ways of getting out of them, and most importantly... forced romance. Good god.","The Last Jedi",707,4.1,2.1

"709",0.5,"  Abysmal. This movie is what happens if you have a director that hates all the elements that made Star Wars great (campy heroism, good storytelling, and consistent set of themes to name a few). This is like an 2.5 hour commercial for PETA to the point where I have to know if they actually paid the director. Also really glad they brought in a nihilist codebreaker into the same movie that looks like it was designed to sell stuffed animals to kids to talk about the nuances of arms dealing. Thank you for ruining Poe's character by the way. This movie isn't just bad. It's Rian Johnson giving the middle finger to Lucas in not so subtle ways. Oh you were excited to figure out what the story is with the Jedi sacred texts? Fuck you lol let's have Yodi appear and light them all on fire and say they were boring. Like that's actually what he says. Oh you wanted to see how wise Luke has become and what plot he has cooked up and what he's been doing. Well the most powerful Jedi in the universe tried to kill his disciple for having bad thoughts and now fishes and drinks space cow milk. And oh you wanted to see how Snoke would be as a real villain (seeing how Rey has already beaten Kylo) ? Nope let's make him do a half baked return of the Jedi sidious impersonation and them become completely irrelevant.","The Last Jedi",709,4.1,3.6

"721",1,"  I'm not a major Star Wars fan. I came into this movie with some knowledge on the universe but not enough for me to care about continuity errors or many of the characters. Even then, this movie was not only a bore to sit through, given that the story could have been told in 50 minutes, but it offers nothing that other Star Wars movies don't already do. Many of the characters are incompetent and one-dimensional, the special effects, for the most part, aren't anything snazzy and border on bad, and the story is so padded you'll be glancing at your watch wondering when the movie will be over. At least ""that one scene"" (avoiding spoilers but everyone should know it) with Admiral Holdo is gorgeous. It's a filler movie, and a bad one at that.

"724",5,"  Rian Johnson achieves the feat of bringing us the fantastic Star Wars actions scenes we all love as well as establishing a meaningful and intelligent intellectual conflict within our main characters. The high points of this movie were fantastic, as we were able to see some incredible fight scenes-- both in space and on the ground-- as well as settling down for a few moments to go into a character's psyche. Johnson did a great job of showing the audience how each character's thought process works, and takes us away from the hi-tech flashiness to show us some raw emotions. Although the movie had some fantastic moments, it heavily lacked in other areas. These lacking areas most prominently stem from filler scenes/filler characters. These were evidently placed in the movie simply to add on a third story as well as give some more action. While this will satisfy young members of the audience, it is quite disappointing if you're like to watch a consistently interesting and engaging movie. The low points of this film really took me out of it for the entire scene, but I quickly reentered as the plot got back on track.In the end, it's a Star Wars film! They're always fantastic and I applaud Rian Johnson's courageous take on the story. While the movie has its flaws, its overall story telling and engagement was fantastic.","The Last Jedi",724,4.1,-0.9

"732",4,"  The Last Jedi is without a doubt, the boldest entry in the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson's new direction for the series is risky and subverts audience expectations. Unfortunately, this film is unexpected in a way that feels similar to ordering a pizza, opening the box, and realizing that they forgot the toppings.This film succeeds with its direction, acting, cinematography, special effects, production design, and choreography. But where this film fails is in the script. The most important thing in the Star Wars universe is the characters and instead of developing the characters, this film decides to strip them down for a purpose I hope I begin to understand by the time the next chapter rolls around. You really have to admire Johnson for attempting to turn this saga on its head, but when you walk this thin of a tightrope, you must be careful to maintain your balance. This film is a tonal and structural mess that convolutes the story of this trilogy and opens up several major plot holes that are hopefully addressed as the saga continues.","The Last Jedi",732,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"734",2,"  May Contain Spoilers: With the story they had to work with, I would rather have spent 6 hours with Jar Jar Binks then watch this film again. Even if they overdid the CGI, and the charisma between Anakin Skywalker and Padme was terrible on Episodes 1-3, the rest of the acting was better and the story was solid.I always preferred Episode 4, 'A New Hope', because it stood on its own. Everything else is a sequel or a prequel.Even Rogue One was superior to this muddled mess. They should have made this one before Episodes 7 and 8.Now we have a wondering repetitious story line, poor editing, a budget that did not allow any retakes, a few cute but fakey puppets, a number of locations that were underused, AND original cast members that looked like they had Alzheimer's, with dull eyes and speech impediments.A sophomoric attempt at sci-fi.Notice how much lower the audience score was compared to the critics?Let me help with the story: Yoda is Darth Vader's father or grandfather. Luke is starting to look like Yoda.

Some people will just never be happy. I enjoy the flow of learning about new abilities not explored via the movies. I enjoy the fact that there are force user in Kylo and Snoke that are not Sith, but use the emotion and hate to wield the force. I also like that Rey appears to be heading down a path that might be seen as a Grey Jedi, where emotion and a sense of right intertwine to a point that there is a balance of the force within her. She has feeling and emotions that she allows to shape her decisions, but also has the central idea of the Jedi path to be of service and assistance to those in need.All in all a good movie that I'll enjoy watching over and over again.","The Last Jedi",744,4.1,-0.9
"745",4,"  I'll get right into it, I loved the Last Jedi. As a big sci-fi fan, I am a sucker for a good space battle, and I am happy to report that the Last Jedi has some of the best space battles I have seen. Now I do admit that Rogue One's final space battle may be the best in Star Wars history, the CGI was so good it felt like actual ships, these space battle are definitely a very close second. From the maneuvers performed by Poe when he banks a sharp left to get behind the tie fights chasing him, to the resistance ship sacrificing itself by ripping the First Orders vessel using a Hyperspace Jump. These things were fresh and very welcome.The characters were also great in this movie. The stand out of course is Luke Skywalker. Controversially I never understood his significance in the original trilogy. This movie helps flesh out who he was and his place within the Star Wars Universe. It shows a deeper side to him, a man who has lived a life he didn't expect, or even wanted. He is burdened by the actions of his past, by trying to kill Kylo Ren in a moment of weakness, he feels responsible for the current state of the galaxy. His final fight with Kylo Ren of the salt planet was great. I had noticed he had his return of the Jedi hair and clothes and felt that this was Luke that people remembered. When Kylo orders the First order to fire everything at him, you felt the angry and betrayal he had towards to Luke, and it was great to see Luke playing off that. When it was revealed that Luke had actually only projected himself to the planet and not actually left the Jedi temple, I was a bit taken aback. It was a twist I did not see coming and, for me anyway, it was nice to see the force used in a different way that just moving things across a room. I accepted because the idea of force ghosts has existed in the Star Wars universe since a new hope, so Force projection is something I can get behind. Speaking of Force Ghosts, YODA!! Whenever Yoda showed up to help Luke deal with his issues, I totally fanboyed. It was the Yoda from the original trilogy, whacky and helpful. That was a twist I was not expecting. The other twist I did not expect was Luke's death, the power required to project himself was obviously too much for him and he died on the island after saving everyone from the first order. It was a fitting goodbye to the character, as I've said, force ghosts could allow for his return.The other characters were great in the movie, Ray was developed even further after force awakens. I felt she kind of tread water in the force awakens until the final fight so it was nice seeing her arc throughout the whole movie. While I never expected her to join the dark side as the trailers having us believe, I felt during the movie that it was at least a possibility. Her force connections with Kylo felt personal to both of them and added a depth to each character that I also really enjoyed. The conversation between them when they are talking about Rays nothing junky parents felt intimate and personal. I also really enjoyed Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. He feels like a troubled soul and the conflict he faces every day is shown to great affect and it makes you feel for the character. He is not just a bad guy, he is conflicted by his family lines, by who he wants to be and who people think he should be. Carrie fisher was also very good in this, it will be interesting to see how they deal with her passing after this movie because she is still alive at the end of it. Poe, Finn and the other characters were good as well, nothing stand out but definitely not badNow while there was a lot to love in this movie, there were some things that I did have problems with, the sub-story of Finn and new comer rose trying to find the code breaker felt completely out of place. We had Ray and Luke discussing the Jedi order and if he needed to exist, and we had Poe and Leia taking about the fate of the resistance, and then we had Finn and rose in a flashy casino world riding big horse dog creature. I know that they were there to try and save the resistance, but to me it just didn't fit.Another problem I had was with was Snoke. He was portrayed as this all knowing, all powerful force user. Yet we didn't didn't really see this, other than his ability to connect Ray and Kylo using the force. We also didn't learn much about him before he was ultimately killed by Kylo. I did like how is death was done, but I felt it was a bit of plot point more than a deserved death. If he was all knowing and all powerful surely he would have known that Kylo was using the force on the Light saber beside him and not just the One Kylo was holding.The first Order definitely did not feel as threatening as they should have in this movie either. General Hux felt more of a joke than a leader, and Phasma was again under used. The showed off new First orders weapons like the Dreadnought ship and the battering ram gun but these all felt 1 dimensional and just there to move the story on. Other than a couple of moments the only thing the First order did was follow a ship for 2 hours and shoot at it.VERDICT: INPATIENT CAREThere were definitely some iffy moments in the Last Jedi; I didn't really need to see Luke milk a weird creature udder for blue milk, but overall I think it was a great addition to the Star Wars Universe. It moved the Star Wars Lore along nicely while introducing aspects of existing canon that I felt had turned a bit stale. The characters felt real and their stories felt earned. I am very much looking forward to how this trilogy is brought to an end in the final chapter.David","The Last Jedi",745,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"767",0.5,"  Simply put, don't go see this movie, don't watch it, don't buy it, don't give them your money. This was a horrible movie. I had hopes that they wouldn't screw it up, but they did. I left disappointed, I felt cheated and I didn't even want to watch Star Wars anymore, and I have loved this franchise since I was a kid. They completely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil was in his right to say that he fundamentally disagreed with everything they've decided to do with his character, because Luke is no longer a likable character). I had hoped to see a wise, old, and powerful Luke pulling of force abilities and saber combat that would've rivaled Yoda or Mace Windu. But, nope, they decided to make him a despicable character who barely uses the force, gives bad advice, refuses to teach Rey anything, and wants to rid the universe of the Jedi. The one cool battle scene with him ended up being a trick and he barely did anything (though the force ability he used was cool) then he dies for no apparent reason whatsoever. Rey is still good at everything with no training for nor reason and despite the fact that she is a nobody (yeah, another horrible surprise, her parents were basically the nobodies of nobodies). Her character doesn't progress at all, because she's already good at everything despite not knowing anything. Finn is still a main character for some reason and has a whole side story that turns out to be pointless and he probably should've died. Poe is a good character, until he is demoted and put in his place for no reason other than he didn't trust command because they're plan was stupid and purple hair lady didn't want to tell him anything. The asian girl who is introduced and made a main character for no reason is stupid and does nothing to the story other than give Finn a love interest and create completely unnecessary subplot. Adam Driver does a good job with Kylo, but the writers did a horrible job with the character. He is still unintimadating (I didn't think his character was anywhere near scary in 7 either, definitely not a new Vader) and is kind of stupid and changes emotions every scene. Snoke is shown to be super powerful in an awesome scene, until he is immediately killed by Kylo with a cheap trick that Sidious would've seen through easily. We learn nothing about Snoke so turns out he is another pointless character. Leia uses the force in a laughable scene that was supposed to be serious (apparently multiple theaters reported the audience burst out laughing) and probably should've been killed off. Phasma did nothing and was pointless (a common theme in this movie). Most of this movie would've been forgettable if it didn't piss me off so much because they ruined one of the greatest things ever produced. I'm pretty sure Rain Johnson heard that it was impossible to ruin Star Wars and make the new films worse than the prequels and decided to prove everyone wrong. I wish this movie (and probably The Force Awakens, though I liked that one more) should be wiped from canon and they should remake it. I don't want to watch any future Star Wars films after this one. I no longer plan on seeing Episode 9 or the Han Solo movie because I refuse to give money to these idiots who are ruing one of my favorite franchises of all time. DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.","The Last Jedi",767,4.1,3.6
"768",3.5,"  This latest entry into the Star Wars cinematic universe is a love it or hate it kind of film. By that of course I mean there's moments and ideas you'll love as well as moments and ideas you'll absolutely hate. It definitely improves upon many of the aspects the Force Awakens lacked with a variety of settings and more engaging action sequences. With that in mind, it still proves to be more of a disappointment in killing off important characters needlessly like Admiral Ackbar and Snoke while introducing others that make you scratch your head as to why they're even there with the character of Rose managing to be more detestable than Jar Jar Binks. Furthermore, it features so many plot-holes and unnecessary story elements that it makes the film more frustrating in reflection than it should've been. Nonetheless, its amazing special effects, beautiful production design and heart-pumping score by John Williams save this film from its poor writing. Overall, it is a necessary though unsatisfying watch for the progression of Star Wars storyline.","The Last Jedi",768,4.1,0.6

"770",0.5,"  *Spoilers. Where to start with this piece of work? There were a lot of underdeveloped/pointless new characters and I would argue old characters (from pre-disney) didn't live up to their potential (Luke Skywalker, Leia). Some costumes (Such as Holdo's dress) didn't fit the scenes. A lot of hypocritical actions like Leia pushing responsibility for military deaths onto Poe for actions she had the authority and awareness to stop (when Poe led a successful assault to destroy a lethal threat) or when Rose stopped Finn from committing suicide to protect the resistance and then telling him that the only way to win is to protect the people he loves (which is what he was trying to do and almost did, Rose literally almost got the resistance killed). First Order are childish villains and would be lacking punch if it weren't for the resistance being just as incompetent (First Order are supposed to be a military, yet their general is literally toyed with in the opening scene by an idiot, like an idiot). Old characters are literally killed in the most lacklustre ways. Epic Rey training montage missing. Phasma exists, and then doesn't. Snoke exists, kind of reveals his grand plan, stops existing because Deus Ex Machina. To finish, CANTO BITE (Oh god why was this even recorded). This movie had large backing, talent, and still ended up in a state which leaves me deeply unsatisfied. It shows you the potential gold behind the could-be genius lazing on a couch. Not saying this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen, it's just not something I consider a good movie. 0.5/10 to balance the freaking critics giving this movie 5 stars (91%? Really...). I honestly think it's about a 2.5, or 3 tops.","The Last Jedi",770,4.1,3.6

"773",2,"  A film with a lot of interesting moments but without any sort of cohesion and connection to each other, all put together for the sake of presenting itself as the 'subversive' and 'deconstructionalist' member of the franchise (which ultimately devalue these said moments; i.e. the lightsabre battles).","The Last Jedi",773,4.1,2.1

"775",3,"  WOW, WHERE TO BEGIN? THE ACTION STARTS RIGHT AWAY AFTER THE TRADITIONAL EPIC OPENING CRAWL AND WE ARE LEFT OFF WHERE THE FORCE AWAKENS WAS AT THE END. THERE ARE MULTIPLE STORIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT IT ALL ENTWINES TOGETHER TOWARDS THE END. ADAM DRIVER'S CHARACTER KYLO REN A.K.A. BEN SOLO IS DRIVEN FURTHER OF ITS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S VERY AWESOME. DAISEY RIDLEY'S CHARACTER REY IS SOMEHOW A QUESTIONABLE DEVELOPMENT. I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD BE DEVELOPED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE SHE BECOMES PERFECT. JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL ABOUT THE FORCE, THIS MOVIE EXPLORES MORE ABOUT IT AND LIKE LUKE SAYS IN THE TRAILER: ""IT'S NOT GOING TO GO THE WAY YOU THINK!"" AND IT REALLY DOESN'T. THE UNEXPECTED PART THAT EVERYONE IS MENTIONING IN THE INTERVIEW VIDEOS IS NOT JUST ONE PART BUT MANY. THE HUGE PART IS MIDWAY INTO THE MOVIE. JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK AT ALL AND IT'S VERY, VERY SURPRISING. IN ALL MY YEARS OF WATCHING STAR WARS, THE LAST JEDI TOOK A TURN TO A PATH THAT NO ONE DARED TO TAKE BUT RIAN JOHNSON DID AND HE DID THIS IN A STRANGE WAY. I THINK EVERY STORY IN THE STAR WARS SAGA ARE UNIQUE, IN THEIR OWN WAY AND I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. YES, EVEN THE PREQUELS. BECAUSE I LOVE STAR WARS. SO VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, THE LAST JEDI IS BROUGHT DOWN IN THE RANKING OF MY TOP FAVORITE STAR WARS FILMS. THERE WERE A LOT OF FLAWS AND IT'S SURPRISING THAT THERE ARE A LOT IN A STAR WARS MOVIE.THE MOMENTS IN ACH-TO PLANET, WHERE REY MEETS LUKE WHILE CHEWBACCA AND R2-D2 STAND BY AT THE MILLENNIUM FALCON ARE MY MOST FAVORITE MOMENTS FOR SURE BUT THERE WAS NO TRAINING WHATSOEVER. SO WE GET REY VENTURING INTO A CAVE TO FACE HER FEARS AND WHAT NOT LIKE LUKE DID IN DAGOBAH BUT NO REAL PHYSICAL TRAINING WITH THE LIGHTSABER. JUST FLAILING ON A CLIFFSIDE. BUT I GUESS THAT'S A THING NOW FOR LEARNING THE JEDI ARTS. THE LITTLE ALIEN BIRDS CALLED PORGS SPICED UP THOSE MOMENTS. MADE THE MOVIE A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING. THE THEME OF HOPE IS YET AGAIN EXPLORED AND IT'S A GOOD THING WE DIDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT SINCE STAR WARS DEBUTED IN 1977. BECAUSE OF COURSE, THE RESISTANCE (REBELLION IF YOU WILL) ARE BUILT ON HOPE. POE DAMERON SHOWS THE SPIRIT OF THAT THROUGHOUT THAT MOVIE. WHILE HE WAS ANNOYING ALONG THE WAY, LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THIS GUY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THE VERY THING HE'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR. WHICH IS HOPE. VICE ADMIRAL HOLDO, WHO IS PLAYED BY LAURA DERN DID A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE AND A VERY EPIC ONE, IF I SAY SO MYSELF. IT'S GREAT TO SEE AN ACTRESS FROM THE FIRST JURASSIC PARK MOVIE TO BE IN A STAR WARS MOVIE AND I LOVE EVERY MOMENT OF HER BEING ON SCREEN. HOWEVER HER DEMISE SEEMED UNNECESSARY. WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SHOOT THROUGH A FLEET OF THE FIRST ORDER. JOHN BOYEGA WHO PLAYS AS FINN AND KELLY MARIE TRAN WHO PLAYS AS ROSE TICO, THEIR CHEMISTRY TOGETHER ARE SO QUICK AND PRECISE THAT IT WAS INTERESTING FOR THE TWO OF THEM TO WORK TOGETHER. ROSE TICO'S CHARACTER CONTAINED SO MUCH SPIRIT THAT SHE MAKES ME WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH HER AND LET HER KNOW THAT SHE'S NOT ALONE. C-3PO WAS FUNNY AS USUAL AND HIS QUIRKY PERSONALITY MADE THE MOVIE FEEL STAR WARS AS USUAL. I LIKE THE PARTS WHERE HE INTERACTS WITH POE DAMERON THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE.THERE IS TWO MORE THINGS I LIKE TO POINT BEFORE I WRAP UP THIS REVIEW OF SUCH A STRANGE YET INTERESTING MOVIE: LUKE SKYWALKER AND PRINCESS LEIA. CARRIE FISHER, NO DOUBT DID A PERFORMANCE THAT WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN AND WITNESSING HER DO THE STUFF WE NEVER SEEN BEFORE WAS PRETTY COOL. ALTHOUGH HER SCENE IN SPACE AND USING THE FORCE TO FLY IN BACK TO THE SHIP IS ANOTHER QUESTIONABLE SCENE. BUT I WILL MISS HER SO MUCH AND SHE IS FOREVER THE PRINCESS OF STAR WARS. BECAUSE TO ME, SHE'S ROYALTY.AS FOR LUKE SKYWALKER. WOW, JUST WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW. INFINITE TIMES WOW. MARK HAMILL SHOWS US A SIDE THAT OTHERS HAVE NEVER SEEN BUT FOR ME THAT'S ALREADY BEEN FAMILIAR. THE WAY I ENVISION LUKE AFTER RETURN OF THE JEDI. WHERE HE BECOMES A JEDI MASTER AND BECOMES MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. HE HAS SHOWN ME MORE ABOUT THE FORCE THAN I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE OR EVEN BE OFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE. BECAUSE THEY WERE ONLY SEEN IN VIDEO GAMES, COMICS, AND NOVELS. LUKE SKYWALKER IS ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITE JEDI CHARACTERS AND HE RANKS SECOND FOR ME AND HE STILL IS. HOWEVER HIS DEMISE SCENE WAS ALSO QUESTIONABLE. I COULDN'T REMEMBER IF ACH-TO HAD TWO SUNS. EVEN AFTER A NUMBER OF TIMES I WATCH THIS WEIRD AND FLAWED MOVIE. HOWEVER, THIS MOVIE ALSO GIVES A SEND-OFF FROM CLASSIC CHARACTERS WE LOVE. SO WITHOUT A DOUBT, HIS DEMISE SCENE IS STILL GOOD ANYWAYS.STAR WARS EPISODE VIII: THE LAST JEDI IS A FAST AND THRILLING ROLLER COASTER RIDE AND IT'LL PUT YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT UNTIL THE VERY END AND I MEAN THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FLAWS IN THIS THAT I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHY OR WHAT. ALTHOUGH I DID ENJOY IT, IT IS NOT THE BEST IN THE STAR WARS SAGA.","The Last Jedi",775,4.1,1.1

"777",2.5,"  From a critic point of view, I'm surprised they rated this movie so high. TFA was not a good star wars saga movie but at least they made it well with less jokes, ok new characters and tone. This movie however was edited poorly, shot amazingly, but with no good plot and a subverting expectation chaotic 2 hours which didn't work out well for the story. Characters didn't develop, Rey became a mary sue, Finn did nothing special and from a star wars fan i would say this disrespects the saga and franchise so much.It was made better then TPM and AOTC but it's the worst star wars movie. bad jokes, bad tone, bad story and script.

The movie on its own base was very fresh and original, giving some unique twists and removing a good amount of dead weight. Snoke is definitely a huge dead weight, a second-rate emperor that felt not only extremely CGI but also took lime light away from the good characters and events such as Kylo and the rebellion.

This film just continues the creation of crap aimed at selling toys for a young generation, in an otherwise rich universe. Absolute garbage, with every imaginable cliche in the series, and some really dumb villains. The over-emphasis on emotional issues really kills me inside - it's just so bad. And the new characters?

Rian Johnson took risks and expanded on the mysticism of the force which was a huge gamble that paid off by clearing the slate for our new heros in Episode IX!Abrams has a difficult task ahead of him and doubt he will be able to eclipse the sheer brilliance of The Last Jedi!","The Last Jedi",799,4.1,-0.9

"802",1,"  While this movie was good aesthetically from a story telling standpoint it was awful. The one star was for the visuals and the musical score. This movies fails for quite a few reasons:1. Characters act out of ""character."" Any half decent writer will tell you that when you write fiction that you need to know your characters intimately. Audiences can almost always tell when a character isn't behaving like they should. There runs rampant in the Last Jedi. It makes the movie unbelievable and insincere.2. Continuity. Its Evident that J.J. Abrams had direction he started this series on. Rian Johnson did not follow that road map. 3. In conjuntion with the first item Rian Johnson does not know how to write strong characters of any stripe or creed. He purposely weakend the established stronger characters like Luke and Leia so that newer characters can shine in their own right. He even weakened Poe and Fin. A story teller should never have to weaken any characters to make other characters stronger. They are not actually stronger...they only seem stronger.4. Rian Johnson basically burned the world to the ground. The Resistance is all but defeated and left without any strong leadership with the deaths of Akbaar, Leia, and Holdo. The whole of the Resistance fits in the Falcon. On the other side of things the First Order's back has been broken. Its largest assets have been destroyed(Supremacy/Star Killer Base) and Snoke has been killed. The First Order will be in a tough financial situation and it is leaderless. Neither Kylo Ren nor Hux is fit for leadership. From reading the novel most people in the First Order want to kill those two. It will eviscerate itself before too long.5. Building on the last item I really only see two ways of moving forward. the first and most practical reason is that it has to become 4 part series. the second option is to just redo the Last Jedi","The Last Jedi",802,4.1,3.1

"815",1,"  Social Justice Wars: The Lost Jedi was even worse than The Phantom Menace. At least that movie despite Jar Jar, pod racing, bad dialogue, and little Anakin held true to the overall vision and theme of the saga. This moving was an over hyped mess.Show your continued disgust and BOYCOTT SOLO.The official critics must have been paid to produce positive reviews. This movie is garbage.Tied for second worst Star Wars movie. He did what Jar Jar couldn't do which is to completely ruin the series. It was bad. There were a few good points in it though. Rey and Kylo were utilized well. The acting, overall was good. The character development of the primary characters was good, but the secondary characters, including Luke, were either mishandled or written poorly. Below are my top 10 problems with this movie. Warning, they contain spoilers/10. Force Skype9. Virtual lightsaber battle at the end.8. Psuedo pod racing scene with animal rights angle.7. Over-the-top feminist themes intensified.6. Continued hatred and exclusions of white males in the cast, unless cast as evil.5. Snoke was a strong, strong character. Why kill him off so easily?4. Only 3 lessons of Jedi training?3. Porg.2. The movie started off as a comedy. The jokes were funny, but Star Wars is NOT a comedy.1. Leia survives being sucked out into space without a space suit on.It's not exactly as bad as the Phantom Menace, but it isn't much better. Probably on par with ATOC.Here are two additional problems with the movie.Snoke's origin and source of training/power never explained. How Luke dies.","The Last Jedi",815,4.1,3.1

"819",1,"  This movie was an atrocity. It killed 40 years of the established canon by turning Luke Skywalker into something he would never, ever do. Vader : *Killed hundreds and even had a part in blowing up a planet*Luke : ""There is still good in him.""Kylo : *Has some bad dreams*Luke : ""Better murder him in his sleep?!""The rest of the movie is just as bad.","The Last Jedi",819,4.1,3.1

"821",2,"  Star Wars: The last jedi, is not a bad movie, but it is insulting. The visual effects first off are AMAZING! However, a movie can't function on beautiful effects alone. Once you get rid of these effects and are left with the story, you might be disappointed. If you're a casual viewer, and barely know or care about the star wars lore, THIS IS FOR YOU! However, if you are an actual fan of the franchise and it's lore, you can not watch this movie, and not be disappointed. Before I watched the movie, I saw a lot of far left extremist media talk about ""Alt right"" bombing the film on here. I had a lot of good hopes for the movie, but in the end, I know it's not ""Alt right"" bombing the movie, it's far left people who have no idea of what star wars is, praising it.The big cliffhanger from the previous movie goes right off the cliff ""litteraly"" , and the big question of ""who reys parents are"" will feel you dissatisfied and insulted. What they did to Lea was insulting to the bone. However, there were great moments which I won't discuss here because I don't want to spoil it, but they felt not enough. In conclusion, this is in my opinion the most insulting star wars movie, but if you think about it as ""not really canon"" you still can have a lot of fun with it.","The Last Jedi",821,4.1,2.1
"822",0.5,"  Total garbage. Don't spend a dime on this horrible movie,","The Last Jedi",822,4.1,3.6

Why bother making a massive dreadnought if it can be destroyed by 1 bomber?..why bother making a massive capital ship if it can be destroyed by a ship engaging it's light speed engines and ramming it?..why did the rebels not do this to the death star if it was possible?. Why if Luke did not want to be found...DID HE LEAVE A MAP DETAILING HOW TO FIND HIM?; this movie manages to be not only be nonsense but actually undermines the rest of the series.","The Last Jedi",823,4.1,3.1
"824",2,"  As a huge Star Wars fan I left the Cinema after watching this feeling really disappointed. The last Jedi basically threw out every story arc created by JJ Abrams in the force awakens. Who Reys parents are, Snoke, Knights of wren all thrown in the bin for whatever reason. It was all an up yours to JJ Abrams and his story from Force Awakens, making that film pointless. Every turn this movie took I felt was a let down, trying to be different for different sake.The humour I found to be off, the film basically starts with a prank call ending in a Your Mother joke!The story is the slowest space chase in history where some random resistance leader appears instead of say Ackbar and takes over as leader while a main character is out of action, but instead of letting anyone know what her plan is, keeps it a secret for whatever reason. Making Poe the resistance hero look like a moron the whole movie as he questions what's going on, thinking a traitor is aboard.Finn was off on a pointless side quest with a new character where we can learn that animal cruelty is wrong, rich people are bad, oh and so is child slavery if you didn't know. Ending in a terrible escaping on back of animals cgi laden scene.Rey doesn't get taught anything from Luke which was such a let down. Luke was wasted badly in this film, this was not Luke we all knew from the original trilogy. Of course he would change over the years but not become what Rian Johnson created.The ending for the middle of a trilogy was bizzarre, focused on a random kid staring into the stars insinuating a new hope is born rather than focusing on the heroes of the story. It deffinately didn't have me excited about what is going to happen next in episode 9.Effects were good as you would expect and I found everyone acted well with what they had to work with. I would class this as the worst Star Wars movie so far. Because Im weak I will probably buy this on Blu Ray at some point because I'm a Star Wars nut, but I wont pre-order like I did say Rogue One which was a great Star Wars story. My negativity is coming from someone who read all the EU books before they were just legend, so my thoughts on how great the continued story could be were high, with Force Awakens not dissapointing. Unfortunately my expectations for future Star Wars has really nose dived.Rian Jonson really blew it with this one, Im not sure how JJ Abrams can pull this back for episode 9 unless he retcons multiple things from this movies story some how.","The Last Jedi",824,4.1,2.1

The movie urself wasn't the worst movie of the series, but at the end you're left with less you be excited about for the future than ever. There were scenes that may have been exciting, but for every one good scene, there were 2 bad ones. The reason posting this is because of a thought I had of why I didn't like it. Phantom menace was a worse movie, with less redeemable moments in the movie, but at the end, there was still stuff to look forward to like the eventual grown up Anikin Skywalker betraying the Jedi, obi wan, Yoda, mace windu, the Emporer's rise.... what you just saw was bad, but it'll lead to something good. Here, it's less bad, but I'm not looking forward to the future. I find the characters of Rey and Kylo to be bland. Finn is pointless, Poe is bad, Carrie Fisher is dead RIP.... there's nothing left. Kinda wish I never saw it too be honest.","The Last Jedi",832,4.1,3.6
"833",5,"  Completely unexpected and new, The Last Jedi takes Star Wars to places we've never seen before. I'm not just talking about actual locations but the tone and the ideas and the philosophy that happens in this film is beyond incredible. People will always hate good movies for reasons beyond normal people's comprehension, but this movie delivers where Star Wars has been lacking or never had in the first place. Complete masterpiece.","The Last Jedi",833,4.1,-0.9
"834",5,"  Man oh man. So incredible. I'll start with what I didn't like: I didn't like the purple-haired lady, I didn't like the alien milk scene, I think they over did Poe's rebellious nature, and did Rose and Finn really have to save all the cute animals while all their friends were about to die? BUT NOW, THE GOOD STUFF: the soundtrack oh man I listen to it every day. The costumes: brilliant! designed beautifully! Rey's slightly changed attire is wonderful! Leia's clothing is striking, elegant, strong! Kylo Ren is dressed like a legend! The cinematic beauty of it all! There were scenes that quite literally took my breath away! I was in awe! A masterpiece! The over-arching themes!! Obi-Wan hesitated to fight Anakin even after he had watched him murder children, because he believed there was still good in him. Luke hesitated to kill Vader even after Vader tortured his sister Leia, crushed planets, & wasted hundreds of Jedi lives, because he believed there was still light in him. Rey did not kill Kylo Ren because she saw Ben Solo in him, because it is the Jedi way to hold out for light, and good, and trust in the Force. Excellent! Moving! Terrific!","The Last Jedi",834,4.1,-0.9
"835",0.5,"  Star Wars by Disney has become a great sci fi line of movies, but NOT good Star Wars movies.

"838",1,"  This is not Star Wars. This is a Disney piece of shit. Thank you Disney for successfully turning the Star Wars franchise into a new Transformers franchise. Filled with dumb, cringe worthy, pathetic, un-funny one liners. There are so many things going on with so many different characters, everyone is screaming for air time, and the small amount they are given is lack lustre. There is no continuation from The Force Awakens and the plot takes you on an illogical roller coaster ride, jumping from one scene to another, just to leave the last one hanging by a thread full of unanswered questions. Too many scenes were unnecessary and the entire lore of the Star Wars universe is replaced with something I cannot even explain. It lets you down, and keeps you down in the dumps from start to finish. Different writer, different story. Don't expect a Star Wars film, expect a Disney fantasy.","The Last Jedi",838,4.1,3.1
"839",5,"  Despite the negative attention garnered through Mark Hamill's quote being manipulated out of context, I believe anyone who is a fan of the original trilogy will have to acknowledge the love of the universe the creators of this film must have had and how it shows in every moment of this installment. This is a Star Wars fan's movie through and through.","The Last Jedi",839,4.1,-0.9
"840",3,"  Some cool moments, no doubt a decent time for casual viewers, but too much good setup wasted for me to say I was satisfied. Most frustrating part of this movie was Laura Dem's character who irrationally created a bunch of conflict by keeping her plan to herself and letting Poe die inside at her decisions. Poe would have been on her side if she used a little communication, such a dumb plot point.","The Last Jedi",840,4.1,1.1
"841",3,"  This movie is decent on the surface until you notice that it really didn't continue any of the story from the force awakens. Audience left with more questions and no satisfying answers.","The Last Jedi",841,4.1,1.1
"842",0.5,"  The greatest troll film of all time. Every them, every plot thread, everything you thought you knew about Star Wars - TROLLED!If you were ever curious what it would look like if the emo/vegan kid who got teased by nerds made a Star Wars film looked like, this is the movie for you!","The Last Jedi",842,4.1,3.6

"844",0.5,"  Hey everyone, guess what? Disney's managed to destroy Star Wars!What's almost more disturbing is the realization that RT is just a place where Shitty movies get great reviews from ""critics"" who are more interested in praising leftist BS (in this case, strong, smart women vs. weak bumbling men) so prevalent in entertainment than admitting that for all intents and purposes, Hollywood Cinema is DEAD DEAD DEAD!Thanks Mickey!Good offing riddance!","The Last Jedi",844,4.1,3.6
"845",4.5,"  Very underrated sure The Movie had Flaws but after I saw this it became my new 2nd Favorite Star Wars Movie. This Film had many gripes from Fans like the way they portrayed Luke and stuff like that but I still love the movie. Can't wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray.","The Last Jedi",845,4.1,-0.4
"846",3.5,"  A sadly unpleasing sequel to Force Awakens. Almost painfully boring and to close to the prequels in terms of the useless humps of horrible obnoxious cgi characters. Not the worst star wars movie, and it wasn't THAT bad. I'd recommend it to any star wars fan.","The Last Jedi",846,4.1,0.6
"847",2,"  iN one sentence this is disappointment.Is this a bad movie? No. But it is not a good movie. As a Star Wars fun, I am disappointed. It has plot holes, misused characters, some of the worst comedy moments (not counting Jar Jar), butchers old characters at the expense of not known characters, puts two-dimensional women for sake of sticking them in, go against what we saw in previous movies (Star Wars lore), sticks ""sell-able"" toys left and right, and of course promotes lots of political agendas, which is such a shame, because some of the visuals are breathtaking, some of the concepts are interesting (albeit poorly executed), ships design, costumes, and creatures (minus Porgs) are great.But to put the question ""is this a bad movie?"" in perspective - I'd rather watch Episode 2.","The Last Jedi",847,4.1,2.1
"848",5,"  I pity you people who are STILL writing on this site on how much disdain you have for this film. I can understand it if you LOVE this amazing movie (pretty much the majority of the movie goers and fans) to continue talking about it. But to continue to dog is not only such a waste of time but so, so sad. 48% polled on this site did not like it...that's about 95 to 97, 000 out of 187,000. and if you dumbasses think that represents a majorty of fans and movie goers alike, you're simply paralyzed from teh neck up! LOL! Don't kid yours;eves, the movie rocked, it made it's money and then some...noone one person with a brain thought it was going to pull in TFA numbers so quit trying to justify your hatred by attempting to play number games of its success! And BTW, plot holes are not the equivalent to a plot you did not care for. An amazing plot with character development and growth by a first rate writer in Ryan Johnson! And if you're too stupid to recognize it, then you have no hope. For the rest of us , this film is a NEW HOPE in what this franchise needed to stay alive and relevant. Sorry you outspoken minority think you represent the whole...but you don't. Film rocks and looking forward to what's next!","The Last Jedi",848,4.1,-0.9
"849",4,"  This is not a perfect film by any means, it's filled with lots of problems, pointless subplots, bizarre character choices, and forced humor. But with all that said, for a 152 minute film, I was thoroughly entertained, was this what I expected? No but I definitely admire the film for making bold choices and taking risks that went against the usual Star Wars formula. I can definitely understand the hate this film has gotten from fans, but the stuff that's good is unbelievably good.","The Last Jedi",849,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"850",3,"  I'll give the Last Jedi the benefit of the doubt and say it's a lot better the second time viewing. Although a lot of great films will make you want to rewatch it for the satisfaction of the first viewing, the second viewing of the Last Jedi is more of a way for viewers to try and get an answer from their confused first viewing, basically.But the second time through, the jokes seem more wholesome, moments are more captivating, and I'll be honest, the plot seemed to make some more sense. Sure it's a rough and long film, but having a lot of cliffhangers and unanswered questions is a good thing to set up Episode 9.","The Last Jedi",850,4.1,1.1

"856",0.5,"  There's no possible rating I can give this movie that is sufficiently low enough. -10 million isn't enough to note just how bad this movie is and what a dump it takes on star wars as a whole. This movie killed star wars for me as a life long fan who saw the original back in the drive in movie theatre in the 70's.","The Last Jedi",856,4.1,3.6
"857",0.5,"  This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Plot holes everywhere, disjointed and contrived plot, horrible subplots, destroyed OT characters, ultimate Mary Sue, wasted character development. Just an awful movie outside of score and visuals. First star wars movie I didn't to see a second/third time in theaters, won't be purchasing on blu ray, and won't ever watch again. A disgrace in every possible sense.","The Last Jedi",857,4.1,3.6

"860",0.5,"  Critics loved this because of the countless ""virtu-signaling"" no doubt. Also a beautifully shot film with Star Wars-like scenes but it's all only surface deep. The more time I spend reflecting, the more disappointed I am. What a missed opportunity. I want to throat punch Rian Johnson!","The Last Jedi",860,4.1,3.6
"861",5,"  I understand why people don't like it as much, but honestly. I liked it, right from the beginning. After watching it multiple times it only reinforces how great I think it is. Are there parts I don't like? Yes, of course (looking at you Canto Bight), but I think on the whole, the movie didn't play it safe. It gave Star Wars fans something new and interesting. I think the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship is one of the most compelling story arcs in the whole series. He was too powerful at too young an age and the adults in his life didn't know how to deal with him. He had no one in his corner. It's no wonder he was so easily manipulated by Snoke and the dark side. But now there's Rey in his life. She will be his guiding light. She also feels like no one was ever in her corner. And the person she thought was going to step into that role (Luke) didn't. Ben was there, and he did help her. She sees the good in him and wants so badly to save him. In the end, even though they fought together, She can't stay, he won't leave, but they're connected. I ardently believe neither of them can kill the other. They're 2 sides of the same coin. I want her to help redeem him so badly in 9. I want them to dissolve the first order together, but I'm afraid the 'redeemed Skywalker' trope is too tired. Please JJ Abrams, don't ruin this for me. I like Luke's arc, as well as Poe's. I thought they both really developed as characters. Initially I really disliked Finn's story, but after multiple viewings I changed my mind. Rose and DJ are like the angel and devil on Finn's shoulders. DJ was what Finn was; Focused on saving himself. Don't join, run away. But Rose is the opposite; duty, honor, courage. He struggles throughout the movie with both sides of himself, but Rose and the resistance win him over. I'm hoping in the next movie he'll be less selfish. I don't know where they're going to take his character. Over all I thought it was a fantastic addition to the series. It wasn't perfect, but I liked that it wasn't cookie cutter. I am so excited to see what JJ Abrams brings us for 9!","The Last Jedi",861,4.1,-0.9
"862",0.5,"  Not what it was. So lame, poor story. Disthrone EP 1 by far!","The Last Jedi",862,4.1,3.6
"863",5,"  Cinematically beautiful and I love the depth they are adding to both sides of the conflict. Shades of grey rather than black and white. Can't wait for Episode IX.","The Last Jedi",863,4.1,-0.9
"864",5,"  A very surprising turn for the franchise, and a very divisive one, nonetheless, Star Wars: the Last Jedi does its best to break free of the shadow of the original trilogy and become its own thing, and it does so successfully. While many may mourn the way the original characters are sidelined in favor of this new generation, there is no denying that Star Wars is treading new waters here, and supplying fans with many new twists and turns, along with more layered storytelling and fleshed out characters.","The Last Jedi",864,4.1,-0.9
"865",5,"  I loved this movie. The characters were more fully fleshed out, the story was exciting, and most importantly, it furthered and deepened the plot of this modern trilogy. Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren, and Daisy Ridley as Rey, were both so well done, completely immersing each character with the struggles of finding his/her place in the force, and from adolescence into adulthood. The throne room scene was hands down the best light-saber fight sequence in all of Star Wars. The music was absolutely wonderful, punctuating the ebb and flow of the storyline in the masterful way Williams has done with every Star Wars movie. Most importantly, what TFA & TLJ accomplish and is so needed in Hollywood, is representation! Heroes that are women, people of color, and perhaps even of different orientations, are so important to see on the big screen. And these heroes and villains are absolutely relatable to all of us, no matter our background. This is why I hold this movie up there with one of my absolute favorite recent movies, along with Black Panther. The latter a whole other review of superb performances and characters that appeal to all generations and backgrounds. I'm shocked by it's low audience score, especially rating this below the Prequels, which were unwatchable and horrible to sit through in the theaters. TLJ will one day be looked at as the perfect bridge between TFA and #9. I will agree that I am not such a fan of the Canto Bight sequence, outside of the character development opportunities it gave Finn, Rose & DJ. It did seem excessively long. And yes, it was hard to see Luke's portrayal as less of a guide and more of an angry and forgotten hero - yet what a commentary on how we treat elders in our society. And what a journey his character traverses throughout TLJ, confronting his own demons and internalizing the importance of embracing failure. Watching the extras, including Rian Johnson's documentary ""Director & the Jedi"" as well as his additional commentary, helped me fuse all the pieces to understand his vision for this movie, and how it fits into the big picture of these characters' respective heroes journeys.I can't wait until the next movie, and have high hopes that JJ Abrams will tie up the series in a thoughtful, edge-of-our-seat, fantastic way that the Original Trilogy did for us so long ago. I am a big fan of the entire Original Trilogy, Star Wars Rebels & Forces of Destiny. Was not a fan of the Prequels or Rogue One (despite liking Jyn Erso).","The Last Jedi",865,4.1,-0.9

"869",1,"  Non-consistent with anything Star Wars. It should have been named ""Guardians of the galaxy 3"". Then it would have made more sense. The Last Jedi is a complete travesty, and for me, the title is prophetic. It means it's the last ever Jedi movie I'll ever pay to see in a theatre. Good job, Disney. I hope you got a good bunch of 7-10 years old kids to replace the millions of fans you just shit on. Boycott them, it's all the power you have, now, my fellow betrayed force believer friends. So sad...","The Last Jedi",869,4.1,3.1
"870",2,"  Honestly very entertaining, but relied too heavily on ""witty"" one-liners and critters to capture the attention of the younger crowd as well as those who played with furby as a kid. And don't even get me started on the character Rose. I'm all about women empowerment but there was absolutely no reason Po couldn't have gone with Finn. Not only is the lead character a female (again I don't have a problem with this) but also saturated this film with females taking the lead on something because men are "" power-hungry misogynistic pigs."" So in an attempt to eradicate sexism, the film just welcomes it as long as a woman is speaking up. Also the love story between Rose and Finn felt rushed and unnecessary. I'm just saying, if Finn dies in that scene saving people, the movie would have been way better. However the fight and battle scenes were enjoyable and entertaining, but not enough to cover the lack of quality character development.","The Last Jedi",870,4.1,2.1
"871",0.5,"  I started an account just to say this about the last Jedi. If you want to see a movie that a SJW, a Chinese communist propagandist and a feminist get together to make a movie and the only thing that resembles Star Wars is the title go see this movie you will love it. It shows men being submissive bitches and complete losers it will suck out every ounce of soul and hope out of the audience. It's almost like they just wantth a movie to shot on men and Star Wars and they totally accomplished that. We need to teach Disney a lesson I am boycotting all their games EA games battlefront 2 and merchandise as well the next movie I will wait till I hear reviews before I go see it all my friends agree China basically insulted Americans. I give Star Wars the last Jedi tge worst movie ever made.","The Last Jedi",871,4.1,3.6

Being middle aged at 54, I can see employment of all kinds in this movie- people need to work to survive without losing their marbles and doing time in the mental hospital or prison.

"878",0.5,"  This is the worst star wars film ever produced, possibly the worst film ever made. It is superficial where it attempts depth, it is clumsy when it attempts to be sober. It has no story to speak of, and where it is even coherent one might well wish it were not. You can see the mistakes coming a mile off, and just have to sit there saying, 'don't do it'.

"879",1,"  Full of sjw propaganda","The Last Jedi",879,4.1,3.1
"880",5,"  One of the best mid-trilogy movies I have ever seen. Rian created a world that could lead to endless possibilities in episode IX. I would highly recommend watching it more than once to recognize and appreciate the subtle direction the film pulls you in: especially the story line with Poe. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver give amazing performances, and while John Boyega was given the weakest story line he shines through. While Daisy Ridley's character was played well, manic changes in disposition and intents can leave you feeling like you've experienced whip lash (I'm looking to you salt flat scenes). How well this movie stands the test of time will be determined by how episode IX goes. If JJ doesn't tightly weave a storyline off of this one and replicates an already used story line (return of the jedi) the work Rian did to shift the universe storyline will have been useless. If something interesting can be done that directly ties into this movie then I can see the Last Jedi going down as one of the best star wars films to ever be made. Given how the Force Awakens was written I'm skeptical that JJ will be able to take Rian's vision to this conclusion, and so I'm weary of how well the last jedi will age in the franchise. Old male rights activists will never like it, but they are not the ones who will be re-watching this movie in 20-30 years. I hope JJ writes a script that can capture that depth that was presented and deliver a home run.","The Last Jedi",880,4.1,-0.9
"881",0.5,"  The people who wrote this have no relation to Starwars, they have never been fans, they have never liked sci fi, they have no passion... If you wanted to sabotage a franchise, you would hire these people, its a terrible movie, shame on Disney.","The Last Jedi",881,4.1,3.6
"882",3,"  The Last Jedi's Visually spectacular frames, composition and expertly handled special effects attempt to to make up for some questionable decisions within its narrative and is successful to some extent. Just as ""The Force Awakens"" suffered from recycled plot lines from ""A New Hope"", The Last Jedi Recycles some aspects from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" but also introduces new ideas and a interesting new exploration of the force that may not sit right with many of the beloved franchises dedicated fans. The fresh ideas that the film introduced did overall deliver a very enjoyable and visually stunning experience from its spectacular motion capture of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, to its eye popping space and light saber battle. The film dose boast some flaws such as a strange and unjustified character arc for one of the supporting characters as well as a side plot that takes us to a new planet full of corrupt wealthy characters that feels very unnecessary and almost breaks us away from the established world of the film and nearly becoming dispensable. Nonetheless the Last Jedi is a much more enjoyable experience than it's predecessor and adds to the mythology and vibrant world of Star Wars as an Effective second entry to the new Trilogy.","The Last Jedi",882,4.1,1.1
"883",0.5,"  I liked it, but the pacing was odd and some scenes could have been cut ( the milk scene) for better moments i.e they cut a scene of b88 showing finn a recording of rey saying goodbye to him like that would have added more feeling to the movie. The humor throws off the serious moments and they could have used john boyega and oscar issaac in much better ways. I thought the movie was very grim and not kid like at all. I think a better editor could have fixed 80% of what I don't like about this movie.","The Last Jedi",883,4.1,3.6
"884",1,"  The Last Jedi is so disappointing on many levels. Rian Johnson is a good filmmaker and the film is technically marvelous. But this could've been the Star Wars film we've always wanted. Instead we see one of the most beloved and iconic characters in cinema get reduced to a coward. They should have called this film Episode 8: Luke Never Leaves the Island. I was also annoyed with being beat over the head with an over the top feminist agenda. EVERY leader in the resistance is a woman... even the squad leader! Every male character is a testosterone filled idiot, a coward, or a leader in the First Order. I love strong capable female characters... but this film does not portray equality. Too long. Stupid jokes. Lame subplots. But most of all... Luke Skywalker goes out like a little bitch. Thank you, Rian. This was a huge wasted opportunity.","The Last Jedi",884,4.1,3.1

"888",3,"  I'm giving this very strong three stars because it was a good movie but not nearly as great as the Force Awakens. I don't understand why so many people are negating the Force Awakens. It brought back Start Wars in a way that George Lucas could never do. I grew up watching the first original trilogy. The prequels were difficult to stomach. I think that Last Jedi is nowhere near as bad as the prequels. I just didn't like the scene where Leia used the force in space. That scene was crap. The Yoda was scene was cool but Yoda looked odd. The entire Rose and Fin scene was terrible. I did like the beginning of the movie and fight sequences. Overall not the greatest movie but it was okay. I'm not sure if I'll buy it.","The Last Jedi",888,4.1,1.1
"889",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars movie ever. It was grear to see Mark Hamill again. What they did to Luke Skywalker is a disgrace. I could write an essay about how bad this movie is. No heart and No soul.","The Last Jedi",889,4.1,3.6

"892",0.5,"  My honest belief is that this film ranks the worst star wars film so far. And I increasingly believe that the critics who scored highly of this movie is being paid to make the rating so high. Shame on them all for being a dishonest bunch. The film doesn't make any logical sense and it feels that it is disjoined from the Force Awakens. Killing Luke in this films tell most of the audience who grows up with it ""FUCK YOU"". Old people has no place in the star wars. If you are old, you die is basically what this film is about. I am not even getting on the perspective of that ridiculous purple vice admiral. The way she executes a plan is trying to enforce the concept women are ridiculous in decision making or something else entirely, I don't know. What I do know is the plot is stupid, not logical, ill thought out. The way to fix it could be saying that she thought theres a spy on board and hence she had to keep all plans to herself but we didn't see that writing anywhere. So what actually went on that purple head, absolutely no idea. Anyway, Snoke was kind of stupid. He didn't learn from history or from himself. When you got old, you got killed by your apprentice. It might be a sith tradition but should he actually guard against this Ben Solo? And Snoke probably was the only Sith Lord who never wielded a lightsaber. Whats going on there? We had never seen the weapons he used either. There you go, such rotten stupid movies.","The Last Jedi",892,4.1,3.6

"897",0.5,"  This movie was designed to destroy all previous Star Wars canon (including the Force Awakens), and in that it has succeed spectacularly. Anyone who doubts my claim can look at the choices made in the movie. Favorite characters dying, important plot points from the previous film leading nowhere, plot holes everywhere, an idiot in charge of the Resistance after Leia is rendered comatose (Leia's force flight being the least egregious sin of this movie), and so many other things wrong. Were this country ruled by Star Wars fans (of which I am not really), Rian Johnson would be publicly caned for the crime of ruining Star Wars. I would say I'm surprised by the movie's high rating, but I'm not. Plenty of critics don't know their heads from their rumps when it comes to a good movie, and plenty of others are afraid to give the film a low review in case the Disney hit squad sues them into oblivion. All in all, worse than actual torture. If your torturer threatens you with this movie, give them what they want immediately.","The Last Jedi",897,4.1,3.6
"898",5,"  As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise, because (spoiler alert): It is!If you haven't seen the previous installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, then I highly recommend you grab some friends to watch it with and get yourself back on track. Otherwise, you will be in for a big surprise. For those who have seen it, then you know that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) makes an iconic return to the big screen and this time, with a vengeance. Luke went into hiding, undetected, to the Porg-infested island of Ahch-To to die. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has a mission to bring Luke back to fight the Resistance as war is once again brewing against the First Order. Millions of porg-encounters later, Rey finally persuades Luke to lend her his knowledge in combat, leaving Luke unsettled by the strength of her powers.This time around, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) leads the Resistance due to unforeseen circumstances. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Holdo go head to head as he refuses to follow Holdo's rules. This creates major conflict in the storyline, as some things don't necessarily go as planned during combat. We are also introduced to a new lead character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker that guards the escape pods. She bonds with Finn (John Boyega) as she takes him to her wealthy home of Canto Bight. Though, there's so much more to this planet than meets the eye.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains high and mighty, just for show. It's evident that he hides something deep within, something he cannot control - a slight hint of compassion. After a head-to-head conflict with Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), the film finally reveals who he truly is.Now that you have an idea of what the film is about, let's talk about the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes. To be quite honest, the writing has its lows. There are moments when the audience would let out an uncomfortable laugh due to the awkward, juvenile jokes that we know certain characters would never say or do. It felt somewhat out-of-touch with the Star Wars franchise, especially since they are thrown in during the most serious, suspenseful scenes. Despite that, the rest of the screenplay is groundbreaking. It gives the audience what they want and what they didn't know they needed. Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. Shooting in locations such as Ireland and Croatia, the visual effects team make it seem as though they are off in a galaxy far, far away, without straying from its natural beauty. Special effects, as always, are mind-blowing. It's nearly impossible not to fathom lightsabers being real. Top it all off with detailed costume design and award-winning acting, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.Ultimately, Star Wars: The Last Jedi exceeded far beyond my expectations, and I urge you to go out with your Jedi Knight robes and lightsabers and experience it on the big screen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 as well as adults.

"899",5,"  I'm surprised to see how divided people are on this movie. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and really enjoyed it. The more I watch it the more I enjoy it. I have a feeling that this movie will be reviewed more positively in the eyes of it audience as time goes by and people realize that the characters and plot went in a different direction to what they had imagined and that this was okay to happen.","The Last Jedi",899,4.1,-0.9

"908",2,"  Fun movie. Significant logic flaws. Biggest problem: the movie is a long commercial of toys yet to come. The length of the movie and the characters (or participants) in the movie are often there for commercial purposes. Disney still doesn't know how to make an adult movie, and they want to make their money back on the purchase from Lucas ASAP.","The Last Jedi",908,4.1,2.1
"909",4,"  Saw the film twice. 4/5 . No, it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie to me, but then neither did The Force Awakens.

"911",1.5,"  This has to be the worst Star wars movie . First of all it seems like everyone who worked on the film is not familiar or has not taken the time to really appreciate what star wars is all about . The movie has massive plot holes and doesn't seem to know where the saga left off in the last film , I mean how does the first order get so massive after just being decimated by the republic ? And how does the republic not help Lea and her group , they clearly had communication with the out side world . There is a lot of things that are wrong but godamnit why did you make Luke so unLuke like , Luke the guy who found good in the most evil villain in the star wars franchise tries to kill his nephew like WTF . I hate you Disney and Rian , you have alieneted the fans that supported the franchise all this while and for what ? , Branch diverse , feminine and progressive ? You have killed Star wars , I just hoped you wouldn't spoil Luke for us like you did Han Solo.","The Last Jedi",911,4.1,2.6

"914",1,"  What... was this movie about? What were the themes? What was the character progression? Why is the most beloved Star Wars character of all time turned into a coward? Why is he afraid of this emo kid? Who thought that completely destroying all of our favorite characters and attempting the replace them with vapid and undeveloped paper dolls? It looked pretty. I thought the sound was great. This is the first piece of Star Wars I will not spend another dime on. Do you hear me Disney? This is not how you get my money.","The Last Jedi",914,4.1,3.1

"919",0.5,"  Absolute trash city. the title of the movie should be called ""Star wars: trash city"". apparently the entire history of the canon means absolutely nothing now, and Disney has decided to ad lib the entire thing. First of all, apparently Leia is now sorceress. After three movies (four if you count her as a baby in Ep. III), several books, and many comics leia has shown zero force sensitivity, let alone the ability to survive long exposure to the vacuum of space before flyng to the safety of a distant air-lock. I mean come on! Leia literally is flyng through f****** space for the love of God. Luke turned from the hopeful hero in the original series to lazy, pussified, whiny man who draws his lightsaber on his nephew (ready to strike) without a work because I believes that Kylo Ren may be too far gone to the dark side. This is the same guy who literally, literally had his hand cut off by his estranged father and refused to kill him when he was in a fit of rage (Ep. 3). now you expect me believe this Bulls*** from Disney that he, while calm and collected, was ready to kill his nephew (whom he loved) on a whim? Once again Disney, wtf is going on? The question I really want to ask is how many blow jobs Disney had to dish out to the critics so that they would give their movie a 91%. Additionally, I think that rey is dope af. she is the baddest b**** ini all of star wars (in my opinion). But what this about having zero training and being able to lift 10 metric tons of boulders out of the way for her and her pals? I know what you're thinking; ""but wait! in this movie she trained with Luke, a jedi master"". you would correct. But to put this into context, Anakin trained from a young boy up until he turned on the jedi council to be able to do similar feats with the force. If you think that it's accurate to have rey doing that s*** after a couple days of breathing exercises you need a psychological evaluation. Another point! in ep. III yoda (I think we can all agree that he is a powerful jedi) was spinning those weird disks and throwing them at palpatine with difficulty. I'm not buying this Bs. And yoda in this movie? name any! any! literally any point throughout star wars that a force ghost physically interacted with their surrounding in the way that yoda does in this movie. yeah. you can't. If yoda can light s*** on fire why didn't he just go kill snoke himself or at least help his homies out at the end battle of this movie. Now lets talk about snoke. a sith lord so powerful that he can take someone as strong as rey and literally over power her with one hand while delivering his evil monologue. Which I would have accepted had they given even a glimpse of his abilities or his origin. Darth sideous is lucky af that snoke was just lurking in the background while he was ruling, because snoke who have made him his little b**** boy. And what is wrong with the social justice warrior bs that decided to throw in with rose? ""now it was worth it"". Excuse me, what? everyone you know and love is about to be murdered by the first order and you're taking your time to smash a casino and then take even more time to free some horse-like animal. wow. Disney is preying on people taken up by the left-wing political ideas and those are nostalgic for some old school star wars details. From now on, I will only refer to this movie as Star wars: trash city.","The Last Jedi",919,4.1,3.6
"920",1,"  This movie was a travesty to Star Wars movies. I sold all my other memorabilia and will never spend another dime on Disney star wars GARBAGE.","The Last Jedi",920,4.1,3.1
"921",1,"  A movie that made me left the theater bored, insulted, confused and hopeless. This is by far the worst Star Wars movie, and one of the worst movies period. While the prequels weren't masterpieces, they were at least fun and imaginative. The makers of this movie, since i can't believe they are that inept at moviemaking, apparently must have went out of their way to make this movie as unfun and repulsive as possible. I won't go into detail in this review, because i would basically have to comment on every single scene of the movie, from the toilet level ""comedy"" gag in the opening, to the laughable broom kid ending. It was a mess from start to finish, and I'm done with Disney's Star Wars, they have no vision for the series, or even an idea what they're doing. I won't see episode 9, i won't see Solo, and i sure as heck won't see rian's next trilogy. Star Wars ended with return of the jedi, and let's leave it at that.","The Last Jedi",921,4.1,3.1

"923",1,"  TOXIC FEMINISM, S.J.W. and ROSE, the OXYMORON who saves the animals for one day but NOT the children?....

"924",1,"  Han Solo is resting peacefully in his grave not having to be involved in this SJW train wreck","The Last Jedi",924,4.1,3.1
"925",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is the absolute worst Star Wars movie in the saga. Don't be fooled. There is no way this movie is 91% fresh, that would be like critics saying ""Batman & Robin"" is a far superior film to ""The Dark Knight"" The Last Jedi is a movie basically made out of greed. Any reality or common sense in this film is completely out the window. This movie is a horrible mess filled with plot holes, rehashed ideas, WTF moments and dumb decisions. Disney has decided to push their politics (while milking any last remaining cash from original Star Wars fans) instead of telling a good story that makes any sense within the entire Star Wars saga. The humor in the film falls extremely flat. Most of the jokes with Rey and Luke are just so brutal to watch. I feel for Mark Hamill in this one, because you can tell he hated being in this stupid film. The stupid cheesy lines of dialog in the film are as bad as any in the Star Wars prequels. Luke comments on Leia's hair? Luke and Leia (two character icons) and haven't appeared together on screen since 1983, and that's all he has to say??? The saddest thing about The Last Jedi is the total lack of respect and judgement that Disney and Rian Johnson has shown to everything that was created before it. Watching this movie is like watching beloved old friends being marched into Disney death camps. But Disney will still show Chewbacca, C3PO or Yoda for a second or two just to remind you you might be watching a Star Wars movie. This was Disney's FU to original Star Wars fans. The Star Wars magic is gone and it isn't coming back.","The Last Jedi",925,4.1,3.6

"929",0.5,"  This film breaks virtually every rule in storytelling to politicise some silly notions about societal reform and methodically sets about destroying the very canon which it tried to use as a springboard for their ideology. I never thought that ""I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating.."" Could be made to look like compelling writing but here we are. I was upset about what was done to Star Trek, but this is a much higher level in perversion of canon.","The Last Jedi",929,4.1,3.6

"933",0.5,"  Edited review. Sorry, for some reason everything is coming in caps??? sorry!!Firstly, to the guy who keeps saying make it one star or more... If it was going to make a difference that 48% would have moved by now. Frankly, the RT % is falsified, it is not a real number. Which says all sorts of things about the authenticity of this site. Simply put: Shame on you RT.This foolishly made film was more a transparent join the dots political manifesto than a coherent story. while one can understand someone with a political agenda making a pitch to 'sell' the feminist / anti capitalist concept, the fact that it was green lighted, and then the fact that it was accomplished so ham-fistedly really makes you wonder about those with decision-making responsibility at disney.I am one that thinks TFA set up the rest of a trilogy on a shaky footing (why make han and leia estranged, for example / why kill han / why make another giant space gun / why cast an emo as a villain). Be that as it may, rian johnson ruined any chance f this trilogy having any kind of satisfactory pay off. iconic characters were disposed of at a whim, new and stupid laws of the force were introduced, and what could have been a subtle addressing of diversity and gender equality in the SW universe were handled in a laughably embarrassing manner. it fells like it was written by an angst-ridden 18 year old gender-studies student with a chip on their shoulder.Oh, and when circumstances dictated that we had the perfect way to farewell poor carrie, that can was just kicked down the road.Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself and if he was railroaded into making a political statement by kennedy, then he needs to grow a paid and defend himself.I am ashamed of everyone involved in this movie with the exception of mark hamill. Good on him for calling out the absurd story and then being a pro and going through with it.","The Last Jedi",933,4.1,3.6
"934",1.5,"  El peor error en la vida es vender los derechos de autor a Disney. Un fiasco total, deprimente, aburrida, sobreactuada.","The Last Jedi",934,4.1,2.6
"935",1,"  Spaceballs 2 the death of a franchise. This movie is a utter disgrace. Disney you are a disgrace. Tomatoes you are at it. 48 % for a month now come on? Johnson you are a complete clown. If you thought this was bad check out the deleted scenes on YouTube. Scottish dance music in a star wars film? You're a plumb. Storm troopers with deep southern us accents arse slapping. Is this guy got mental attributes of a 10 year old? Congratulations all the best franchises are butchered. Aliens, predator, terminator and now Star Wars. This guy is gonna direct the next trilogy. You haven't told me anything in the last 2 movies. You should be giving people their money back it's false advertising it's not a Star Wars movie you hacks","The Last Jedi",935,4.1,3.1
"936",2.5,"  I hate that Luke becomes a grumpy old man and dies at the end he is the chosen one for Pete's sake! I hated the hole casino scene, rose seemed very thrust into it all, and they could have done so much more with Snoke!all in all, it does not compare to Rouge One.","The Last Jedi",936,4.1,1.6
"937",4,"  I don't understand why this movie got so many bad reviews. It is a good sequel to a wonderful series. It's not going to be some cult classic, but as a star wars film it passes the torch to rey and kylo just fine.","The Last Jedi",937,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"939",0.5,"  One of the most disappointing experiences I have had in a long time, and by far the worst one in the Star Wars universe. Visually, it was pretty, and well designed, except for the moronic bombers and ""speeders"" They simply make zero sense in a sci fi context. The tempo was completely off, right from the very beginning when the first order is portrayed as buffons rather than establishing credibility as the ""big bad"" This destroyed immersion for me right from the getgo, and the incoherent scripting was never able to regain suspension of disbelief. Jokes are fine and great, but should be used to break continued, high levels of tension, here, they opened with jokes that failed to land, and never managed to establish tension. The story ""progressed"" with leaders scapegoating in order to emasculate Poe, and show ""powerful"" characters by tearing other characters down to show their superior value. All this comes free, with a plot so disturbingly full of holes it appears to be a paper researched and written the night before it was due. This plot disrespects physics, and especially logical thought and intelligent tactics so much that it was not possible for me to get into the film.Suspension of disbelief is critical for getting moviegoers to overlook or forgive technical oversights.. but film never came close to establishing enough credibility, and has a HUGE number of logic failures that require forgiving. Overall.. it was pretty.. but the writing was horrific, and kept delivering one insult after another. The story was never gripping, tense, nor entertaining, leaving my most frequent thought during the film as ""are you f*$#@ng kidding me?""","The Last Jedi",939,4.1,3.6
"940",0.5,"  This film ruined Star Wars for me. I have been a Fan for almost 20 years, loved the movies, the books and video games... HATE The Last Jedi. The Sequel Trilogy has nothing better to do than to burry all of your Childhood Heroes because ""the young audience wants to see the older generation pass the torch to a younger generation""... really? This film is worse than Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace combined.","The Last Jedi",940,4.1,3.6

"943",5,"  Led by charismatic performances from Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, Ready Player One is proof that Steven Spielberg is still going strong. It combines state of the art special effects, a simple yet heartwarming story, and more pop culture references that anyone could possibly count in the best way possibly, and features the single greatest large-scale battle I've ever seen put to film. It's not perfect, but it might be the single most fun movie of 2018 so far.","Ready Player One",943,3.5,-1.5
"944",2,"  If tou have not read the book this isn't a bad movie. I did read and loved the book and was excited to see the movie. However the movie diverged from the book quite a lot in my opinion and too much was lost in attempt to fit the storyline into a single movie. It has be generisized for hollywood. There was not enough character development which made the emotions feel forced. There was so much potential for this movie and I think the squandered it. It should have been a trilogy. I don't think this will be a movie I will watch more than once.","Ready Player One",944,3.5,1.5

"952",4.5,"  Ready Player One is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Simon Pegg, T.J Miller and Ben Mendelsohn.It tells the story Based on the Ernest Cline's 2011 novel of the same name, in the not to distance future, where the planet is pretty much mess up. When one James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and his partner Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) create the first virtual reality world called the Oasis, it becomes an instant success. It's a place in which you can be anyone and do whatever you want and the perfect place to escape the awful world.After parting ways with his business partner, Halliday runs the company alone and when he finally dies years later, he releases his final challenge to the world. He tells people across the globe that he has placed an Easter Egg deep within the Oasis and whoever finds it will inherit all of his assets and the Oasis itself. Of course, to find it, you have to first find three keys, or clues, to unlock the egg's precise location, and it's no easy task.Set in Columbus, Ohio, we meet Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), a young man who lives in the Stacks. A trailer park from hell, Wade has a pretty miserable existence in the real world. But he finds solace in the Oasis as his cool avatar Parzival, hanging with his avatar pals and desperately trying to crack Halliday's challenge. When Wade/Parzival meets Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), his entire game and life changers.The performances are all top-notch, especially from Sheridan and Cooke, who gel well together onscreen. Cooke particularly is engaging when she's being her avatar Art3mis, full of cute swagger and confidence. Ben Mendelsohn chews it up with the best of them, and it's perfectly fine for him to go over the top. Other standouts include the always-good Mark Rylance, as the sweet, kind-hearted, geeky moral centre of the film.The true star of the film, however, is the Oasis. It's simply the place to be, especially through Spielberg's visual mind. No offense to the actors, but you are instantly sucked in the minute any of the characters put on their VR goggles, and you're completely engrossed in the action sequences. The sights and sounds are nothing short of amazing, and you can actually feel Spielberg just giddily revelling in all the high-tech visuals he can create.The film is also an ode to the 1980s, Ready Player One spoke to me on many levels. I felt like it was made for me. Author Cline co-wrote the script with Zak Penn, and the two are kindred spirits, stuffing the film full of that era's references. So is Spielberg, to some degree, because it's in the late '70s and '80s when the director perfected his craft.It's not just the '80s being represented in the Oasis, but a number of great pop culture references, from beloved characters like the Iron Giant to King Kong and so much more. Ready Player One could be one of those movies that can appeal to just about everybody, even younger audiences who should appreciate the high-tech gadgetry and modern-day gamer mentality.Penn and Cline have craft a narrative that isn't necessarily surprising in its set-up but grabs you nonetheless, and while the film does seem to drag a little the closer we come to the climax, along with some characters sadly unused, Ready Player One is a Triumph.","Ready Player One",952,3.5,-1

"954",5,"  I saw this in 3D imax, which was AMAZING. Being 3D, it was like being in the virtual reality right along with the characters. The story was simple enough to follow and challenging enoug to provoke contemplation. It was neither a drama, action, romcom, or horror movie. It was all of them. This was as well rounded, innovative and visually stunning as avator. HIGHLY recommend.","Ready Player One",954,3.5,-1.5

"963",3,"  An action adventure geared towards younger audiences that faills far below the expectations created by the book. The movie makers said ""show me the money,"" and delivered a fast paced video game, that while hitting the major plot points, lacked the gravity of human issues, world building, and character development that makes the book great. Would have rather had a series of movies that told the story well, than one rushed movie that fit into a one movie made to appeal to the commercial masses.","Ready Player One",963,3.5,0.5

"965",3.5,"  To be honest I like the plot, it is easy to understand but when I asked friends about the movie they barely remembered it not to say it wasn't memorable but they actually spent more time searching for references to other franchises which I'm going to admit, watching a Gundam fight Mechagodzilla gave me a total nerdgasm.","Ready Player One",965,3.5,0
"966",4.5,"  Ready Player One was a fun movie. While I had not read the book, my friend who had said it was totally different but still a good movie. I enjoy CGI when the story supports it, which this totally did. the acting was good, tbe story good though a little predictable, but still a lot of fun. The movie trailer does not do the movie justice; the movie is better than the trailer suggests.","Ready Player One",966,3.5,-1

"969",5,"  Honestly, probably the best movie I've seen in a while. It was a thrilling, hilarious adventure that made 2 hours seem like 30 min. I wanted more. The best part was the references to about 90% of my fandoms. I will own this movie when it comes out, and I will watch it more than once. Well done, Spielberg. Well done.","Ready Player One",969,3.5,-1.5
"970",1.5,"  I was excited for this movie as i really enjoyed the book but... plain and simple i found it rather bad. Many of the plot lines from the book are are either skipped or done away with all together. The characters are misrepresented e.g. in the book Aech is described as a ""athletic Caucasian heterosexual male""(ch. 33) but in the movie he is some sort of robotic ogre person In the end despite the movies over 2 hour run time it felt rushed. I feel that this movie would be more enjoyable if the audience member has NOT read the book and has no intention of doing so. Either watch the movie or read the book or do both and face disappointment.","Ready Player One",970,3.5,2
"971",3,"  I know its not always fair to compare the book with the movie, but sometimes its hard not to and in this case, it strayed REALLY far from the source material. As a movie, it was pretty good and the visuals were really good. If I had not read the book, I think I would have loved it, but the book is WAY better. And it seems odd that Steven went that far out of the way to change so many details from the book. But a good watch nonetheless.","Ready Player One",971,3.5,0.5
"972",1,"  This review is full of spoilers. You have been warned. We all remember that amazing feeling. We get home from school, run into the living room, boot up our console and wait for our favorite game to load. As it turns on, we get ready to battle, and the game lets us know it's time as those familiar words flash before our eyes: ""Ready Player One.""You would think a movie that was called ""Ready Player One"" would at least include those beautiful words the very first time our protagonist, Wade Watts, logs into the Oasis, right? Well, not so much.In a movie literally called Ready Player One, there wasn't much emphasis on actual gaming. This is the very first place where this movie goes so terribly wrong. Alright, but let's back up a bit. Ready Player One is based on the best-selling Ernest Cline novel of the same name. This dystopian book is set in a post-apocalyptic America in the not so distant future. The basic background we get at the beginning of the book is that our world has gone to shit. In the year 2044 the world has been facing an energy crisis for decades that was caused by global warming, overpopulation, and the depletion of fossil fuels. Basically, the world was destroyed by...humans. Rather than doing something to fix the problems they caused, humans escaped into a world of virtual reality, and began to live, work, and even get married to people they have never actually met, all inside the MMORPG called, The OASIS. The world is going to hell, but the OASIS is actually fairly stable. The OASIS has its own government, where Wil Wheaten is President, and the OASIS currency is actually much stronger than any you could get in real life.However, things get interesting when James Halliday, the reclusive creator of the Oasis dies, leaving behind no heir to inherit his vast fortune, and control of his company and all of the OASIS. So, Halliday leaves behind an Easter Egg in his game. Anyone who finds it, will win his entire estate, and the right to run the OASIS.The problem is, the company IOI is after the OASIS for profit. Nolan Sorrento, IOI's CEO, wants to make players charge for the right to access the OASIS. Since the world has basically been destroyed and a very small percentage of people control the world's tangible wealth, the only good thing most people have in their lives is the OASIS.Okay, so why I am giving you this vast background on the book? It's to highlight one of the biggest problems in the film adaptation of the novel. THERE ARE STAKES. The action of this story is fueled by the fact that if IOI gains control of the OASIS there will be no more reason for most of the world's population to even want to keep living. Most people work inside the Oasis, so if they have to pay a monthly fee just to get to work, what chance do they ever have of getting ahead? In the book, most people are starving because there is literally not enough food left on earth. This novel is brilliant, but I obviously knew there was absolutely NO WAY this movie would be able to replicate the epic quest laid out in the books pages, but I had really hoped that the spirit of the story would remain intact. In fact, I couldn't find anything in this movie that reminded me of the source material. There are serious spoilers ahead, so continue reading with caution.In the book, it was important to Halliday that a student find the first key. He wanted a regular person to begin this journey, so to start the movie with Wade already being this amazing Gunter, with amazing weapons, and a freaking DeLorean immediately made me feel like I wasn't connected to his character. He was clearly not a regular guy. Also, making Wade, Aech, and Art3mis go to school adds that human element that is missing from the film. People still have to have lives. They have to go to school or work. I mean yes, they go to school in the OASIS, fine. But they still have the expectation to do the boring monotonous things in life. It would have made the movie feel more real. It also, again, would have added additional stakes. ""I can't find the egg and save the OASIS from IOI until I finish school, otherwise I'll get kicked out of school and lose my internet access, gloves, and goggles to access the OASIS.""Also, I felt cheated that the movie picked up in the middle of the hunt. They dismissed whoever it was that figured out the first clue was a race...except.... how did they figure it out? It made NO sense that it would be a race based on Halliday's first clue, and it felt like cheating to skip over that.Then there is the fact that the spirit of the quest was completely altered in this adaptation. The quest itself should have felt like an adventure, but it was just a series of random events that led to a key. I mean, I obviously wanted to see Parzival Joust for the key against Acererak - but if that wasn't possible in the movie for whatever reason couldn't we have at least flavored the challenge to be similar? Spielburg used a flashy car chase because he wanted to be flashy. It wasn't about storytelling, it was about special effects. The quest for each key felt so lazy and figuring out the challenge was so easy for everyone that once again, there were no stakes. I get it, it was a race to beat IOI, but it should have been about so much more.In the book, IOI has castle Anorak encased in the Orb of Osuvox for like a month while the other Gunters hurried to figure out the last clue and catch up, but Sorrento and his band of Sixers (Suxors, as the book called them which would have made for an entertaining addition to this movie) couldn't figure out how to use the key and get past the gate because it never occurred to people so greedy to work together. IOI only used the Cataclyst to blow up the planet after Parzival and his friends showed them how to open the gate. I mean, that's an actual reason why IOI would destroy so many of its own Avatars. It wasn't just because Sorerento was throwing a hissy fit. That's also high stakes. IOI had a month, alone with the key and they couldn't figure it out. Let's address some other issues with the movie. Firstly, how the hell was it so damn easy for everyone to find each other? Daito and Shoto are in Japan in the book, which gives a broader scope to the story. This isn't a book about America, it's a book about the world. Also, Wade would have NEVER just told all of his friends how to find the first key. It's so dumb that the movie copped out like that. It goes against everything his character stood for, which is why it made more sense that Daito and Shoto don't meet Parzival, Art3mis, and Aech until after they find the key for themselves. This is where the movie continues to lack a human connection. Life just doesn't work this way. People don't all just magically find each other, and the entire freaking world is not based in Ohio. It's just...ugh. Let's get to Arti for a minute. In the books, saving the OASIS is the most important thing there is. She kind of hates that Z just wants to take the money and run. She wants to save the OASIS so she can use the money, the power, and the resources to save the world. She wants to feed people, get them into safe housing, and clean up the streets. She fights off Wade's attraction because she cannot afford to get sidetracked. Even at the end, when they are in the same house, she refuses to meet him in person until one of them has the egg. It's too important to let her emotions compromise what she views as the fate of the planet. That's a great character. She is driven, smart, complex, scared...she is real. Arti in the movie is flat. She dumps Z, but then...just kidding, ""I was really just coming to find you all along."" The fact that they meet so early in the movie takes away something so beautiful. It takes away the longing, the fight for their relationship, and the eventual terror he feels when he finds out her life is in danger. Also, that whole, ""I'm gonna fall on my own sword and be captured because you are the only one who can save the Oasis"" shit she pulls in the movie is so dumb. She would have been like, ""try to keep up, fool.""And why does EVERYONE just bow down to Wade and act like he is the only one who can win for the entire movie? I mean, racing against the Sixers is good, but why can't you also be racing against each other? It just would have made a much more interesting story.Getting back to my argument that there were no stakes in this movie, let's talk about Daito for a moment. His death in the book changes the entire dynamic of the hunt, and the race to beat the sixers. Daito dies, IRL, at the hands of IOI and that changes everything. I mean, we already knew Sorrento was capable of this, but for him to actually murder a member of the High Five is a wakeup call. It changes the way Wade views the entire quest and is probably what makes him allow himself to get arrested by IOI (under a fake name) and use his resources as an ""employee"" (with the help of some sweet hacker backdoor codes) to take down the Orb protecting Castle Anorak. Speaking of which, how the hell was it so easy to get out of IOI? I mean, Arti got her detector and alarm off easily enough...fine. Let's ignore that. But then she breaks into Sorrento's office unnoticed, gets out just as easily, then goes into the IOI war room, kills other sixers USING A SIXER AVATAR, and nobody thinks to take off their damn helmet and find the Sixer who is killing them all? Also, literally everyone is looking for her and they don't realize she is still inside IOI headquarters. You got drones that can find a dude with a face tattoo in five minutes, but you don't have security cameras in your headquarters? Seriously? Also, she is in a Sixer Suit, using a Sixer account, wearing a Sixer uniform. So how do we see her inside the Oasis as her own avatar. That is ridiculous. This is where I will address the movie fails in even following its own rules. Early on, it is established that to run and move your own body in the Oasis, you need a Haptic Suit. So how the hell are people just running around in the streets in Cleveland, wearing regular clothes, but still somehow shooting at everyone in the Battle for Castle Anorak? It makes no sense.Also, I challenge you to run around a busy street, with your eyes covered, pretending to be battling someone, and not get yourself run over by a bus. This is not real life, people. I think the actors were fine. They seemed well cast and may have been good if they had been given better writing. I mean, come on with this one. ""I won't be like Halliday. I'll jump."" Wade says, as he kisses, Samantha. I mean...really? That's the best you have. My friend groaned out loud in the theater with that one.The actor who played Halliday did a nice job, and so props to him, but Simon Pegg was painfully under utilized as Ogdon Morrow. I think I would have given the entire movie a break if they had allowed him to be the one who saves Z and Arti in the nightclub by using his overly strong, immortal OASIS avatar, ""The Great and Powerful Og."" That scene in the book was amazing and was 100% the reason why I was excited about Pegg's casting in this film. Also, I liked that it was Og who got the kids to safety in the end. He was so disgusted at the evil way IOI was twisting Halladay's challenge, that though he wouldn't interfere with the game, he also wouldn't let the kids get murdered. Stakes. We keep coming back to that. I wanted to like this film. I really really wanted to, but in the end, I didn't enjoy it at all. It focused 100% on special effects and failed where movies matter most: In the telling of a story and creation of characters the audience actually cares about.","Ready Player One",972,3.5,2.5
"973",5,"  I loved the movie and it was amazing incredibly amazing the only two things is I wanted to see WAIT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT okay I wanted just o see tracer from overwatch shake hands with the Scout from Team Fortress 2 as they attack the shield and the guards I also wanted to see As everyone was attacking the shield and troopers I wanted to see a trooper look down and see a Uganda knuckles and he Spits on the trooper and then a bunch more Uganda knuckles come and spit on him and he just dies from the spit it would be funny but other then that it's a great movie go watch it","Ready Player One",973,3.5,-1.5
"974",4,"  I thought this was great. A little flawed, but still great. It just appeared that Spielberg really wanted to make Avatar, Lord Of The Rings, another Kubrick film, and everything else, and did just that in one movie. Still fun to see everything whizzing by though.","Ready Player One",974,3.5,-0.5

"979",1.5,"  Didn't care for it. the graphics weren't that good, the jokes weren't funny, the story wasn't very engaging, the story had moments that were way too convenient, and the plot kind of just broke into pieces at the end.","Ready Player One",979,3.5,2

"983",4,"  Ready Player is a solid movie with likeable characters and lots of nostalgia. Familiar faces I know of from video games are super cool to see and Spielberg placed them and used them well. I liked it.","Ready Player One",983,3.5,-0.5
"984",4,"  Ready Player One is almost like a cinematic sci-fi love letter to hardcore fans of 80's and 90's gaming, pop culture, movies, books, etc. And to an extent, a message to Generation X, Millenials, and generations beyond. It is a beautiful virtual world (like Tron: Legacy and Wreck it Ralph) built within the ""real world"" that could actually be one of mankind's possible futures. Now I've never read the source material but the film on it's own is just amazing. The CGI action is very good and the easter eggs are boundless, there will be something current or nostalgic here for everyone at some point that will touch your heart. While the visuals are great, there is a mystery, treasure hunting adventure here (and some romance) with a background of a very ultra materialistic (digital and physical) future for humankind. The plot is engaging enough that you almost forget that most of the world is now ""plugged in"" and escapes reality as much as possible. This itself will bring much discussion amongst your friends. I for one, would have loved if we could see more of the outside world. Just like you had to watch E.T., the first Jurassic Park or Star Wars, Indiana Jones or even Avatar; This movie has to be seen. Give it a shot, especially in IMAX 3D lol. Final Review: 9.5 out of 10","Ready Player One",984,3.5,-0.5
"985",2.5,"  There are better and easier ways to watch a man jack his meat for 2 hours. Ready Player One relies on references as a crutch to support a stale story.","Ready Player One",985,3.5,1

"990",3.5,"  I can't say if this movie sticks close to the book, but I will say it was a fun journey, overall. The movie relied heavily on the 80s nostalgia but they did so in a charming way. Only time will tell if it holds up in the future.","Ready Player One",990,3.5,0
"991",1,"  Absolute abomination.Does not stay true to the book, it misses out all the best points in the story line and all the 80s culture /film/TV and music references. Spielberg has turned a geeky, interesting and clever book into a complete nonsense action film.Seriously disappointed in this film that I had been awaiting to see for a long time!","Ready Player One",991,3.5,2.5

"994",5,"  I created an account to rate this movie and Im 32. I hadn't read the book, and I'm sure the only true issue I have with the movie would be somewhat resolved in a novel. The only issue I held with the movie was the villain of the movie (IOI headed by a pretty typical protagonist). Other than that, the movie had me very engaged, and thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Given some time, I could probably come up with other plot holes and issues, like Ogg not already knowing how many references there were to his late wife in the archives, the villain giving away his plan to blow up Wade's house. Not to mention he hires a dude to do a job and blatantly tries to ruin his Bounty Hunter's plan. Either way, this movie gets a 5/5* stars from me and that's because the ending was absolutely perfect, and It truly gave a new feeling to what felt like a ride through a new world's Willy Wonka, with just as good of an ending with a message that should reach a digital audience on a personal level. *would give it 4/5, but I feel it deserves more than a simple 80% for an audience score. As I type this it was at 80%.","Ready Player One",994,3.5,-1.5
"995",4.5,"  I just saw 'Ready Player One' in IMAX 3D, and as of right now this is by far my favorite Sci-fi movie of all time! I love the visuals/animation, the sound was awesome, and this was certainly an Easter Egg hunt for me. Overall, I give this film a 9/10.","Ready Player One",995,3.5,-1
"996",4.5,"  A few significant departures from the book were taken in translating this story to the silver screen but overall it was done well and while the weakest link in my opinion in the movie are the two lead ""evil"" characters the rest of the screenplay tracked well to make for a fun and sweet movie with a wonderfully nostalgic soundtrack.","Ready Player One",996,3.5,-1
"997",5,"  This movie is a nostalgic blast from beginning to end. Needs to be seen on a big screen and more than one time to catch all the references.Not gonna spoil anything, needless to say you will not be disappointed!","Ready Player One",997,3.5,-1.5

"1005",5,"  This movie is just absolutely stunning. It's like watching 2 movies at once with the shining part. This movie is also filled to the brim with Easter eggs so that you can try and spot them out.","Ready Player One",1005,3.5,-1.5
"1006",4.5,"  Ready Player One was a movie I didn't really have high hopes for, but was I pleasantly surprised. Spielberg was able to combine pop culture references and dozens of movies and games to create a fun movie to please the nerd inside of us.","Ready Player One",1006,3.5,-1
"1007",4.5,"  Loved the film, Great storyline and characters. As a gamer since the age of 7 I saw a lot of easter eggs in the film and loved how they managed to get them put in there. Also some true stories from gaming history.","Ready Player One",1007,3.5,-1
"1008",1.5,"  Only followed the Plot summary of the book. Left out so much detail and information that made the book so awesome. Redbox at best. Not worth a trip to the theatre.","Ready Player One",1008,3.5,2
"1009",4,"  Since the dawn of the Atari age man has searched for a decent video game movie. But in all those years there has only been one success, which succeeded because it was about video games rather than based on one. And now Steven Spielberg has built on that formula to create a true classis for the gamer generation.The first thing that strikes you is that this is an absolutely gorgeous movie. Avatar or Valerian level gorgeous. The character designs, worlds, and massive battles within the Oasis are well beyond anything that could be produced in the real world, and that's the point. Even non-gamers will understand the allure of spending your time and money in a place as wonderous and boundless as this. From a technical standpoint, the motion capture is state of the art and the textures and particle effects luscious. I wish the graphics on my PC could be this good.The pacing is fast and lean, and the action scenes breathtaking. There are shootouts, jaw dropping race sequences, and beautifully choreographed fight scenes- some of which spill over into the real world. And the final battle on Planet Doom is beyond even Peter Jackson's best. It occurred to me more than once that this movie is like the ultimate Twitch stream, only without the creepy commenters or expectation of tipping.This is a movie that more driven by action than acting, but I especially liked Ben Mendelsohn as slimy gaming company CEO Nolan Sorrento. He exudes a palpable aura of arrogance and self-importance. He's ruthless, scheming, somewhat megalomaniacal, but above all deeply frustrated that these kids keep inconveniencing him by thwarting his evil schemes. Evil schemes that aren't that different from some of the industry's more abusive practices today. It's not very hard to imagine this guy as the head of EA, trying to bluff his way through a Q&A at E3.And of course, there are the Easter eggs. Enough eggs to fill hundreds of baskets, or whatever the digital equivalent is. Loot crates? Bags of holding? Whatever. The point is virtually every popular or cult movie, TV show, and video game of the last forty odd years is referenced, along with some much older. It would take dozens of viewings- or help from the internet- to spot them all. I know I haven't. What's particularly interesting is that many of them are plot relevant, because the story is about parsing subtle references to find the egg that will grant admin privileges for the OasisThe biggest criticism leveled at this movie is that it's rather shallow for a Spielberg production. Perhaps there's some truth to that. It certainly doesn't have the depth of Schindler's List, Munich, or even Jurassic Park. But then Jaws and Tintin weren't exactly cerebral either. And Player One does make for an interesting commentary on both the positive and negative social aspects of video games and the internet, even if it's not explored as fully as it could have been. And it's honestly quite refreshing that in a movie about virtual reality, the moral of the story is that you have to unplug and live in the real world some times.So Ready Player One isn't Spielberg's deepest movie, or his best. But it just might be his most fun.","Ready Player One",1009,3.5,-0.5
"1010",5,"  More then just a video game movie. Might have even forced gamers like myself to take a long hard look in the LCD screen.","Ready Player One",1010,3.5,-1.5

"1012",5,"  I went to go see this in imax and it kept me on the seat of my chair,I enjoyed how the movie was kept relevant to a path we may be going down ourselves.

"1014",5,"  I see a lot of movies. I am not a professional, I am just a geek. Having said that, I loved this movie. They managed to do a good job of mixing the virtual world with real world and making the danger be in both worlds. It was very well thought out. I was skeptical at first, I am not a fan of dystopian society movies, however it was very good. Of course it would be a Steven Spielberg movie. He only does good movies. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that he has made that wasn't good. He is just a great story teller. Very talented and seems to think outside the box. They say that Hollywood doesn't have any good ideas left. I think Steven still has a great deal to offer the world. This movie was awesome.","Ready Player One",1014,3.5,-1.5
"1015",4,"  Great film. Think I liked it more because I had no expectations for it but had a lot of fun watching it. 4/5","Ready Player One",1015,3.5,-0.5
"1016",3,"  Read the book. The movie does a good job building the world and then quits before developing characters or plot. It also eschews the most trenchant cultural criticism. For what I assume are legal reasons, it narrows the worlds of characters it inserts, sticking with the Warner Brothers and Amblin properties. Other decisions shorten the story line, reduce the proportion of time spent in virtual reality, and make the movie acceptable to a wider audience. And others are probably a combination of all these. We're left with a team without the team-building, internal conflict without depth, and cultural criticism without much reflection. This is one of Spielberg's competent contributions, not a triumph.","Ready Player One",1016,3.5,0.5
"1017",2,"  A beautifully boring ride.It was really interesting to look at and experience, and some of the cameos were exciting to see. But, none of the characters came across as real people, the love story felt very contrived, and the main character never had a crisis of faith in himself or internal conflict. He came across as overly capable for each situation and almost impossible to relate with.","Ready Player One",1017,3.5,1.5
"1018",5,"  Best gaming and nostalgia movie ever!","Ready Player One",1018,3.5,-1.5
"1019",2,"  A haphazardly reconstructed version of the book meant to be compressed not just for a film's length, but for a short attention span. Visually fun and light, but weak in adapting a film-ready book.","Ready Player One",1019,3.5,1.5
"1020",5,"  best movie this year so far !","Ready Player One",1020,3.5,-1.5
"1021",4,"  A normal story with fantastic visual impacts and cultural conferences.","Ready Player One",1021,3.5,-0.5
"1022",2.5,"  Watching this movie after reading the book left me with the feeling of being scammed. Sure the general plot was loosely the same but the characters were different and the competition was completely different. I felt like the screen writers based this movie off the cliff notes they read as this movie is not the same. Perhaps the kindest way I can describe it is that the movie was inspired by a conversation the writers had with someone they talked to who read the book. If I had not have read the book the movie would be a 4.5 out of 10 as the story was choppy and characters interactions felt forced. I'm not sure who dropped the ball but I think Spielberg lost his magic with the last Indiana Jones.","Ready Player One",1022,3.5,1
"1023",5,"  So good! I felt 12 again.","Ready Player One",1023,3.5,-1.5
"1024",5,"  Spielberg isn't into making sequels and they way he adapted the book into this movie speaks volumes!...the movie is fun, a fresh journey and at all times it's an experience unlike other movies... Spielberg at his best. Loved the book and I Love Spielbergs adaptation.","Ready Player One",1024,3.5,-1.5
"1025",4,"  Spielberg manages to capture his magic again. Slick, faithful to the book and full of so many pop culture references it may warrant a second viewing. Eighties junkies will lap it up and its great to see so many different franchises mashed together. I really enjoyed it.","Ready Player One",1025,3.5,-0.5
"1026",5,"  Absolutely incredible !","Ready Player One",1026,3.5,-1.5
"1027",4,"  If you expect a 1/1 of the book, save your time (if you have payed just a little attention you should know that has never been the plan)! But if you liked the universe Ernest Cline created and are in love with Spielberg's adventure movies PLEASE do not hesitate to see this! Is it a masterpiece? No... But I will guarantee you will be entertained. If not by the story, then by the breathtaking OASIS-universe! And I'm sorry but who the F*** can argue with a shitload of references from some of the most iconic and popular movies and games of all time?!One thing is for certain... I will go watch the movie again while it's in the cinema! And I NEVER see a movie twice until it goes on VHS/DVD/BRD/UHD. FIN","Ready Player One",1027,3.5,-0.5
"1028",3,"  The CGI imaginary word of the Oasis is better realised than the 'real' world of 2047 but it's fun to spot the Easter Eggs from the word of films - although most are signposted rather than hidden. Popcorn.","Ready Player One",1028,3.5,0.5
"1029",1.5,"  Boring formulaic hokey Spielberg crap. Just a lot of CG and loud noise with silly cliches and ""duh"" moments. A forgettable weekend movie for kids who don't live in the real world.","Ready Player One",1029,3.5,2
"1030",3,"  Not a bad movie, but it definitely left much to be desired. I enjoyed the references however sometimes it seemed too forced. While it was a complete, okay movie, it wasn't fun,","Ready Player One",1030,3.5,0.5
"1031",4.5,"  While Stephen Spielberg's film adaption of Ready Player One does not reflect the book completely, it still holds true to the same backbone of the story. The film changed the way you could win the keys completely from the way it is done in the book, but this isn't likely to make it more understandable and less confusing to the general public. Even though this is going down as one of my favorite movies, it could of been split into multiple to better tell the story instead of cramming everything into a couple hours. I recommend you check out Ready Player One.","Ready Player One",1031,3.5,-1
"1032",5,"  Great Video Game Movie","Ready Player One",1032,3.5,-1.5
"1033",4.5,"  Ready Player One is an extremely fun and action packed movie, but doesn't stop there. This action is combined well with a massive load of pop culture references, an intriguing story, and relatable characters. The story takes place in 2045 Columbus, where the world is grim. To escape this reality, people spent great portions of their time in the OASIS, a virtual reality world. The creator, James Halliday created a hidden game in which the avatars are to find three keys and the winner of this game would be granted the control of the OASIS. One of these avatars is Parzival, whose name is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) in the real world. He is the movies main protagonist and lives in one of the slum areas of Columbus. Wade too spends time in the OASIS to avoid the often harsh realities of his home life. The story follows Wade on his quest to find these keys, and he is joined alongside Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), a girl he meets in the OASIS and slowly develops feelings for her. These two have strong chemistry and are terrific leads in this film. Wade has a best friend too called Aech who also joins him on his adventures. There are other minor characters and allies too, who have interesting moments but are not fleshed out enough. There is an organization called Innovative Online Industries (IOI), led by Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) who want the keys in order to take control on the OASIS to give them more power and wealth in the real world. This premise works well throughout the film, as the stakes are felt both in the OASIS and in the real world. The visuals in this film are absolutely breathtaking, and Spielberg and his team have produced one of the best looking films in a long time. The music is also terrific, adding to the fun of the film and is part of the pop culture nostalgia. The references are very frequent, but they do not overwhelm the film, rather they add to it. Some of the references are minor and will be easier to spot on Blu-ray when the time comes, but there are many references that are important to the story. There is one reference to a movie in particular that is very integral to finding the second key and the characters spend significant time here. This sequence works well though and highlights how impressive the effects and story are in this film. The references vary from video games to movies to music from several decades, so there will be enough for every audience member to recognize no matter what age. The pacing is fairly good considering the 140 minute run time, with action sequences in every act. These scenes are the greatest elements of the film, the most notable being the final fight in the Third Act. The only major downfall of the film is the resolution of the IOI threat in really life. After many scenes of intense action, the resolution is very anticlimactic and disappointing. This part could have been written much better. Overall, Ready Player One is one of the most entertaining and greatest films of the year so far. The pop culture references are connectable and a lot of fun to see, the characters are very relatable, the leading acting performances are terrific, the story is intriguing, and the action sequences are some of the greatest bits of cinema Spielberg had produced. Steven Spieling has produced one of his greatest movies ever and once again proves he is the master of action and adventure!","Ready Player One",1033,3.5,-1

"1035",3.5,"  Ready Player One is a fun film with tons of pop culture tidbits but only takes the characters names, the bare bones of the plot, and one location (the stacks) from the book.

"1036",1,"  The worst book to film adaptation I have ever seen. Possibly one of the worst films not even considering there was source material. Honestly, I'd rather watch Batman v Superman. The film lacked any heart or emotional investment on the part of the audience or the characters. Constantly contradicting itself it fails to establish anything that the audience might care about outside of pop culture cameos. For a movie based on a book that was basically an ode to 80s pop culture, I don't know how they could have messed this up so badly. Not to mention this had the potential to have an amazing sound track. What we got was lack luster to say the least when you could even hear it.

"1046",5,"  Please keep in mind that the key target audience of this movie is roughly for people who are born between 1970 and 1980. Unfortunately if you are younger than this, even if you get the references you likely wouldn't appreciate them as much (please keep this in mind when you read reviews from other critics online). Regardless of your age thou, this is a very entertaining and well paced video game movie. If you like video games, you'll enjoy this movie. If you happen to be of the targeted age group, you'll love this movie! Nostalgia is a core element of this movie/story and it was handled very well when it got turned into the screenplay from the original novel.

"1054",4.5,"  One of this year's most highly anticipated movies is Ready Player One, the latest from Steven Spielberg. It's the big screen adaptation of Ernest Cline's beloved novel. There's as much riding on this film due to its fan base as there is with a new Star Wars or Marvel movie. In Columbus, Ohio in 2045, reality is a real bummer. The need to escape to a different world is paramount for so many people. The OASIS is a virtual reality world that provides an escape for people to get away from their desolate home life. Their homes are tiny trailers and vans stacked on top of each other, aka ""The Stacks"". Wade Watts (Sheridan) puts on his visor to morph into his avatar Parzival to carry out the majority of his day in the OASIS. As he says, you can be anyone you want to be and do whatever you want inside the OASIS. There are people he meets inside like Art3mis (Cooke) and Aech (Waithe) who are his best friends, yet he has never met them back in the real world.The man behind the OASIS is James Halliday (Rylance) whose recent death has the world in mourning. His final proclamation to his fans is the announcement of a new game. Buried deep within the Oasis are three keys all with clues leading to the golden Easter egg. Whoever finds the egg becomes the grand prize winner and inherits his stock and fortune from the Oasis. It's no easy feat, even for those staunch Halliday and Oasis aficionados. Five years pass by and no one has found the first key. Parzival uses everything he knows about '80s pop culture and the life of James Halliday and finds that copper key. His name appears on the leader board catapulting him to celebrity status. He's not the only one desperate to get his hands on the Easter egg. Ben Mendelsohn stars as the token villain, Nolan Sorrento. He's the head of an evil corporation named IOI (Innovative Online Industries). He sets out and orders his minions i-R0k (Miller) and F'Nale (John-Kamen) to kill Parzival whether it's in OASIS or in the real world.Director Steven Spielberg has made a love letter to his fans with this film. Watching it feels like he made it for me and the legions of other movie and video game geeks out there. It's stacked to the brim with pop culture references from all things Steven Spielberg, Stephen King, Atari, and other video games and songs that made up the 1980s. Try not to tap you toe along with its dance club-filled soundtrack. Author Ernest Cline was inspired by Spielberg's work, so it feels appropriate that only he could bring the book to life. Along for the ride is Spielberg's go-to cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski. Together they get the ball rolling with the opening race sequence. It encapsulates the exciting thrill ride that is the rest of the movie. It becomes a race for the audience to spot all the references thrown out in this one scene, including: the '66 Batmobile, the Back to the Future DeLorean, and King Kong, just to name a few. More importantly, this scene also showcases the stunning technical work at hand with how it all comes together.The film mixes live action, motion capture, and other CG tricks as it goes between real life in the Stacks versus what happens in the OASIS. They shot it using 35mm film giving it that grainy VHS quality as a nod to the times. This choice provides a greater contrast to the OASIS sequences. It's a visually stunning feat with seamless transitions. This shouldn't quite come as a surprise as this is what we love about Spielberg. He knows how to make any movie artistically sharp when you think back to how he created the shark in Jaws or how he revealed the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. It would be a shame not to recognize the special effects work come award season.The look of the film is obviously complex to pull off, yet the story is quite simple and effective. Part of it is the underdog David and Goliath story with Wade/Parzival going up against Sorrento. It's all set to a very Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory model hence the use of ""Pure Imagination"" in the film's trailer. Wade/Parzival is the Charlie Bucket looking to inherit Halliday's chocolate factory, the OASIS. Spielberg reminds us that this is more than just a silly video game movie. There are shots along the way where the humans are in battle and we see them interacting by themselves with their visors and gloves on. It's that growing trend we're facing with everyone buried in their phones without having a personal interaction with the person next to them. The character of Wade/Parzival asks the viewer to find their purpose in life, like he has, so there isn't always this instant urge to run off to a different reality as found in video games, movies, or television. It's a bit ironic coming from a movie where it idolizes the 1980s pop culture scene.It may be my adoration for all things Spielberg, but I found Ready Player One extremely accessible for non-gamers out there like myself. When reading the book, it's saturated in video game language where the movie feels open to a larger audience. Staunch lovers of the book will notice substantial differences, but it's worth keeping in mind that getting the rights to showcase certain references became an issue with bringing the movie to life. Author Ernest Cline co-wrote the screenplay with Zak Penn, so I trust his stamp of approval over the film.Spielberg has created another crowning achievement that's more than a nostalgic trip for those who grew up in the 1980s watching his movies. I would hope that the younger generation dazzles in the eye-popping storytelling much like I did when I saw Spielberg's early films as a kid. On a deeper level, I hope they take note of the diversity factor at hand when Wade and his High Five gang come together for the first time as humans as opposed to avatars. They're bound by a common goal regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity. Maybe, just maybe, they'll put their phones down long enough to talk about it in actual reality instead of the virtual reality of Snap Chat-ing about it.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies?

The cast is solid enough, even if most don't resemble the book's descriptions, H is the only character that (I felt) was spot on.The ""movie game"" scenes in the book were really cool, they kind of made one in the movie, only totally different, but also cool in its own way.So again, if you're a die-hard fan of the book - you will whine and complain like some of my friends, but if you can step away from your preconceptions, you just might realize you had one helleva ride.","Ready Player One",1071,3.5,-0.5

"1075",3,"  Vomiting alert !!?? Vomiting alert!! ?? A heads up for everyone who wants to go watch the movie: DO NOT GO TO THIS RIGHT AFTER EATING A BIG MEAL ! I personally love the IMAX 3D effects! And I do understand you need certain amount of it to make viewers a bit dizzy, as a bit of show off of the technology and cinematography. Normally is only about 5 to 10 minutes. But this is movie will make you feel nauseous for OVER AN HOUR! And I am not kidding, especially after my big breakfast, when I put on that IMAX 3D glasses I almost vomited in the theater. I have to intermittently take the glasses off, and watch the movie with my naked eye in a IMAX 3D screen. Not fun !! And very difficult to enjoy the movie. Okay, back to the movie review. I do have give credit to the writing of this film. The story take place in 2045, in very near future with just a bit more technology advancement than right now. Apparently, the VR games are gonna be the future! Every thing in the game world is just as what we expected: fast, thrilling and very realistic. There are many characters and very detailed storyline, kudos for the writer to compress a lot of the content and stories in just 2 hours. The mission of writing is maybe too big of a bite to chew on it. Towards the last 1/4 of the movie, it's twist after twists, flip after flips. Every scene is either about the good guy is on top, then 3 mins later the bad guy, then the good guy in on top again, and the bad guy is over powering, then flip again, again, again, and over again..... It's a bit difficult to follow the story or be submerged in that world, because when you just realized how the storyline and trying to go into the movie, you got pushed out immediately by the next scene! Halliday's life, which is the basically the history of video games. Make me really reminiscing with all the games that I grow up with, especially the arcade game characters. Skipping school, and lying to my parents about studying in the library, just to play the arcade games or friend's new Nintendo. Not a good example for kids, but I guess we all been there. Tempo of the movie is very fast, in fact that the whole movie never slowed down. Normally fans like that, but with even faster, drowsy 3D screen, everything is too much to an extreme. And the extreme fast tempo and extreme fast graphics are making each scene seems very choppy. There is rarely one shot to from the beginning to the end. A lot of 3D graphic creations that I really would like to watch it closely, to appreciate how difficult and detailed it was made by these first class artist. Of course, everything only had about 1 second of screen time, you hardly can see anything clearly. Seems like it needs a lot of editing to slow it down for audiences to really feel the level of the awesomeness in the 3D graphic illustration and graphics. Another thing about the tempo is the speed of dialogue. Obviously Kaiden and Sho, these two characters are speaking English as 2nd language. But they seems like is exchanging conversation with people in their 20s and 30s in their first language. This is not very realistic! If you have had experience of learning and speaking other language, you would realized that you process everything much slower than the first language speakers. Because the brain needs time to process and put the words together, and sometimes they are not necessarily grammatically correct. Over I have more issues with the tempo than anything else. It started really fast, stayed really fast, and ended fast. When there is not contrast of slow and fast, it just make the whole movie seems very flat!!Special effects and sounds effects are definitely top-notch. You can see the movie makers are desperately trying to showcase all they got. And it shows! It's like spice-packed Indian food: cumin, curry, carrot, onion.... etc, everything that's good, why don't we throw it in the pot, then pressure cook it. What you get after is just a pot of delicious texture-less BLAH! In the movie you definitely all the characters from the history of video games. When I say all, I meant ALL! There are all the SNK's street fighter, ex. Chun-Li and kyo. Capcom's fighters in FULL REUNION. Hello Kitty and ALL her friends!!!! Not sure what are they doing there, why there are there. And mostly importantly, they are not related to any part of the storyline. So why they are all there? Not sure ?? In terms of acting, it's a easy job. Most the time the actors had VR goggles on. As major of the movie takes place in the VR game, very little reality was featured in the movie. However there are. Especially when it's Halliday's line of story. It's mostly real person acted out, wonder why Halliday didn't have an avatar, and really wonder why how come Halliday wasn't a character in the game. I feel like his line of story can be better developed, or maybe explain it better in the sequel ready player 2. ?? Last but not lease is the theme: ""Reality is real."" This line has repeatedly come out from the very beginning of the movie to the very end. Therefore it's very nature for me to assume that it's the theme of the movie. Every time this line appears, it did not hit me, like why it's important and how it become this important. Each time when this theme-line came out, it didn't create an ah-ha moment. I know reality is real, because when you die, you disappear in reality with your avatar in the game. Every time this line come out, the value of reality really did not elevate in my mind. Maybe because I was so nauseous by 20 minutes in the movie til the end. It really lack of a lot of development why reality is so real to us, maybe because there is only one reality? So you should make it count!","Ready Player One",1075,3.5,0.5
"1076",1.5,"  This is the same guy that made ET and Jurassic Park?!? If you liked the book at all, be warned that the only thing they have in common is the character names (and thats not even completely true). Other then that the book and movie have nothing in common. With that said the movie on its own is terrible. Let me correct that, if you absolutely love popcorn movies, have no concern for plot or a good characters then you might like this. Wade does absolutely nothing in the movie, the cast of characters around him pretty much do it all and jesus is he so blah. Parts of the book that are well explained because they are important to the story are just skipped over in a 2second voice over. There is no real explanation about what or why things are happening but hey I just say chuckie and a ninja turtle so who cares! As a product of the 80's, I felt that nostalgia as well but a Delorean and t rex only work if the movie is actually interesting. Spielberg did this movie probably because he only had to shoot a couple days of actual live acton and the rest is CGI. If you thought Jurassic World was great, go see this.","Ready Player One",1076,3.5,2
"1077",5,"  I loved this movie. The plot was interesting and the characters were funny. I loved all the pop-culture references and easter eggs. This movie showcase a lot of what I, and many others, love about video games while also acknowledging that we need to maintain our grip on reality. I know that this movie is highly unlikely to get a sequel, but I would be happy to see one made.","Ready Player One",1077,3.5,-1.5
"1078",4.5,"  While offering an amazing visual entertainment, Ready Player One has it almost all right, with a well-organized story, classic movies details and getting the audience into this hi-probably future of the world. Not a perfect score as the actors could be better. Mention good performances from Simon Pegg and Ben Mendelsohn.","Ready Player One",1078,3.5,-1
"1079",5,"  I read the book before going to see this movie, which in my opinion. I think everyone should do before they see this film. I absolutely LOVED this film!!

"1080",5,"  Really good movie ! Every gamer's dream !","Ready Player One",1080,3.5,-1.5
"1081",1,"  I am shocked Cline let them make so many changes from the book! They sliced, diced, chopped, and then added a ton of original material that it lost the total charisma of the story. Cline should of taken advise from JK Rowling on how to bring the pages to the screen. When it says ""Based on the Book"" - they aren't kidding, it is very loosely based. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend you do! Or listen to it on audio - Will Wheaton does an excellent job!","Ready Player One",1081,3.5,2.5
"1082",4,"  I thought it was a good show would watch it again","Ready Player One",1082,3.5,-0.5
"1083",2.5,"  Just okay as a movie, but I came away thinking what a waste of resources it was. Didn't read the book, but seeing the moving it was clear that a lot was left out, such big holes that were vital to the real plot. What is left is little more than a video game with a boy meets girl story. No laughs. No lines or plot worth remembering. No philosophy. The world itself makes no sense. The way people act, especially toward a man with a gun at the end as so unrealistic that it takes you out of the movie entirely. People say this is a throwback to young Spielberg, but young Spielberg was all heart and soul. Now he is all politics and political correctness. Movie has wonderfully diverse characters without any character at all. In Director's cut, gun at the end will be replaced with a walkie-talkie and it will be praised as a surrealistic masterpiece. Oh, yeas, saw in 3D XD, really crappy visuals and sound. Seen foreign movies that do 3D so much better.","Ready Player One",1083,3.5,1
"1084",5,"  Ready Player One was a fantastic thrill ride of nostalgia. The entire film was packed full of pop culture Easter eggs. While the main heroes searched for their own Easter eggs, we the audience got to search along with them for both the real world Easter eggs as well as the fictional ones. The film was different from the book but any true Ready Player One fan should see that the movie just gives us more content to enjoy. Not only in the movie, but in our real world we get all the artwork, merchandise, collectables, etc. I'm super excited for all the collectables to come from this movie. Our characters now have faces instead of what we imagined the look like. The book was amazing. The movie is also amazing. I personally will be re-watching the movie probably as many times as I read the book, which was 4 times. The only things I didn't like from the movie were that they didn't bring to life Ludus on screen for everyone to see. I really wanted the world to see what a virtual school would look like. Oh well though. If you loved the book, don't complain about the movie giving us extra content to enjoy.","Ready Player One",1084,3.5,-1.5

"1086",5,"  The film was just overwhelming and the special effects are amazing!","Ready Player One",1086,3.5,-1.5
"1087",3,"  Not faithful to the book at all, but visually appealing. Many of my favorite scenes from the book were not included. I also felt like the movie was aged down and a bit too cheesy. Pretty bummed as it is my favorite book that I've read in the past 10 years. I'll give it another try to see if I can get rid of this taste in my mouth.","Ready Player One",1087,3.5,0.5
"1088",4,"  Only four stars because overall the movie was great, but as a collective I can respect that it wasn't the best movie ever. However, the special effects, storytelling and character portrayal, and pure nostalgia BOMB made this an excellent movie.Would see again at theater prices.","Ready Player One",1088,3.5,-0.5
"1089",1.5,"  Quite unnecessary. Once again, pandering to nostalgia culture and pushing the VR tech to be normalised narrative - and that's about it.","Ready Player One",1089,3.5,2
"1090",3.5,"  I made the mistake of reading the book first.....just wasn't as good. Many of the themes are lost in this movie and makes me wonder if Spielberg or the screenplay writer actually read it....or better yet...understood it","Ready Player One",1090,3.5,0
"1091",2.5,"  [Spoilers ahead]Addressing a challenging and important idea - of humanity being ""consumed"" by social networks - Ready Player One falls short. It seems like all dialogues occur between children in the kindergarten and the main antagonist is just a bully from another neighborhood. Memories recorded by Halliday tell about childish quarrels rather than bring up philosophical message of making (inevitable) mistakes and being sorry for them a whole life. In just a matter of minutes heroes change sides, fall on love, loose family members, but it is not a problem for them to continue playing an extremely boring world of the OASIS. It is hard to grasp any idea or message of Ready Player One - except that total domination of VR social networks which leads to people loosing real money, health and their lives is actually fine. The only thing which is needed to be done by ""good"" protagonists is to establish two ""days-off"" from the game per week.One may enjoy both obvious and hidden links to other movies and games, but that's everything that Ready Player One has to offer.","Ready Player One",1091,3.5,1

I really am hoping this is not the future of the earth because it's really depressing :( Makes me miss my Sega and Nintendo DS :( But we're all confused about the end of the game where the players weren't in the game anymore,they're in some kind of room from the maker's (Halliday) childhood..? It doesn't make any sense :(","Ready Player One",1093,3.5,1
"1094",3.5,"  A strikingly visual film that needed more depth on some of its themes","Ready Player One",1094,3.5,0
"1095",4,"  What a great movie! With jaw-dropping visual effects, it explores the infinitely interesting and overwhelming possibilities of virtual reality and the future of video games, without forgetting to reflect on the eventual perils that might come with it, reminding us that, ultimately, reality is what really matters.","Ready Player One",1095,3.5,-0.5
"1096",2.5,"  Ready Player One may have impressive visuals and a nice plot, however these barely make up for the awkward and often cringeworthy character interactions. Art3mis and parzival bring an increased amount of frustration. A lack of chemistry between the actors was somewhat obvious. I loved the book, with it's endless 80's references and amazing characters, however Spielberg's rendition did not live up to the source material. Unlikely to recommend.","Ready Player One",1096,3.5,1

"1107",3.5,"  Ready Player One was funnier and more fun than it had any right to be. I'm not in love with it but I had fun.I wasn't amazed and thought it had some problems. But considering I had zero expectations I thought it was fine.There are some pacing issues with some of the action scenes going on for too long, or some of the internal logic not really making any sense. But on the other hand some of the jokes about soul less corporation monetization of everything were pretty funny. So it does kind of balance out.Don't expect something deep and you'll be pleasantly surprised where the movie takes you.Overall there are worse ways to spend near 3 hours on a movie.","Ready Player One",1107,3.5,0

"1109",2,"  Be prepared for this film to be nothing like the book. It appears Spielberg pulled what he thought would be the flashiest moments in a misguided attempt to appease fans but left out all of the character building, nuance and intelligent problem solving that made the book so engrossing. Just another film in the Michael Bay-ification of our movie culture. Where Parzival uses his mind to overcome his limited resources we get instead challenges that are the biggest mess of explosions and random cultural references I've ever seen. This is all apart from the terrible, hole filled plot that sees interesting, complex characters devolved into hollow caricatures plucked right out of a generic movie handbook. The second half of the film is arguably one of the worst messes of a movie I've seen. It almost seemed like Spielberg was trying to make a parody of what a Spielberg movie is. As a fan of the book, I was angry. As a fan of movies, I was disappointed. Second star was for the stellar cgi.","Ready Player One",1109,3.5,1.5
"1110",4.5,"  Encapsulating almost everything we know and love about the 70's to the 90's, Ready Player One brings along a whole new ""level"" of visual beauty, suitable humor, and a feast of references that once again proves Spielberg is in control of his immaculate and breath-taking creations!","Ready Player One",1110,3.5,-1
"1111",1.5,"  Compared to the book: wrong. I kept asking aloud, ""what movie is this?!"" because so much about the characters and plot were blatantly wrong. Not just little things either.. Huge plot points/characters/significant details and events from the book are either twisted or missing, with a lot of unnecessary things added. As a stand-alone movie: CGI train wreck. The ""plot"" they shuffled together is all over the place and feels rushed with gratuitous nostalgia sprinkled liberally (because that's what those stupid nerds want, amirite?). I'll probably see it one more time just to try and see it for what it is without being blinded by rage, but I'm going to use my Moviepass so I'm not actually wasting money this time (I saw it in Imax). Keep in mind I'm no critic or know a lot about movies, so all I can say is that nearly everything I loved about the book is missing from this film.","Ready Player One",1111,3.5,2
"1112",0.5,"  They destroyed the story, narrative and characters, the book was perfect, now it feels like The Scooby Gang of Token Characters VS The Dinosaur-Busyness-Man from planet Evilcorp.","Ready Player One",1112,3.5,3

I enjoyed all the nerdy old school references offered up throughout the film. I'm giving it 4.5 stars because of the predictability factor, but I didn't mind that so much. It was a good couple of hours to spend away from our reality regardless!","Ready Player One",1117,3.5,-1

"1121",2.5,"  It was an Ok . I assume a younger audience may appreciate it more than I did. Story was Ok. I did find a portion of it pretty boring but did appreciate the nostalgia mixed in. Skipped a lot of steps even for a longish movie. Almost fell into the ""video game"" movie advertisment genre that is so popular it seems. Visually pretty cool.","Ready Player One",1121,3.5,1
"1122",2.5,"  Ready Player One was a fine movie but this is the young adult version of Stephen Speilberg films. Worth a watch all the same.","Ready Player One",1122,3.5,1

"1126",4.5,"  Ready Player One was an excellent movie that was intellectually and visually pleasing. The virtual world that Spielberg and his team creates is one of the best I have seen since Avatar. The movie was entertaining right from the beginning hitting audiences with a dose of nostalgia, action, and storytelling right from the get-go. The story-telling, however much based off of the book, was engaging and draws you in from the start. It avoided the normal tropes of these type of movies and was able to surprise and challenge the viewer. This may have been because of the cleverness of the book which benefitting the movie's plot as well. Although the acting was average and there were some continuity issues with the rules of the Oasis and how players interact with it, I believe these factors can be overlooked because of how much fun the movie is overall and how smart it is in other contexts. I am not sure how closely the movie follows the book but on its own, it is a great movie.","Ready Player One",1126,3.5,-1
"1127",4,"  Fun movie made better due to nostalgia and great easter egg placements; but still missing that oomph.","Ready Player One",1127,3.5,-0.5
"1128",4,"  I'm a big fan of the book. it's a must read! book was better then the movie, but only because of movie time constraints. I really hope an expanded version of the movie is released for home entertainment. Movie characters were better then book and some of the complicated logistics in the book were streamlined to make the story flow better. Overall, great movie, and great fun!","Ready Player One",1128,3.5,-0.5
"1129",5,"  Absolutely amazing in every sense of the word.","Ready Player One",1129,3.5,-1.5
"1130",4,"  I was pretty worried about the movie adaptation. I loved the book even though it is more of a guilty pleasure than amazing writing. The movie was very good though, but no where near as many 80s references as I would have hoped.

"1150",5,"  Yes this is literally an Eaaster egg movie literally about Easter eggs chocked full of Easter eggs. It is really refreshing to bring back Spielberg's style of storytelling with today's graphics standards. Nothing is held back as far as nestalgia. The whole plot is about the life's missed opportunities of the lead programmer. Spielberg's best work since Jurassic Park.","Ready Player One",1150,3.5,-1.5
"1151",3.5,"  Ready Player One is freakin' awesome, but it's far from perfect. I recommend this movie to fans of any and all 80s movies, TV, or other pop culture, but there's definitely stuff in there that's gonna bug film fans like me.Obviously, as I mentioned, this film is awesome. The action scenes are exhilarating and fun, and they aren't even real, they're CG animated! Of course, this is a result of the talent of Steven Spielberg behind the... camera? Either way, Spielberg shows once again that he knows how to choreograph a stellar action scene, even without the use of music. While Alan Silvestri's score for this movie is phenomenal, the action scenes that use no music really impress. This movie keeps the energy and pace up, until the 3rd act that is. By then this movie gets a little sluggish and dull, and it's disappointing considering all the great scenes that come before. This movie nearly beats Wonder Woman for worst 3rd act of a great action movie ever. The first 10 or so minutes of this movie also rely on narration to explain what's going on, which is very lazy. Most people know the shtick before going in to this movie, and if not it's pretty easy to pick up, so it's annoying and lazy that the screenwriters chose to throw in a narration.Overall, though, Ready Player One is a lot of fun. Spielberg puts together an entertaining movie with fantastic action scenes. While the 3rd act is sluggish and the narration at the beginning is annoying, I was still (mostly) enjoying myself the entire time. If you love 80s movies, I can't recommend Ready Player One enough. While it's not without its' flaws, ready Player One is good, Spielbergian fun.","Ready Player One",1151,3.5,0

"1162",2,"  This movie is only slightly related to the book - same character names and a mutilation of the basic story outline. The book wasn't perfect and was tedious in its obsessive documentation of 1980s pop culture. However, it had story and plot elements that made up for that. Everything that was thoughtful and good about the story and the plot was removed or altered dramatically, and none of those changes were for the better. The movie version didn't even attempt to be logical or follow a coherant narrative path. The acting was painful to watch and seemed like it was geared towards 5 year olds and yet pointless extra sexuality was added to the story. This is a movie that caters to the lowest common denominator. Yes it has great special effects. It's a roller coast movie. If all you want is mindless visual effects, if you enjoy watching other people play video games, then this is a movie you might appreciate. If you expect film to be an experience for both the eyes AND the mind, you will be disappointed. If you liked the book, you will hate the movie.","Ready Player One",1162,3.5,1.5
"1163",5,"  Awesome entertainment start to finish, visually aurally, great work Stephen,","Ready Player One",1163,3.5,-1.5
"1164",3,"  For context, I am a major fan of the book, and was thoroughly excited to see this film. Based on the numerous trailers for this movie, I fully expected the story to be changed, but to enjoy a thrilling ride as Spielberg so often delivers. While I enjoyed watching the film, I was constantly met with frustration in the cinematography, and in just HOW MUCH the story was changed.I think if you go into this movie having not read the book, or with a full understanding that there is little to no similarity to the book's story, it will be far more enjoyable. This film is not bad by any means, but movie-to-book relationship aside, there were some major letdowns for me.The trailer seemed to promise some strong action scenes with a killer soundtrack to boot. However, this subject was honestly one major disappointment of the film for me. There was only one scene scored by an 80's hit. The song selection was spectacular - ""We're not gonna take it"" by Twisted Sister, but we got only about 5 words into the song when the foley completely drowned out the music. I'm not saying that things should be mute during a song such as this, but the audience literally could not hear the music at all over character dialogue and the surrounding scene's guns, explosions, etc. I do hope that others got a better experience during this particular scene, and that perhaps this was the fault of the theater's audio system, but the trailers we were given gave me the distinct impression of a very different tone to this movie.There were many other cinematic issues and plot holes that I was disappointed in, especially for a Spielberg film, but delving into those would be spoiler ridden. Baseline: Go see this movie, it is worth the watch, but try and put the book and the trailers for the film out of your mind. I would be willing to bet that this experience would be far better with such a frame of mind.","Ready Player One",1164,3.5,0.5

"1166",4.5,"  Smiled ear to ear through the whole movie with several laughing out loud in the theater moments. A fun thrill ride mixed with so much nostalgia. I had to see it twice just to see what I missed the first time. Don't think it is your cup of tea? A friend went to see it on a date but had no interested in it at all. She has now seen it twice and wants to see it again. You won't regret playing this game.","Ready Player One",1166,3.5,-1

"1168",4,"  Rather than being a one-trick movie, READY PLAYER ONE utilises it's dazzling visuals to tell an entertaining, engrossing and, eventually, even touching story. Spielberg masterfully manages pop culture references, cheesiness, retro music, a decent main cast, perfectly casted secondary characters (namely Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg), mind-blowing action and an all around epic story without ever overindulging in any one ingredient.This might not be Spielberg's best work, but it's a wonderful showcase of great movie making.I saw this in IMAX 3D and would recommend the experience to fully enjoy the ride.","Ready Player One",1168,3.5,-0.5

"1172",5,"  The best movie for every gamer to watch.","Ready Player One",1172,3.5,-1.5
"1173",3.5,"  This is a moderately fun adventure movie... just don't expect anything more than surface-level entertainment. The film tells two concurrent stories - one in the fantasy world and one in the real world - and unfortunately, only one of those stories is interesting. After some lengthy (and somewhat clunky) voiceover narration establishes the setting (a future world where all of society is dominated by a virtual reality game called ""The Oasis""), the movie dives right in to the story that takes place within the game. This is where the movie really shines. It's wildly creative and the ""quest""-type storyline really appealed to the gamer in me. The first hour is almost entirely GCI, but it doesn't matter because the CGI is amazing and the virtual world is so detailed and immersive, it really feels like the best video game you ever played. I was all in. But the fun tapers off when the story moves into the real world and starts to draaaaaag. For a story about the dangers of becoming too disconnected from reality, it's so much more interesting when it's all about the fantasy world! I had become really invested in the characters' in-game avatars, but the characters IRL (that's ""in real life"" for you noobs) were totally flat and bored me to tears. The ""real world"" story is disappointingly trite - the typical ""good vs evil"" constructs on which the story is built are predictable and dull. All the heroes are poor little guys, and the villain is the embodiment of corporate greed (even the skilled Ben Mendelsohn as the Big Bad couldn't give that character any depth). I was praying for the film to find an excuse to go back into the virtual world - and it did eventually oblige me, but even then, it never recaptures the magic that made the first hour so cool. The overall story has a juvenile feel to it that targets kids, which is a bit of a paradox as a huge part of what makes this movie fun is the constant stream of 80's pop culture references. I fear that much of it will be lost on younger viewers who may not have seen those movies/shows... woe to the viewer who was born after 1990! But for Gen-Xers, it's a delight to identify the cornucopia of ""easter eggs"" (which are a major plot point of the story) planted all around this film... it would require many viewings to catch them all. Despite that, the movie is too long and the story was not consistently engaging enough to sustain my interest. By the end of the third act, nearly everything that had me invested in the story had slowly crumbled away, culminating in one of the lamest endings of all time. The movie is fancy and looks great, but it has no heart... and without that, it's just a fairly run-of-the-mill popcorn flick.","Ready Player One",1173,3.5,0
"1174",3,"  On it's own - this movie is entertaining - compared to the book - it's poorly done. I went with the entertainment factor and treated it separately from the book.","Ready Player One",1174,3.5,0.5

"1176",5,"  A fantastic world of it's own, Ready Player One takes us on a magical adventure through digital and analogue realities, and emphasising the importance to maintain the balance between the two in the real world.

"1178",4,"  Very fun movie and it looked amazing in IMAX 3D and the opening race and final scene really need to be seen on the big screen. For a 2 1/2 hour movie, it went by very fast and was a lot of fun. I had read the book but was expecting some pretty significant changes, most of which I was cool with.

"1182",5,"  I go to be entertained, and this did with a bang. Adding to the fun was identifying the 80's event to the movie event... loved the Terminator reference.","Ready Player One",1182,3.5,-1.5
"1183",1,"  For any fan of the book, a work deeply loved because of its specific cultural references and the characters interaction with them, this film will be a deep disappointment. It delivers on nearly none of the pay offs that occurred in the writing. The completely unnecessary added characters and entirely different challenges faced do not provide much enjoyment. Admittedly, a very difficult movie to make based on the immense amount of cultural references, but it would have been better if they gave up on this project in the planning stages. Very bad experience.","Ready Player One",1183,3.5,2.5
"1184",1,"  Did Spielberg read the book at all? What about the stupid scene about racing? The one who plays video games always tries to go backward and see what will happen. So after the 5 years would probably someone already figure it out in the movie. Nothing like the book. The first gate should be in the dungeon that would be great to picture it. Also missing more of the 80's reference in the movie. Yeah, some parts were funny but I did not like it. If you did not read the book, you should definitely read it because it is pretty amazing, geeky book.","Ready Player One",1184,3.5,2.5

"1188",4,"  A fast-paced action, adventure, sci-fi from Steven Spielberg. The action is stunning and the story has some interesting things to say about our modern obsession with online living as compensation for the reality of life which is not always pleasant. The self-conscious references to 80's pop culture is a bit annoying at times and some of the dialogue gets pretty cheesy. But, overall, an captivating movie that is full of energy, although it could have been a bit shorter. Possibly the best Spielberg entertainment we've seen for a while. Worth seeing in 3D if you have the opportunity.","Ready Player One",1188,3.5,-0.5
"1189",3,"  A truly movie tribute to the 80's culture with Back to the Future background. However, despite surfing in the wave of pop, the pace is at times too slow, straight line story and interaction between the casts is just too plain.","Ready Player One",1189,3.5,0.5
"1190",4,"  A welcomed return for 'Popcorn' Spielberg, this adaptation of Ernest Cline's novel seems perfect for his sentiments, if not tailor-made to someone whose filmography defines the era in which this story pays loving homage to. Set in 2045, our hero, played by a likeable Tye Sheridan (and his conveniently located team of gamers which allows them to come together in a final showdown in the real world) has to hunt for 3 keys left in a Virtual Reality world called the OASIS on its creator's death in order to win the ultimate prize of a vast fortune and ownership of the OASIS itself. So far so Willy Wonka. Taking place in both a deliberately monochrome styled reality and a more vibrant and colourful virtual world overflowing with gaming, cinematic and other culturally iconic references, the film dexterously flips back and forth under Spielberg's masterly control. Films set in virtual reality have often looked awkward and unreal and since nobody enjoys watching someone else plays a videogame for 2 1/2 hours, this can be a very disengaging experience. Spielberg has no problem however making it convincing and exciting to watch right from the first VR race challenge to a surprising homage to a classic 80s film (which is different from the source material and not as on topic, but it is so much fun to watch, it'll be churlish to complain about the change) as he shows off a playfulness we have not seen for a while in his work. Despite a broad and none too menacing baddie played by Ben Mendelsohn, who feels regurgitated from his previous roles, this is a visually dazzling and very geeky rollercoaster ride of a film, that shows that the Spielberg who gave us Raiders, Goonies and E.T. should come out to play more often.","Ready Player One",1190,3.5,-0.5

"1194",2.5,"  The first half of the movie is non-stop action and fun, although a bit dizzying with 90% of it being CGI with the audience inside the virtual world of the Oasis. I never felt any connection to the protagonist nor was there any real suspense. I hated the fact that the movie glorifies virtual reality, so much so, that that is ALL the citizens of 2045 do - they live in the Oasis and other than a small throwaway line at the end - this isn't going to change regardless of our ""hero's"" triumph. Not a spoiler since it's clear from the beginning he will overcome the odds. Very disappointing and disturbing. I'd almost prefer armageddon to Spielburg's future in this movie.","Ready Player One",1194,3.5,1

"1200",5,"  Spielberg's Ready Player one is a delight to watch. A great adventure movie that is not ashamed to just be fun and also teach us a thing or two. I loved it.

"1201",5,"  So much Nostalgia feels during this feature. Too many Easter Eggs to mention and i'm sure I missed many more. They come in quotes, music and looking out for them. Great cast and story. Looking forward to reading the book version of this already. Loved the Shining reference and the CGI was fantastic. Highly recommended for a true Escape movie from everyday life. Added bonus is the main characters second name...Best Second name ever ;).","Ready Player One",1201,3.5,-1.5

"1203",5,"  This is one film I would happily put in my video library, not just digitally but my physical library which only hold the best for me. This movie shows that even older generation members such as Speilberg can reach out and connect with the modern generation. He does so brilliantly with a movie about escapism, wanting to leave behind the troubles of the world for something better. But while this is prominent, it isn't what causes the issues, it's the tool used to save the world we live in. Just as Back to the Future has the deloreon, or the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz, they are but the tools which drives the plot forward. This movie uses something so abstract as escapism as such a tool, and it does it brilliantly. I personally would enjoy a place like the one shown in film, to participate and have fun within. It does it in a way which other escapism movies dont, and I love it. Also, the references to other media doesn't hinder the movie in the least, it's a love note to each and it leaves it at that. The characters are well done and acted as well, each one relatable and believable. Heck, I know people who match some of the characters in what they do and how they act. I cannot recommend any movie more than Ready Player One.","Ready Player One",1203,3.5,-1.5

"1208",5,"  A truly classic Spielberg movie. It combines a passion for popular culture, with the drama and creativeness of an original storyline. With references to popular movies of times gone by, it makes watching the film even more fun. A lot happens, but things move quickly, allowing the story to flow with ease while keeping you guessing. A mixture of laughs, some sadness, empathy and excitement carry through the film, helping the story connect with the audience, and for us to get behind the main protagonist. It's a must watch, but make sure to watch every movie ever beforehand to get the real effect!","Ready Player One",1208,3.5,-1.5

"1214",3,"  ""I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread."" Those words come courtesy of Bilbo (Ian Holm) in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. But they also illustrate perfectly why Ready Player One, while fun in parts and an overall success, doesn't quite capture the magic of its director's past blockbusters.That director is Stephen Spielberg, an ideal choice to spearhead a film celebrating every dimension and detail of late-twentieth-century pop culture. Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Back to the Future, Jurassic Park-these are just a few of the properties he has brought to the big screen. If each of them could look in from the past to see this newest creation, what would they say? One thing is undeniable: Ready Player One, whether the movie or Ernest Cline's bestselling novel on which it is based, stands as one of the most original entertainment entities of the new millennium. Its story occurs in the year 2045, with society having taken a less-than-utopian turn. Consequently, nearly everyone spends their time plugged into a virtual world known as the OASIS. Money, friends, fame, love-anything worth experiencing happens in there. Reality is for losers.Especially considering that the game's original designer, James Halliday (a brilliant Mark Rylance), planted a special egg deep within its digital walls. The first 'player' to find the egg gets half a trillion dollars and total control of the OASIS (which, essentially, amounts to world domination). The catch? The path to the egg consists exclusively of contests, quizzes and other tricky breadcrumbs based on Halliday's love for 80's movies, music and video games. Know the founder and you'll find the finish line.This is exactly what teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) intends to do. Thanks to his obsessive knowledge of Halliday, he (and thus, his OASIS avatar Parzival) have a great chance to succeed. He's also got a best friend (Aech), a new girl (Art3mis) and an arch nemesis (Nolan Sorrento, head of IOI, the sinister real-world corporation that also wants control of the OASIS).This is the short version, and still a lot to unpack. I don't want to be 'that guy,' but I did read the book before I saw the movie. For anyone else in the same boat, it should be noted that the movie departs from its source material on several fronts.Many adjustments are necessary and simply based on the medium. An early scene from the book involving a video game competition becomes a massive, exhilarating car race in the movie. The latter, of course, is much more suited to a visual experience, and the production's willingness to adapt should be applauded. Nor are the changes pure sacrilege, as Cline co-wrote the script. Each alteration echoes the author.But it also takes us back to Bilbo. For it's not just that a novel contains so much more information than a movie; it's that this particular novel is all about the information, the details. Ready Player One has characters, and a story, but cares more than anything about minutiae-the tidbits of cultural knowledge that only geeks and fanboys would know.The movie's intentions to highlight this are valiant, but misguided. Yes, we see the Iron Giant battle Mechagodzilla; we feel the eeriness of the Overlook Hotel; we hear the retro beats of Jump and We're Not Gonna Take It. But we don't fully experience any of them. There are just too many. The movie spends all its time simply reaching these coveted niches, there's none left to actually enjoy the visit.That doesn't mean, of course, that the journey can't be fun. For starters, Ready Player One might feature the most impressive use of CGI since Avatar. This is a movie that literally could not have been made twenty years ago. The story itself is well-paced, with likeable characters speeding through a fresh world of surprise and discovery.If you view the film as a series of nostalgic moments-Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Atari, The Millennium Falcon-it's hard to be disappointed. But if you're looking for those moments to add up to something-to become more than the sum of vintage parts-then you may have to resort to reading.There's a scene near the end of the film between two characters in a bedroom. It's simple, quiet; it breathes, it takes its time. Through the silence, and a touch of wonder, it leads us to emotion. Almost without knowing it, we feel like a kid again.I think this is the movie Spielberg really wanted to make. Sometimes the flash and bang and noise detract from the real entertainment. Here, it's the wonder of new worlds, and new friends. More than anything, that is the soul of Ready Player One.","Ready Player One",1214,3.5,0.5

So the characters, the story and the overall concept have been morphed, twisted and mutated from the original story. The story timeline butchered 3 mins into the movie.

"1221",4,"  A little jumbled and predictable at times. And it's definitely not book acurate (although most book adaptions aren't). The action is a little much too. Although it has its flaws, Ready Player One is endearing at its heart and definitely fun to watch.","Ready Player One",1221,3.5,-0.5

"1224",0.5,"  Ready Player One force feeds you a meat loaf hodge podge of pop culture from the 1980s onward. Although the plot caught the gist of the book (collect three keys) the challenges that were chosen for the movie were underwhelming compared to those in the book. Character development is on a level with Sword Art Online i.e. There's more character development in bowl of pancake batter. Once again Hollywood fails to capture the essence of the book. Also: howmuch did Blizzard pay to have an Overwatch character in almost EVERY SCENE?","Ready Player One",1224,3.5,3

"1226",1.5,"  Shallow movie with a shallow plot and shallow use of IP's.The actors don't know how to deliver their lines without it sounding like exposition. The CG is creepy. The use of IP's leave a lot to be desired. And most of all is that movie just wants to shove that the author is a fan of the 80's down your throat.It's a waste of potential.","Ready Player One",1226,3.5,2
"1227",2.5,"  Thoughts on Ready Player one. If you want to enjoy this movie then don't read the book. SPOILER ALERT. In the sense I spoil how closely they follow the novel.The novel was a love letter to 70s and 80s and 90s pop culture. The film was not.I was curious how many of the references and related challenges could be used due to possible copyright laws. I'm guessing none of them because almost none of the original references were used which means none of the original puzzles made it to the screen.I can understand that some things have to be cut to be crammed into a 2.5 hour flick but this was more like a complete rewrite. And the rewrites in my opinion were dumbed down echoes of the charming cleverness of the original. On a good note the graphics were great, some of the added bits were funny. Overall it felt like a gentle nod to the novel.","Ready Player One",1227,3.5,1
"1228",4.5,"  This is a really good movie and worth watching. The alternative world was well portrayed and one of the best represented fictional movies I've seen in a long time.","Ready Player One",1228,3.5,-1
"1229",5,"  Unfortunately in India the movie has released in few circles. However it's a masterpiece from the great director. Visual magic. But I would request WB to increase the theatre release in India.","Ready Player One",1229,3.5,-1.5
"1230",4.5,"  It was a very good movie didnt see that coming. I will say this will be said to be some steaven spilburgs best work","Ready Player One",1230,3.5,-1
"1231",5,"  Excellent movie very fun especially in 3D","Ready Player One",1231,3.5,-1.5
"1232",4.5,"  Before I say anything, I would just like to say that I have not read the book, though I definitely plan to sit down with it sometime soon. Perhaps my knowledge of the book, or rather lack thereof, will allow my review of the film to be unbiased based on book/movie plotlines. I greatly enjoyed this movie; it reminded me of an 80's/modern day matrix. It appealed to those of us that grew up with 80's entertainment, along with current generations who rely on games like Overwatch and Halo for their connection. The movie had a good mixing of romance, comedy, thrill, and action that was a very nice escape from cheap movies being pumped out of Hollywood thus far.One thing I felt the movie lacked was a development of certain characters/sub plots. For example, I felt like 20 more minutes of bonding between characters in the real world, contemplating the chaotic society or developing the romantic subplot of our main protagonists could have made the audience feel more connected with the heros on the big screen.All in all, I really loved the movie. I felt like it got a lot of negative backlash coming out of the door, though satisfied that the profits amassed so far speak for itself. If you haven't seen this film I would highly recommend visiting the nearest theatre and treating your yourself to a visual and emotional treat!","Ready Player One",1232,3.5,-1
"1233",4,"  I read the book first & loved it. While some of the plot & challenges are different from the book, it was well done, kept the spirit of the book, & the characters were properly done.","Ready Player One",1233,3.5,-0.5
"1234",3.5,"  Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" is a feast for the eyes and overwhelms the senses. That ends up being too much of a good thing since the film is too long and sometimes feels like just CGI crashing into your brain. Most of the film works well, though. The highlight is an extended trip through Stephen King's ""The Shining.""","Ready Player One",1234,3.5,0
"1235",5,"  It was absolutely visually amazing. Lots of 80's nostalgia, which I am a fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was, it actually made you feel like you were in an actual Virtual Reality game.","Ready Player One",1235,3.5,-1.5
"1236",4,"  A fun ride loaded with recognizable references!","Ready Player One",1236,3.5,-0.5
"1237",5,"  I absolutely loved this, packed as it is with dozens and dozens of off-handed references to pop culture trivia. It is pretty true to the book, though I did not get the same warm fuzzy feelings from the book. Would highly recommend the read, and the watch!","Ready Player One",1237,3.5,-1.5
"1238",4.5,"  One of his most fun in years!","Ready Player One",1238,3.5,-1
"1239",5,"  When was the last time you saw a movie that gave you an ear to ear smile for 2 hours and 20 minutes?Ready Player One is fun, heartfelt and provides a great journey for the viewer. The many references aren't too in your face and leave the viewer excited to spot them for themselves.A great movie for fans of pop culture and all things nerdy.","Ready Player One",1239,3.5,-1.5
"1240",5,"  One of the best syfy/virtual reality movie with the use of amazing cgi effects I have ever seen. So many references that you could probably go frame by frame and see hundreds of different video games and movies references it's outstanding. The story line and plot are well fitted for the time line it's placed. Somehow managed to fit in character development in such short time. I'm looking foward to another movie and to the year 2045","Ready Player One",1240,3.5,-1.5
"1241",5,"  Sooooooooooo good!!!!! Filled with action and 80s references, and even though it doesn't follow the book super well I still love it!!","Ready Player One",1241,3.5,-1.5
"1242",4,"  went to see it earlier today ahh gotta love it was bargain day at my theater. i really enjoyed this a lot of fun. loved easter eggs from pop culture. this made me feel like i was immersed in the virtual reality game, some parts made me chuckle. music was superb and oh the feel of a Spielberg movie the feels i tell you. i love the fact i was born in the 80's so i was an 80's and 90's kid i enjoyed using atari and super nintendo even sega. with my younger sister. of course movie references. i have never done virtual reality but i would love to try it. even the trailer music for this was awesome one of the best i have heard in years from other movies just so fit the movie. it is bit long but not that it bothered me. i am not done reading book but movie does deviate a bit so far i could see which it was supposed to and is a good thing keeping story but adding some originality. i went to see it by myself there were a few other people so like 7 in total but was weekday of course and 1st showtime of day. fun fact, though i wasn't gonna go miss half movie to go get 2 people in trouble but these two people together were vaping. like seriously i have seen people vape in wal mart first time seeing it in movie theater.i am glad to see most people have found the movie to be enjoyable. and got certified fresh that very good news.","Ready Player One",1242,3.5,-0.5
"1243",3,"  A satisfying gaming experience that brings the back to the future, and the future to the gamers.","Ready Player One",1243,3.5,0.5
"1244",1,"  I was super excited to see this movie especially because rp1 is one of my favorite books. Steven Spielberg took something great and ruined it. That hack needs to retire","Ready Player One",1244,3.5,2.5
"1245",5,"  This movie was absolutely fantastic. Somehow this movie succeeded at being the best video game movie ever made, with out really being based on any video game. This is the movie gamers and nerds have been waiting for since Super Mario Bros. from the early 90's came out. It gets nerd culture and was made with the fans in mind. While people like my parents might not necessarily ""get it"" there are enough references to non game related pop culture and a story that follows a traditional narrative story that older viewers wont be left shaking their heads with nothing to enjoy. The shear amount of easter eggs, a concept previously foriegn to most non nerd non gamers is explained beautifully in this film. As for the easter eggs themselves, i found myself jumping for joy every 10 seconds with the characters and references I kept seeing and spotting. The relatively unknown cast does a great job, and I hope this film is the one that jump starts them to super stardom. This film is also a great introduction to the genre that is cyberspace with elements such as evil megacorperations that can commit any kind of unethical crime without consequence, cyberspace, and a team of heroes that ""stick it to the man"" and fight the evil corperations. While this movie is somewhat atypical to cyberpunk as it is a more idealistic cyberpunk story (with movies such as robocop or lawnmower man being more traditional pessimistic cyberpunk stories) this is in my opinion the best ""jumping on point"" intro to cyberpunk type movie. If you like comics, video games, the 1980's, this is the movie for you. this movie is both optimistic and an overall great feel good hollywood movie. I can't recommend this movie enough go see it. and i wont even try to list all of the cameos and easter eggs in this film. not because of how many there are (although they are in the triple digits) but because that would spoil how fun they are when they appear.","Ready Player One",1245,3.5,-1.5
"1246",4.5,"  Visually stunning, very well written and with such an immersive vision, Ready Player One is one of the best cinematic experiences ever created.","Ready Player One",1246,3.5,-1
"1247",4.5,"  Steve Spielberg proves he still has the touch with this film. While Star Wars The Last Jedi was one of the worst movies of the last few years, Ready Player One ranks as one of the best. Great story with great story telling and throw backs to beloved pop culture of the 80's and early 90's makes this one a real treasure.","Ready Player One",1247,3.5,-1
"1248",4.5,"  Wonderful movie expecially to gamers.","Ready Player One",1248,3.5,-1
"1249",5,"  Simplemente GENIAL!!!","Ready Player One",1249,3.5,-1.5
"1250",4,"  A fun filled pop culture adventure.","Ready Player One",1250,3.5,-0.5
"1251",5,"  This movie is one super pop culture nerd orgasm.","Ready Player One",1251,3.5,-1.5
"1252",5,"  This movie is EPIC. It is a great movie that any age can see. I felt as if I was in a whole new world with this movie. There are very few times that I can feel myself in a movie, but with this one, I can. So many unexpected twists and turns. Love all of the imagination it has to offer!","Ready Player One",1252,3.5,-1.5
"1253",2.5,"  I was NOT ready for Player One as depicted by Spielberg. I remember putting the book down with my heart still pumping and thinking to myself ""holy sh*t, that would be an EPIC movie"". Then the movie came out and I was quickly reminded that this is Hollywood and it wouldn't be an adaptation if somebody wouldn't F*** it up royally. There's only one explanation: someone just finished reading the book and summarized it to Spielberg while they were both drunk, then while still hung-over Spielberg made a movie out of it. Forgot the order of things, mistaken one character for another and forgot half the things that made the book great, so he made something up as he went to fill the gaps. That's the best description of this movie that anyone will give you. Because of all this it was pretty, but also pretty nonsensical and lost all the drama, tension, build-ups and pay-offs. Go home Spielberg, you're drunk.","Ready Player One",1253,3.5,1
"1254",4,"  I liked the book better but I'm glad that it changed things up a bit. Biggest surprise for me was that Simon Pegg didn't have a greater role.","Ready Player One",1254,3.5,-0.5
"1255",2,"  Fun Spielberg - as opposed to serious Spielberg - features some combination of 1) excruciating tension 2) awesome set-piece scenes 3) great (character) actor bits 4) heart-tugging sentimentality. This one - though well-crafted state of the art, of course - has none of these. And on top of that, it supplies absolutely no evidence to support its ""real life is better"" bogus message. Gee, it's rough to have peaked before 30.","Ready Player One",1255,3.5,1.5
"1256",5,"  The entire family enjoyed this movie. Is it the book, no, but I never try to compare the movie to the book, you only set yourself up for disappointment. This is the first film that kept the attention of my 4 children throughout the entire movie. Will see it again.","Ready Player One",1256,3.5,-1.5
"1257",5,"  Ready player one was fucking amazing. Anyone that's well versed in video games and pop culture will nut during this movie. I almost cried several times just because of how overwhelmingly awesome it is","Ready Player One",1257,3.5,-1.5
"1258",5,"  Spielberg KILLED IT WITH THIS MOVIE. so much nostalgia and easter eggs. if you are in to movies,video games and VR then you will have a great time with this.","Ready Player One",1258,3.5,-1.5
"1259",0.5,"  Basic pure hearted teen male hero fighting the evil capitalism, falls in love with a ""cool"" girl, refuses to get corrupted by money, defends the American classic freedom value, saves the world. All that happening in a futuristic VR game.","Ready Player One",1259,3.5,3
"1260",5,"  best movie I've seen in years, gotta see it in 3D now on a return visit","Ready Player One",1260,3.5,-1.5
"1261",3.5,NA,"Ready Player One",1261,3.5,0
"1262",5,"  Loved it! Wish I could live in the Oasis! C'mon technology! Get us here!!!","Ready Player One",1262,3.5,-1.5
"1263",2.5,"  Read the book 3 times, and this movie is so boring in comparison. Everything is fast, including the plot. Movie lacks character devolpment and doesn't explain over half of itself (at one point they mention ludus, the world of schools in the book, but never showed nor mentioned it at all before then on the movie). I takes out interesting referances (supiadaman, ultraman [though ownership confusion was the meaning for that], many, many obscure arcade games, the interesting ending to the hunt [replaced with just playing atari]) for boring, common ones (the shining, overwatch, akira, iron giant). The ending felt uneventful and rushed, and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I will say the visuals (though sometimes in the uncanny valley) were interesting and fun. The out-of-bounds part of the race was fun, and the war at the end was fun to watch. TL;DR: Go read the book.","Ready Player One",1263,3.5,1
"1264",4.5,"  In anyone else's hands, this would have been a disaster. Thank Master Windu that Ernest Cline handed over the directing duties to the rightful Steven Spielberg and took it upon himself to improve his own story. Not only does the result show us the right amount of nerdy, it also wows us with the wonderful way all these references are being implemented. Without them, the story still stands on its own and reminds us to have fun when playing. It's there for entertainment, as is this movie. Our main characters know that, and they truly embody that spirit of entertainment. More generations will be inspired to do more than just love what they're watching or playing, they might find new ways to enjoy it without having to be the very best. Log in and see for yourself.","Ready Player One",1264,3.5,-1
"1265",5,"  had so much fun watching it","Ready Player One",1265,3.5,-1.5
"1266",5,"  Wow! #ReadyPlayerOne was like watching every one of my favorite movies growing up in one sitting.","Ready Player One",1266,3.5,-1.5
"1267",5,"  Best movie in 2018 so far. I would recommend it to anyone","Ready Player One",1267,3.5,-1.5
"1268",5,"  Very exciting, amazing story with a good theme and very enjoyable to watch. A fresh new idea that will make you excited to watch it. I left the theatre feeling very satisfied and feeling like I had just walked into the theatre.","Ready Player One",1268,3.5,-1.5
"1269",0.5,"  Started out as a great nostalgia book targeting 35-45 year old North American men. Went through a book-to-movie re-write where they only changed the target audience, all the characters, the entire plot, and the moral of the story .... but hid this fact in the trailers and kept the title the same so that people who liked the book would still go see the movie. If you read and liked the book stay away from this film, it will only cause you pain.","Ready Player One",1269,3.5,3
"1270",3.5,"  An enjoyable, glitzy homage to retrogaming. I was pleasantly surprised by a section of one of my favorite horror films in the middle of this which is worth the admission price alone. 3D was unnoticeable except for one scene,","Ready Player One",1270,3.5,0
"1271",5,"  I'm not into video games but I had a great time and flash backs to great games of the past.","Ready Player One",1271,3.5,-1.5
"1272",1.5,"  Honestly, it wasn't even visually appealing. It was just TOO MUCH for way too long (~2.5 hours). I feel like Spielberg was trying to make his Avatar here and fell totally flat in comparison. It's crazy to think that almost 10 years later, Avatar is still the most advanced and realistic film of this type (almost entirely animated). No one has come close to knocking Cameron off the throne.. Side note: I was appalled by the horribly campy and poorly executed Shining references. Making a mockery of one of the most terrifying and well-crafted films of all time is just embarrassing.","Ready Player One",1272,3.5,2
"1273",4,"  A thrilling visual ride. Your typical ragtag team of teens somehow managing to do what no person in history has ever done before and battling angry corporate giants along the way, jam-packed with references to popular nerd culture. My friend and I were really tickled to spot Tracer from Overwatch not once but twice in the crowds. Some references went over even our heads, and the romance had us feeling we were watching a Twilight rerun, but overall it was a fun movie. Would watch again.","Ready Player One",1273,3.5,-0.5
"1274",5,"  Took the kids to see and we all loved it and my son wants a second part to the movie now","Ready Player One",1274,3.5,-1.5
"1275",3,"  Removed al the nail biting suspense from the book and replaced it with more action sequences. Because that's want the modern movie-goer wants.","Ready Player One",1275,3.5,0.5
"1276",5,"  Brilliant, Loved it in 3D","Ready Player One",1276,3.5,-1.5
"1277",5,"  When i saw it with my friends, it was literaly one of the best movies we seen in a while, we kept having alot of laughing and easter eggs moments none stop while watching this movie. It was awesome, I cant wait for Ready Player Two, also be picking this up when it comes out on Bluray Day One.","Ready Player One",1277,3.5,-1.5
"1278",4,"  The film was good even though the book is better (well duh ??) they do improve some of the story in some parts, my only problems is it's too quick at some scenes and I can't believe I saying this I wish it was in two or three parts I hate they do that in films on one book but I feel it would have benefited the movie more and the real world back story is there but it's rushed but it's still a very good film and people should check it out","Ready Player One",1278,3.5,-0.5
"1279",5,"  This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years. It has just enough pith to keep it from being complete fluff but that's not the point. Just the shared experience and delight of the audience that watches it with you as you recognize one throwback culture reference after another would be worth 4 stars.","Ready Player One",1279,3.5,-1.5
"1280",5,"  Just the kind of oldschool adventure movie you would expect from spielberg. a must watch for every geek.","Ready Player One",1280,3.5,-1.5
"1281",4,"  Fun movie, great for kids. Excalibur!!!","Ready Player One",1281,3.5,-0.5
"1282",4,"  Very good but felt rushed. I'd have preferred them cover it in three movies.","Ready Player One",1282,3.5,-0.5
"1283",5,"  Loved the movie, I don't know why the critics are not liking it more. I'm definitely going to buy this one!","Ready Player One",1283,3.5,-1.5
"1284",5,"  I read the book, and saw the movie with someone who hasn't and decided to compare notes on what we thought about it. Whole there were things that upset me that were changed, and stuff that felt left out to her (like it's not explained why Morrow and Halliday split in the movie, at all) we both came away really enjoying the movie and looking forward to seeing it again.","Ready Player One",1284,3.5,-1.5
"1285",4,"  I have read the book 2 times now, and i rather liked the movie. The plot is quite different and refreshing from the one in the book, but they still suffer from a poor love story. The cgi was great, and the shining part was easily my favorite part in the movie.","Ready Player One",1285,3.5,-0.5
"1286",5,"  the movie was great for me it had so many movie tv song and video game references and the characters were well developed and being 14 it was great nostalgia","Ready Player One",1286,3.5,-1.5
"1287",5,"  This is a great movie, I like how the actors has to be part of the game. really enjoy the music in the movie as well. Can't wait for it to come out on blu-way","Ready Player One",1287,3.5,-1.5
"1288",4,"  Loved it. Loved everything about it. Adventure? Excitement? An audience craves these things.And they get it in this movie! Unlike a certain recent cinematic travesty.","Ready Player One",1288,3.5,-0.5
"1289",2,"  The book is excellent, I've read it a few times. The film is terrible. Nothing like the book. I feel sorry for Ernest Cline having his mane attached to this.","Ready Player One",1289,3.5,1.5
"1290",0.5,"  Poorly written. It seems like a bad joke. It also shits in the movie.","Ready Player One",1290,3.5,3
"1291",5,"  One of the best movies ever made. Reason? Go watch it. Could be one the best movies of our generation.","Ready Player One",1291,3.5,-1.5
"1292",5,"  Absolutely fun to watch, story brilliantly laid out and told, awesome effects and nostalgic pop culture references. Do watch! ????????????","Ready Player One",1292,3.5,-1.5
"1293",5,NA,"Ready Player One",1293,3.5,-1.5
"1294",2,"  I really wanted to enjoy this movie, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, this movie bored me, so much so, I found myself wondering when it would end just so I could leave.","Ready Player One",1294,3.5,1.5
"1295",2.5,"  Anyone who has read the original book and loved it will most likely be disappointed by Spielberg's adaptation. The story has been altered so much that its now a shallow tale, full of plotholes low stakes and deprived of any meaningful emotion","Ready Player One",1295,3.5,1
"1296",3,"  In Ready Player One, though having lots of exposition, Steven Spielberg delivers a wonderfully thrilling first third, but soon afterwards fails to keep the pace and lets the story to gradually succumb to over-reliance on characters and plot twists that were common in 1980s but look sorely outdated and tedious in 2018. This as such is largely in purpose as the story wants to be seen as a tribute to pop-culture - for some reason meaning the 1980s' culture only - but it doesn't make boring the audience any less acceptable. The last real highlight is a magnificent scene in the Shining's hotel.The plot follows characters in the virtual reality and in the real world, jumping back and forth. Action involving the actual people is often poorly staged. Plot rushes from one place to another without much logic. Characters come and go as they please, and it is later difficult to remember what actually happened. The big end fight in the virtual world appears to be staged only because a big end fight needed to be at the end, having no logic, reason or real feeling and bringing nothing new to the long series of purposeless end fights in expensive blockbusters.Hit and miss, and increasingly a miss towards the end, Ready Player One is still a reliable Spielberg that probably will entertain younger audiences more than those who actually remember the 1980s.","Ready Player One",1296,3.5,0.5
"1297",3,"  My 12 year old son and I each read the book. We both loved the book. It was an incredible page turner. A Great Story with many Plot lines and a few twists. The Movie does not do the book justice. The special effects were great. The movie missed the mark on certain elements of the book. Visually the book was much better.","Ready Player One",1297,3.5,0.5
"1298",5,"  Steven Spielberg gives us an electric, exicting and visually stunning glimpse into the near future, breathing fresh life into videogame and Macguffin movies. This is Spielberg going back to doing the type of films we love him for - old-school Spielberg with non-stop action, fun and an exhaustive list of pop culture references that'll make repeated viewings a consistent delight.","Ready Player One",1298,3.5,-1.5
"1299",5,"  This movie is good and awesome","Ready Player One",1299,3.5,-1.5
"1300",5,"  This film is 2h20 of a pure joyride from start to end. I was a little afraid to be underwhelm but it delivers on all front, even the 3D one!","Ready Player One",1300,3.5,-1.5
"1301",5,"  This movie was incredible. I loved every minute.","Ready Player One",1301,3.5,-1.5
"1302",3,"  reality is the only real thing..Ready Player OneThe feature demands attention through highly configured rich details on visual asthetics which is admirable, for despite of having such a large range on the material the makers keep it clean (like coins are used instead of blood when someone is eliminated) and pleasing to the audience. But unfortunately the idea isn't intriguing enough to invest in it, in the first place for it seems like a compilation of different borrowed concepts that may look amazing but feels a bit eerie. Steven Speilberg saves the feature through his brilliant execution skills and projecting the anticipated vision on screen. On performance level, there isn't much range provided to the characters in the plot to express thoroughly but still Taylor Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are convincing and is supported by a great cast like Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg. Ready Player One takes its time in its first act and settles in perfectly before the second act kicks in where everything goes predictable but some throwbacks on old classic features (the quest for the second key is quite amusing) holds you on the seat only to mesmerize you in its third act where the plot enfolds in each phase with some brilliant action sequences and good old drama.","Ready Player One",1302,3.5,0.5
"1303",4,"  Despite it being heavy on plot and may have one too many pop culture references, Spielberg certainly does deliver a visual treat.","Ready Player One",1303,3.5,-0.5

"1305",4,"  Really fun and good gamer movie!","Ready Player One",1305,3.5,-0.5
"1306",0.5,"  Terrible adaptation of the book. Even if you aren't a fan of the book, there are so many plot holes, inconsistencies, and just plain stupidity in this flick that even fantastic CGI can't save it from the wastebin of mediocrity. Spielberg should be embarrassed and Cline should hang his head in shame.","Ready Player One",1306,3.5,3
"1307",5,"  This is not just a film We wanted, this is a film that we need, summing up what it means to not only be a die-hard nerd, but also to back lash corporate that shadows against any culteral community!!! This is one of those films were I had to give my standing ovation. As i always say to myself, ""Geek, and proud""!!!","Ready Player One",1307,3.5,-1.5
"1308",4.5,"  Ready Player One is the most interesting and creative movie to come out in 2018 so far. This is going to go into history with other Steven Spielberg films like E.T. and Jaws. The creativity of this film sparks new ideas and forgotten memories of times when I watched a movie and was blown away. The cast does a amazing job to bring the worlds of the Oasis and the real world together to create this believable performance. I cannot wait for another film like this to come onto the big screen and spark something inside of me.","Ready Player One",1308,3.5,-1
"1309",5,"  Movie was great. its different than the book, but almost all adaptations are. CGI was amazing, characters were great, funny. I'd go watch it a second time if I could.","Ready Player One",1309,3.5,-1.5

"1311",5,"  Super unique and entertaining. One of my new favorites.","Ready Player One",1311,3.5,-1.5
"1312",5,"  (***No Spoilers) Ready Player One is a thrilling ride, a fantastic story layered with so many pop-culture references, with a sprinkling of Spielberg magic to bring this epic fantasy to life. A terrific balance of humour, emotion and for it's subject, a movie that reminds us to also spare some time for the real world. Simply brilliant!","Ready Player One",1312,3.5,-1.5
"1313",4,"  I thought this was a good movie. Bunch of refferences and easter eggs that may be a little baffling to the uninitiated, but over all a well thought out plot smartly written villians and a good cast. Gie it a watch you wont be dissapointed","Ready Player One",1313,3.5,-0.5
"1314",4,"  This is a terrific film to show the work of Steven Speilberg. Also a great way to show how technology is influencing us as a society. It would be a very interesting future but the underlying message for this film is a very human reality.My only issue was that perhaps it could of had a bit more to show of the oasis and the excitement from it. Its totaly an entertaining film, alot of fun!! But i felt towards the end it was a bit childish and soft. Something was missing i'm not sure what it was but overall its a great cinematic adventure showing Speilbergs talent!","Ready Player One",1314,3.5,-0.5
"1315",2.5,"  If you are a fan of the original novel, prepare to be utterly disappointed, you probably won't like this movie interpretation. There is almost ZERO things in common between the novel and the screenplay. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but the things I was expecting or hoping to see never happened. And the challenges to obtain the three keys had ZERO in common with the novel, the process, the character development, the games, relationships...everything down to Wade's time as an indentured servant were completely opposite the novel. The effects were amazing, it was a fun movie all around.... Just don't expect to be able to follow along with the book by any stretch of the imagination. So may key elements were left out, so many interesting tidbits... Money not completely wasted, but it definitely left something to be desired if you enjoyed the novel. One thumb up, one thumb down.","Ready Player One",1315,3.5,1
"1316",5,"  It is missing the first few chapters of the book but that makes sense once you see the movie. They completely changed gate 2, but also understandable. I loved this book and this movie is tremendous. This one is a must see. A whole lot of fun!","Ready Player One",1316,3.5,-1.5
"1317",3.5,"  The movie was not a disappointment. Spielberg managed to once again pull of a successful and visually stunning film. The movie like any movie had its flaws but it was a delight and the positives outweighed all flaws. Although some of the references were pushed in your face such as the tracer reference which showed up 3 times. The classic bat mobile and Harley Quinn references were both subtle and perfect. Overall I really enjoyed the movie and give it a 8/10","Ready Player One",1317,3.5,0
"1318",4.5,"  Ready Player One was one of Spielberg's finest action/adventure films in a while, suited for most ages, action packed from start to finish with 100s of 80s pop culture references. This film created a nostalgic feel that I had not felt for a very long time, not since Tintin in 2011.","Ready Player One",1318,3.5,-1
"1319",2.5,"  It's a movie where you say ""that was neat"" then you go home and do laundry. The horror movie scene was the only interesting thing to me, other than that, it gave me a headache and I was waiting for it to end. This was not an 80's movie, there were 2 or 3 songs in the entire movie. Empty and fake emotional spielbergian corny ending.","Ready Player One",1319,3.5,1
"1320",5,"  Ready Player One is a great film that takes you to another realm of pure imagination with mind blowing experience of Steven Spielberg's magic. It is an enjoyable movie and nostalgic at the same time. There is also a good message at the end of the film that really warms your heart. Everyone should see it!","Ready Player One",1320,3.5,-1.5

"1326",3.5,"  I read the book, and was thoroughly excited to see the movie. The book spoke to me on a geek level I had never experienced before, and with the upcoming movie I was excited to see the various scenes play out on the big screen. Although the movie deviated from the book often, I still found it enjoyable. There were some scenes which I wished could have been included in the film, especially at the end, but did not come to pass. The ending could have been way more spectacular and relevant I think, but still it was an awesome movie, one I will be adding to my already monumental geek movie repertoire.","Ready Player One",1326,3.5,0
"1327",3,"  The best thing about this movie is the astounding amount of easter eggs, but strip them away and you'll see that the king has no SUBSTANCE of its own. Also the 3rd act really dragged with me -- too much pathos, too boring, too generic. I wish I liked it more, but alas, alas. IT'S A CHEWING GUM THAT TASTES GOOD WHILE YOU CHEW IT, BUT LEAVES NO AFTERTASTE.","Ready Player One",1327,3.5,0.5
"1328",5,"  This movie was amazing the graphics were crisp and beautiful . The story didn't follow a single genre in fact it was multiple genres , you had Thriller sequences, Sci fiction background , dystopian , utopian , and romance , also had excellent action sequences, it was also quite comedic. For all those who love 80s pop culture this movie is full of it along with 1990s and 2000s gaming references. The plot was very twisting with a lot of turns, but also had a lesson in the end that gripped the direction we are heading today in virtual reality, and the business side of it. Anyways I think these people who marked it down are really really harsh this movie was fantastic.","Ready Player One",1328,3.5,-1.5
"1329",5,"  LOVED IT!!! If you grew up in the 80's or 90's this is one of the greatest films in a while... FUN FUN FUN","Ready Player One",1329,3.5,-1.5
"1330",0.5,"  Want to start this off by saying that the book is amazing. This film was entirely based on the relationship between the two main characters and missed the mark in terms of storyline and plot. The characters felt 2D and were not believable. Would not recommend anyone watch unless wanting a feel good romance.","Ready Player One",1330,3.5,3
"1331",5,"  Best movie I've seen in a long time. Good guys win, bad guy goes down... Classic Spielberg. Refreshing to see a feel good movie about following your heart and standing up against impossible odds. A visual delight, dont sell yourself short, catch this one on the big screen!!! Thank you to all who helped make this movie what it is! Bravo!","Ready Player One",1331,3.5,-1.5
"1332",5,"  Honestly, I expected a cameo filled movie like this to be, well, nothing but cameos. I expected a weak plot, and weak characters, but was instead thrown down a very exciting and existential rabbit hole. The movie handles the source material very well, and the cgi is absolutely incredible. the movie is a beautiful tribute to new and old pop culture, and is a movie about video games that does the medium justice.","Ready Player One",1332,3.5,-1.5
"1333",5,"  This is how you do a movie. If you have not watched it, you are missing out. Great story, emotional, funny, action packed, and incorporates nostalgic moments from the past. If I had extra thumbs, I would give it more than two thumbs up.","Ready Player One",1333,3.5,-1.5

"1338",2,"  If I hadn't read the book it would have been ok. Even still, it could have and should have been much better. Why almost completely re-write a script from scratch when you don't have to? I would estimate about 80% of this movie is completely fabricated, and not for the better. I was very excited about this film and left pretty disappointed. It reminded me a bit of Ender's Game in that way- epic novel, very forgettable film ??.","Ready Player One",1338,3.5,1.5
"1339",4.5,"  Critics who make it about some political issue which is really not anything new I think the movie is alright. Its not the best movie ever made but it did have a good message that we need to live in reality we have to live in it.","Ready Player One",1339,3.5,-1
"1340",4.5,"  A truly great movie. Fun and well done story telling. I can't wait to see it again. It was a blast!","Ready Player One",1340,3.5,-1
"1341",4.5,"  I loved this movie. The constant Easter eggs and decent main story line made it easily worth the 12 dollars. The love plot line was pointless because of how little time the movie had for development compared to the book. The uncle and aunt of the main protagonist kinda just were there and then disappeared. This should have had more development. Over all this is a great movie for any 80's movie buff or anyone who enjoys arcades.","Ready Player One",1341,3.5,-1
"1342",5,"  Ready Player One is a nostalgic, exciting, and overall fun experience that blows you away.","Ready Player One",1342,3.5,-1.5
"1343",5,"  Really fun movie that has some good improvements over the book and some changes that were a little confusing. As a stand alone movie it's a fun nostalgic film ride that might not be for everyone but if you love 80's pop culture, this was made for you.","Ready Player One",1343,3.5,-1.5

"1348",4,"  You know what this movie reminds me of? Avatar -- the James Cameron flick. Remember that one? It was the movie that essentially added mind-blowing CGI to the plot from Dances With Wolves. It basically took an existing storyline and re-envisioned it using special effects. Ready Player One utilizes this same strategy. Despite it being an adaptation, I'm approaching this movie as a standalone effort from a film perspective. The plot is very basic: an innovation, largely integrated into the human lifestyle and meant to benefit all, is suddenly threatened by a greedy corporation when an opportunity to assume complete control over the product presents itself, and it's up to the heroes to foil the scheme of the power-hungry antagonists. An all-too-familiar plot this is indeed. However, as with Avatar, no fault lies in taking a familiar storyline and presenting it in a new way. Movies have done this for ages. What then makes Ready Player One unique? Again, as with Avatar, the effects are spectacular and wonderfully immersive. What then makes Ready Player One stand apart from Avatar? In my mind, this movie is better than Avatar for a few reasons: 1) the characters are more engaging and memorable; 2) So...Many...References! There are enough quotes, cameos, and tributes, both visual and verbal, obvious and subtle, to spark a myriad of conversations and add some serious re-watch value to this movie; 3) whereas the effects in Avatar are exclusive to its own story/characters, the effects here are incredibly more diverse and encompass an enormous range of characters and designs; and 4) this movie is just ridiculous loads of fun. This is a movie best enjoyed with a big tub of popcorn and your brain switched off. It is a visual spectacle. No thinking required (except for spotting references and ecstatically blaring them out). It also has that signature Spielberg charm and whimsy and even a nice little moral to boot, promoting equal value to our reality and our escapes from it. Overall, the movie achieves exactly what it sets out to be: eye candy that's pure entertainment and a ton of fun.","Ready Player One",1348,3.5,-0.5
"1349",1,"  This movie was almost completely different from the book. I loved the book and was eagerly anticipating the movie. The movie was very very different and not in a good way. I almost walked out.","Ready Player One",1349,3.5,2.5
"1350",5,"  Best movie i have seen at the cinemas for quite some time, i am an avid gamer and i understood all of those references. My Fiance who absolutely has no interest in games loved it.","Ready Player One",1350,3.5,-1.5
"1351",3.5,"  A fun evening at the cinema. The film heavily relies on a wealth of iconography, which sometimes feels as weightless as the VR world we live in, but there's one instance that is impressively designed, giving us new angles to a set most of us have come to know and love.","Ready Player One",1351,3.5,0

"1354",5,"  Way better than expected. Quite a few of my friends said it would be stupid. I disagree. It was great.","Ready Player One",1354,3.5,-1.5
"1355",3.5,"  Strengths: This movie is flat out cool. There are so many nods to pop culture from the past thirty years that you'll need to watch it more than once just to try and spot them all. The visuals are stunning and Steven Spielberg once again shows why he has a penchant for making dazzling blockbusters. Most of the voice work is strong, highlighted by Olivia Cooke (Samantha/Art3mis) and Lena Waithe (Helen/Aech). In fact, they're probably the best parts of the non-CGI scenes, too. The story is simple, but effective. The villain is unlikable and you want to root for the good guys. They're relatable in how they want to escape the harshness of the real world, yet are strong enough to fight to change it. As stated though, the true strengths are the visuals and the references. The Shining scene is great and there were plenty of twists thrown into the story to keep you on the edge of your seat.Weaknesses: Tye Sheridan (Wade/Parzival) is fine as the lead, but doesn't command the screen as much as he should. While his avatar is cool, he does nothing to make you remember him after you finish watching. The romance part of the movie lacks something and feels kind of rushed. The characters get a lot of screen time together, but everything seems to move too quickly. The same goes for the relationship between the creator of OASIS and the girl he had feelings for. I think the challenges that were laid out to win the fortune seemed to be a bit too simple. The riddles were fine, but the actual work it took to complete them lacked. Several characters don't get really fleshed out or developed enough.Overall: Ready Player One is a lot of fun. That goes double for video game players who know their pop culture. You'll enjoy the hell out of it just for each reference you see pop up. The romantic stuff and character development are lacking, while the lead actor isn't great. That being said, there's enough enjoyment and action to make this film a success.","Ready Player One",1355,3.5,0

"1358",4,"  I'm totally not the target audience for ""Ready Player One"" but, then again, Steven Spielberg is considerably older than I am. And, though I generally hate video games, I did like this film. It's not going to go down in history like ""E.T."" or ""Jaws"" or ""Raiders."" But whatever. After being so serious lately it's good to see Spielberg having fun again. The acting is fine (though only new Spielberg favorite Mark Rylance really registers strongly). The score by Alan Silvestri has flickers of John Williams without ever soaring to Williams' magical levels. ""Ready Player One"" is a fine - more than fine - bit of popcorn entertainment that should make a few hundred million worldwide. And it makes one wonder whether there might be another ""E.T."" in the old master to come.","Ready Player One",1358,3.5,-0.5

"1360",4.5,"  A fun adventure immersed in pop culture. In the year 2045, people can escape their harsh reality in the OASIS, an immersive virtual world where you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own imagination. OASIS creator James Halliday left his immense fortune and control of the Oasis to the winner of a contest designed to find a worthy heir. When unlikely hero Wade Watts conquers the first challenge of the reality-bending treasure hunt, he and his friends-known as the High Five-are hurled into a fantastical universe of discovery and danger to save the OASIS and their world.Spielberg, one of the most famous minds in Hollywood, comes out with another film. While his last couple may not have been the best pieces of work, you can still see here that he's still got some left in the tank. And while this film may be boosted just based on references alone, it doesn't negate the fact that I just had fun, and it's the most fun I've had in theater this year. One thing that's fantastic about this film is the animation. The composition, CGI, and animation of this film were all glorious. When I first saw the trailers, I was iffy on it, but when seeing it in the theaters, I was in awe. Everything looked absolutely gorgeous here and it all looked as good as it should have. The film was so smooth and the action sequences were so mesmerizing. There was so much fun to be had in this film and a lot of it came from the beautiful, colorful visuals that appeared on screen. This film, as you can tell from the trailers, is filled with pop culture reference. It's filled with so much pop culture that you probably won't even know you're looking at a reference half the time. It's just impossible to know all of them but when you can see all the small things, it just warms your heart. Everything from the assault rifle from Halo, to the Ninja Turtles kicking ass on Doom Planet, to the Iron Giant fighting for the Oasis, everything is here. I'm shocked at how much rights they had to obtain, albeit some were already owned. Anyways, it was just really fun to see all this pop culture in there, especially when it's showing us just how valuable and inspirational all of this has on society today. In general, this was just a really fun film. The storyline wasn't overly complicated and if anything, it was pretty generic and predictable. The dialogue is fun but it's nothing special. If anything, this movie really is fueled and boosted by the amount of references here. It also feels like it's catered toward kids sometimes as it goes for comedic moments and a cheesy romance instead of going further with its darker themes. Either way, I just couldn't help but smile throughout the entire thing and I can't take away from that.In the end, ""Ready Player One"" was simply just a fun and happy time. I really enjoyed my experience with this film and like I said, it's nowhere near perfect. However, I think this is one of those experiences that you should have in the theater with everyone else. Watch it for the exciting, gritty car racing scenes, hilarious moments, awesome references, epic battles, and exciting adventures. Let yourself smile and enjoy this movie just as I did.","Ready Player One",1360,3.5,-1
"1361",4.5,"  Brought back so many childhood memories great movie.","Ready Player One",1361,3.5,-1
"1362",0.5,"  Ready Player One is a movie about a dystopian future where mankind as a whole has stop trying to solve their real life problems and instead tries to runaway their problem by escaping into a Virtual World call Oasis. I did not enjoy the movie at all because I find the movie to be predictable, boring and none of the characters and entities within the movie are likable or admirable in anyway. The game that the movie revolves around, Oasis, as far as i can tell is a game that is built based on the freeprium or ""pay to win model"" where players can either spend a large amount of time in game to earn virtual currencies in order to buy upgrades or can pay real world money to buy in game upgrades that allows them to get a competitive edge against other players. Players can then compete for relics which then they can resell for large amount of ingame virtual currency which in turn they can use to buy virtual or real world gaming items. Within the movie it seems like it is quite routine for consumers to over stretch their budget in order to buy virtual upgrades that they hope will allow them to win one of these ""relics"". The main character's uncle is one such person who spent their families saving only to lose everything when his virtual character is killed with in the game. As such I have difficulty characterizing the company that made and maintains Oasis as anything other than an evil corporation. While the movie portrayed Nolan Sorrento as the villain of the movie, I personally think the true villain is the creator of Oasis James Halliday. James Halliday is a someone with a god complex who is incapable developing any kind of real connection with his fellow human beings. When told that he need to take responsibility for the unintended negative impact that Oasis has had on mankind, instead of making the necessary changes to Oasis, instead he decided to force out his partner and allow mankind to continue to to fall into the state of disarray. To accelerate the process of decay and get more people to get addicted to his game, upon his death, he created a competition for all Oasis player to search for three keys. The ones who managed to win all three keys inherits all of his fortune which in the movie is said to be about half a trillion dollars. The key to winning all of the competition is not about being smart, or kind, or brave, but rather based on how much you know about the creator of the game. As such the creator create an incentive for the world to essentially study and learn about every facet of his life including his likes and dislikes. By creating the competition he essentially elevated himself into a king or god like status reminiscent of how people in the past would study Mao, Stalin or Hitler. He also incentivizes all the people in the world to invest all their time and energy into playing the game rather than to solve real world problems. While Nolan Sorrento might be responsible for the suffering of thousands and 10s of thousands, James Halliday is responsible for the downfall of the human civilization. The protagonist of the movie is a young adult 18 years old who as far as i can tell doesn't go to school, doesn't go to work, has common sense of a child when it comes to online safety and spends all of his time playing the Oasis game. The protagonist's ability to associate with real people is so poor that he seems to be more concerned about the future of the Oasis game itself than the fact that the evil IOI corporation killed his aunt, uncle and neighbors. In the end the I find protagonist to be extremely unlikable due to the fact that reminds me of someone who is looking for a short cut through life (in his case beating a video game) rather than someone who tries to put together a plan and grind it out in the real world through honest work. Storyline was paper thin and extremely predictable. The world that is created by the movie is incredibly depressing and none of the characters are really likable. Even after the near 3 hour movie, neither the world nor protagonist went through any kind of transformation for the better and instead the protagonist was handsomely rewarded despite his naivety and poor decisions in life and god knows how many people's life savings were completely wiped out due the event of the movie.","Ready Player One",1362,3.5,3
"1363",3.5,"  Well produced and adapted from the beloved novel, this film marks a return to director Steven Spielberg's fun side.

"1371",5,"  Ready, Player One is a fantastic film. In it a young man, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) , races through both the virtual world of the Oasis and the real world with his friends, including Samantha (Olvia Cooke), to solve the puzzle that will reward him with control of the Oasis. The Oasis is the virtual reality world that the majority of the Earth's populace uses to escape the humdrum life on an overpopulated, polluted planet. Everyone is competing against a powerful corporation that wants to control the Oasis, monetizing it to extremes. It's a glorious ride. Anything is possible in the Oasis and director Steven Spielberg makes full use of this. He lets loose his imagination and reworks the original novel, matching up fictional worlds and characters like you always wanted to as kids, in an exhilarating orgy of excitement and mayhem. Where else will you get the Iron Giant, Mecha Godzilla and Chuckie the killer doll all in one film? The only complaint I have with the film is that most of the villains are a tad too generic. Big corporations are bad. Companies see the population as nothing but tools to use to raise profits. And the company's head, Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) is so slimy that all he is missing is a mustache to twirl. Thankfully the heroes are well enough defined to keep me interested in seeing how they win. You can be whoever you want to be in the Oasis. Men can be women, children can be adults, wimps can be race car drivers, whatever you want. Your imagination is the limit. You know what the ending will be, but it's nothing that stands in the way of having so much fun that I can't wait to see the film again.","Ready Player One",1371,3.5,-1.5

But at the end of the film I did not feel wow he was just a nice movie.The film was mesmerizing and I could not stop looking for Easter Pear.Across the Internet they wanted a lot of criticism because of the huge amount of Easter pear in the film people did not enjoy the film but I do not agree! Hester Pearce only added to the film's experience. It was fun to look in every corner and face for our favorite accessories and figures.The film is suitable for any age and any type of geek whether you are a gamer or a movie lover or a technology lover and an enthusiast.","Ready Player One",1387,3.5,-0.5
"1388",5,"  This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Spielberg has successfully bridged the gap between gaming and video game cultures. You needn't be a gamer to enjoy this fantasy movie. I actually spent the whole movie with a smile on my face this was so amazing. If i could afford it i'd keep going to the theater to watch it in IMAX 3D. This is definitely a movie to see in IMAX if you can. Because it truly shines on the big screen in 3D. I truly can't rave about this movie enough. Go, take friends, tell people about your experience. This movie needs to be seen. The moral of this movie couldn't ring more true in today's time; we need to connect more with the people around us. So share this movie with someone you love. :)","Ready Player One",1388,3.5,-1.5
"1389",4.5,"  The book was awesome and this movie was really enjoyable. A lot of 80's and 80's moments! I will definitely see this again and buy the movie.","Ready Player One",1389,3.5,-1
"1390",5,"  A well-done film, to me, is one that keeps me purely entertained, doesn't contain many, if any, plot holes, is finely acted, and keeps me positively engaged. This is that type of film. The one thing to remember: this is a pure fantasy-type film. However, the real-world ridiculousness of corporate entities spending tons of money just to earn tons more money, at the expense of anyone and anything, is purely evident here. And the cliched ""little people"" against the ""big people"" theme is certainly played out here. But it works and it works really well. I love the fact that this movie used relative unknowns for all of the major roles. I was only familiar with Tye from the X-Men movie. Simon, I'm a huge fan of, but he wasn't a main character. The others, I've never seen before. The American accents from Ben and Simon were perfect. This movie kept me completely engaged from the word ""go"". Its pace kept my adrenaline going and its homages to the 80's were perfection, though it is hard for me to fathom that no other significant anthem songs were released between 1980 and 2045. This movie was pure entertainment, for entertainment purposes. And I absolutely loved it.","Ready Player One",1390,3.5,-1.5
"1391",5,"  One of best movies I've ever seen, some people say it wasn't as good but they just don't understand what the movie is really about","Ready Player One",1391,3.5,-1.5
"1392",4,"  This film looks spectacular and had me smiling throughout. Loved a load of the references. There was a few plot hole's and questionable actions in the film but nothing major.","Ready Player One",1392,3.5,-0.5
"1393",3,"  While Ready Player One delivers some spectacular Spielbergian visuals, it fails to capture the pathos of its source material.","Ready Player One",1393,3.5,0.5
"1394",3.5,"  Deep inside I want to give it a 10/10, but I have to point out the flaws and be truthful with my rating. I felt the movie fell apart around the sending squence in the real world. Awesome movie overall though.","Ready Player One",1394,3.5,0
"1395",4.5,"  I really enjoyed this movie, it was so fun to catch all the different references to games, movies and everything 80's. I have read the book numerous times and think this is a great addition to the Ready Player One options. I think Speilberg did a great job of keeping the underlying theme of the book as the core of the movie.","Ready Player One",1395,3.5,-1
"1396",1,"  For an actual story, and not a brainless string of action sequences, read the book of the same name.","Ready Player One",1396,3.5,2.5
"1397",2.5,"  I have read the book. I am attempting to separate the two for the purpose of this review. tl;dr - It's a fun movie with lots of action. The main character is boring and the plot is a series of Dues Ex Machinas and straight up plot holes coinciding to form a resolution.Pros: Movie is fun. It has genuine laughs, thrills, and chills. The references are cool without feeling like advertising (mostly) and the acting is solid. The Oasis is gorgeous to look at and the action is amazing in 3d. Definitely see this in 3d if you can spring for it. The race is exactly as cool as the trailer implies and a Gundam fights Mechagodzilla with the Iron Giant which is pretty dope.Cons: Not clever at all. Wade is a generic everyman protagonist with the motivation of One Punch Man played straight instead of for laughs. Cooke shines and the movie should have been about her. Art3mis is more interesting than Wade by a wide margin. The final battle is cool, but there is so much more that could be done. Instead we see Wade driving around in his Delorian shooting various weapons out the window while seeing glimpses of other characters from various worlds who are probably doing much cooler stuff. Also in that previously mentioned Iron Giant + Gundam Vs Mechagodzilla fight the protagonist is none of those which should really disqualify him from being the protagonist. In the interest of spoilers I'm not going to go into detail about all the plot holes that exist in this movie, but there are a lot.Also if you haven't read the book, wait until you've seen the movie. You'll probably enjoy it more.","Ready Player One",1397,3.5,1
"1398",0.5,"  This is the movie that gets made when IOI wins. All of the character that made the book's quest and players interesting was changed for no discernible reason.","Ready Player One",1398,3.5,3
"1399",0.5,"  Spielberg is an embarrassment.","Ready Player One",1399,3.5,3
"1400",5,"  very good movie fun and interesting","Ready Player One",1400,3.5,-1.5
"1401",2.5,"  Good message but a violent sensory assault","Ready Player One",1401,3.5,1
"1402",4,"  Louise & me enjoyed this. I think it helps that we were around in the 80s and there's nods to Akira, Gundam Wing and Mecha Godzilla...I know, cool memories and Nostalgia do not a film make, but it was an entertaining yarn too..Won't lie though, the Shinning & Alien references seemed a little extreme.-hilarious, but extreme.","Ready Player One",1402,3.5,-0.5
"1403",4.5,"  As far as adaptations go, I've rarely seen a movie make so many changes to the source material. Every trial was changed, the characters look different, that plot was massively altered... about the only thing that's book accurate are the character's names and races. Somehow, in spite of all of that, Ready Player One managed to capture the heart of the book in a way that more faithful adaptations so rarely do.In both novel and movie form, Ready Player One is a love letter to nerd culture. Almost every scene in the movie is packed with references to movies, video games, and comic books. I managed to catch Raven from Teen Titans in some street art at one point and I'm sure I missed a thousand other references hidden in the background. This is the kind of movie people are going to go through frame by frame to catch everything and they'll still miss stuff!But while all that's great, what is this story actually about and is the plot any fun?Imagine that the richest man in the world loves video games and is brilliant at creating them. Then imagine that man dies, only instead of leaving his wealth to his heirs, he creates a treasure hunt in his greatest video game with all his wealth going to the person who completes the hunt first.This is Ready Player One and, no matter which version you pick, it's a blast from start to finish. The movie also gets the rare honor of being of equal quality to the book in this reader's eyes. While the book's treasure hunt was better due to the fact that it could be drawn out over several hundred pages instead of having to be summed up in two hours, the movie had a better sense of humor and the characters were a lot more fun and fleshed out because it's no longer a first-person story. The movie also vastly improved upon the book's romance, which was a massive drawback for me and many of the novel's critics. It's still not a love for the ages, but it went from cringe-worthy-at-best to harmless fluff.If you enjoy video games, nerdy movies, or even just stunning visuals, then Ready Play One is well worth your time. While I'd probably give this a 4/5 for plot, characters, and humor, I'm bumping it up to a 5/5 for the insane amount of effort put into pumping this thing full of Easter eggs for viewers to find. Those elements take a decent movie and make it something that I'd happily watch several times over, if only to see if I can spot something that I missed the last time I watched it.If you do enjoy the movie, I would recommend giving the book a shot. As I said before, its romance side-plot has some major issues, but main story is strong enough that I could look past it. I was also really glad that I'd read it while watching the movie because this one movie very fast and I think my background knowledge made the plot a lot easier to follow.","Ready Player One",1403,3.5,-1
"1404",4,"  Ready Player One is a unique, dazzling, innovative story come to life on the big screen. Filled with '80's pop culture references, Spielberg's newest blockbuster delivers a fun time at the movies. It wasn't the most amazing or in-depth movie in the world, but its message was clear, and its storyline wacky, crazy, and exciting. It was a wild ride that serves as a solid and visually dazzling flick that will entertain many, whether you grew up in the '80's or not.","Ready Player One",1404,3.5,-0.5
"1405",1.5,"  the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title. Is a shitty adolescent movie with a videogame skin","Ready Player One",1405,3.5,2
"1406",5,"  Amazing recommend it","Ready Player One",1406,3.5,-1.5
"1407",5,"  A love song dedicated to every 80's child. I was smiling ear to ear through the entire movie. Yes, 'the book was better'', but this movie enhanced the book in so many ways. I will be buying a copy of this when it comes out. To not only watch for fun, but to try and enjoy all the 'Easter eggs' I missed. The sad part is the fact a sequel is not feasible.","Ready Player One",1407,3.5,-1.5
"1408",4.5,"  Awesome movie with so many Easter eggs i lost count!","Ready Player One",1408,3.5,-1
"1409",3.5,"  It's a fun movie, not amazing, but really fun. Really gave off a classic vibe in terms of story-telling and acting to the point that it felt like I was watching an 80s film made with modern technology. I never read the book though, and at times I wasn't sure if there were some things I was missing out on due to the fact (although my friends who did read the book mentioned that the film and book are very different). I'd recommend this as a fun movie though. Great visuals, fun 80s vibe, and tons of easter eggs.ps. without giving away too much I really enjoyed the second key challenge ;)","Ready Player One",1409,3.5,0
"1410",1,"  As a stand alone film I would have enjoyed it. As a film adaptation of a book it was abismal. They threw away the soul of the book. What garbage.","Ready Player One",1410,3.5,2.5
"1411",4.5,"  A really fun movie, and i cannot see why anyone would criticize it based on its visuals and fun nostalgia. Really fun time, want to see it again.","Ready Player One",1411,3.5,-1
"1412",5,"  another brilliant movies by steven Spielberg , loved the plot, great acting and awesome visual effect definitely will watching again!","Ready Player One",1412,3.5,-1.5
"1413",3,"  A non stop wave of nostalgia inducing ""easter eggs"" and product placements. A story that is simple, with little character development, some good humorous moments and is akin to that of Harry Potter or Hunger games, and themes similar to Sword Art Online. Really there is nothing new or lasting in this movie. It completely relies on its references and is very forgettable.","Ready Player One",1413,3.5,0.5
"1414",3.5,"  Run-of-the-mill adventure movie with thrilling visual effects. 60% of the movie is CGI, so only watch it if you're into that sort of thing. It's a fun movie for all ages, even with the references to pop culture and video games from the 80s/90s.","Ready Player One",1414,3.5,0
"1415",5,"  99.8%.Its not for everyone. But for me, this was the greatest movie experience of my entire life. All the games I grew up playing on the big screen in one more, presented in an incredible way. I cannot express in words what this was like. I often use this one analogy when I describe what going to Comic-Con is like for people who have never been to one -- ""It's like a child going to the zoo and seeing animals for the first time"" - well that is sort of what this movie was like for me. I remember when one character says the words, ""I choose the form of ... Gundam"" I literally jumped out of my seat and started clapping. This was ... this was everything. I would legitimately even see this again (except I'm going to opt for maybe buying it on DVD when it becomes available because there were about 100 easter eggs in it that i'd love to find). Other than being incredibly rich with amazing video game and pop culture references, Ready Player One is an incredible movie on its own. While it won't be nearly as enjoyable to non-gamers, It has a fantasic storyline and lots of action that any fan of action/adventure films will enjoy. Without delving too deep into it, in 2025 a man creates the first working Fully Virtual Reality (VR) world just in the nick of time as the world's resources were being depleted and life was looking glum. In 2047, the creator of this incredible virtual world where you can be anyone and do anything (much like the tv series Caprica) passes away and informs players that he has hidden an easter egg in the game and whoever finds it will be able to change the world in their own image as well as inherit his half a trillion dollars worth of stock. A company called IOI or Innovative Online Industries restructures their entire company to trying to find the keys to unlock the easter egg in the virtual world and remake it in their image - one rules by advertisements. The movie focuses on an average young man, and avid gamer, who knows everything there is to know about the VR world's creator and ends up finding the first key - inciting IOI to come after him in real life. Well I would not necessarily recommend this movie to anyone over 45, for all others ... this is as good as it gets people. This is entertainment.","Ready Player One",1415,3.5,-1.5
"1416",5,"  Speilberg magic should be 98 percente d of your saying that fucking beetle juice is better than this fuck of your not critics you fucking morans you haven't better seen films","Ready Player One",1416,3.5,-1.5
"1417",4,"  Pretty good adaptation of one of my favorite books. Of course they took some liberties but it would have been hard to include all of the detail (especially about the games and game history) in a two hour nineteen minute movie. If you can suspend with expectations tied to the book it's really enjoyable.","Ready Player One",1417,3.5,-0.5
"1418",2.5,"  Save your money on this one. Premise was a tron ripoff. It's hard to swallow credulity while trying to watch because you have to suspend so much disbelief as to make this a very juvenile movie. If you'r e under 12 go see it, if not, skip it.","Ready Player One",1418,3.5,1
"1419",1.5,"  Poor follow through and script that doesn't make sense.","Ready Player One",1419,3.5,2
"1420",4.5,"  Amazing film! All of the references it's like a video game/movie fanatic's wet dream. My personal favorite is the Stephen King 'The Shining' scene. Absolutely phenomenal. Definitely didn't think I would like it at first after seeing the trailer, but I'll definitely say after seeing the movie I love it. 100% recommend seeing this. Steven Spielberg did it again.","Ready Player One",1420,3.5,-1
"1421",4,"  Overall I enjoyed it, but they really detracted from the book. There were some pretty awkward moments, but there were some great ones as well. I don't want to get into spoilers, but I wish there were puzzles to find the gates instead of it showing up once they grabbed the keys. Need to watch it over and over to see most of the hidden characters.","Ready Player One",1421,3.5,-0.5
"1422",5,"  it was a thrilling action romance movie, with many twist and turns i would recamend it to all.","Ready Player One",1422,3.5,-1.5
"1423",5,"  Such a great experience! So many funny moments and so many Easter Eggs and references to other games and movies! Brought back so many memories! The screen write is so good. You can't do less than cheer all the time for the main characters! It's great movie for people that grew playing video games and that are aware of the pop culture!","Ready Player One",1423,3.5,-1.5

"1429",3.5,"  Enjoyed the movie, great fun. Not overly complicated, but wish Sorrento was a lil more of a competent and less inept villian. Would have made the ending more satisfying. Also, wish they included the nostalgic parts a bit more other than the quick flashes in the mega-battle scene at the end. But as a 80's baby, I really enjoyed it and had a good time.","Ready Player One",1429,3.5,0
"1430",4.5,"  Even though this movie is much different from the book, I still found it very fun and well done. The virtual reality world is amazing to be in and the reality world is not overly depressing like so many recent movies. Great humor and incredible action. I highly recommend it.","Ready Player One",1430,3.5,-1
"1431",5,"  T'was a jolly good showwww","Ready Player One",1431,3.5,-1.5
"1432",5,"  One of the best movies I have see in recent times. Absolutely fantastic.. Must watch for a gamer. I would compare this movie to avatar where people are taken to a different world to experience the magic that can only happen with cgi, GREAT MOVIE!!!!!","Ready Player One",1432,3.5,-1.5
"1433",5,"  Lives up to the high standard of the book. The changes made helped immensely with the flow and level of suspense. All I want to do is sit and pause the movie to soak in all of the characters spanning across so many franchises in every scene. This was honestly a movie I thought would never work because of all the licensing issues they would have, but they pulled it off and pulled it off masterfully.","Ready Player One",1433,3.5,-1.5
"1434",3.5,"  good movie but cringy and has too many dumb cameos from game characters that arent relevant also it was pretty predictable some parts were interesting thought and the visuals were good but will probably not be as good as game graphics in 2045","Ready Player One",1434,3.5,0
"1435",4.5,"  As a gamer and someone who has read the book I loved the movie. So did my gamer wife and 12 year old daughter. My 5 year old wasn't so interested in it. I give it a 8+ out of 10. The book is intriguing while the movie is action. Two very different but both are awesome.","Ready Player One",1435,3.5,-1
"1436",4,"  Visually an Epic Pastiche of a Nerd's 80's and 90's Memorabilia collection made onto film. Action scenes are well made, and CG is well crafted, although at times you feel like you are a watching a Video Game cinematic, but this seems to be done on purpose. The story albeit generic, is well crafted in its arcs, and though it suffers from some less than ideal acting specially in the ""real world"", it makes for an entertaining and fun pop-corn flick.","Ready Player One",1436,3.5,-0.5
"1437",3,"  Very intense visuals, beautifully rendered. Some of the story didn't make sense to me, had that ""you just have to accept it"" type of feel. Very very very corny, I could see mostly anyone 30 or under cringing at some of the scenes. A few of the pop culture references and other video game references were pretty clever and done nicely.Didn't like the way the relationship between two of the main characters felt so forced and quick paced. I cringed every time they made moves on each other, the whole time I thought it was one sided and that one person was using the other person but it turned out to be sincere. Also didn't understand how a corporation could get away with terrorism within the borders of the US (in broad daylight) several times. The authorities never showed their face until the cliche last moment, saving the plot from becoming an actual tragedy. I never read the book, I'm wondering if my opinions would be any different. I feel like I lot of meat was cut out in order to produce something that'd make sense.","Ready Player One",1437,3.5,0.5
"1438",2.5,"  I understand liberties have to be taken when converting a book to a movie, especially one that requires so much licencing. But it was hardly the same story. Why was this movie even made? Boring and disappointing. It felt rushed and incomplete. It had a lack of mystery, imagination, and adventure, as well as character development. Everything felt undeserved. Plus, though the OASIS scenes were cool, I really wasn't that impressed, and they still often felt like a clusterf. Also there were so many plot holes and impossibilities in the story and characters, even in a movie like this, that I was kind of annoyed.","Ready Player One",1438,3.5,1
"1439",4,NA,"Ready Player One",1439,3.5,-0.5
"1440",4,"  Really enjoyed it! Captured much of the spirit of the book, while changing almost all the references. Still great to see how many they were able to make! A few missed opportunities from the book that I thought would have really fit their message and story, but great none the less :)","Ready Player One",1440,3.5,-0.5
"1441",1,"  Really really bad. Nothing makes any sense. The protagonist and antagonist's motivations are pretty much non existent, there are no stakes, it's not even entertaining. Don't see.","Ready Player One",1441,3.5,2.5
"1442",5,"  gran pelicula del 2018","Ready Player One",1442,3.5,-1.5
"1443",3.5,"  3.5 stars. Impressively ambitious to a fault, and fills up just enough pop culture references to leave room for a fun story. As far as a dystopian film however, its unoriginality is both its greatest strength and its biggest weakness.","Ready Player One",1443,3.5,0
"1444",1.5,"  If only Spielberg wrote The Matrix. RP1 has a much simpler and current understanding of vertual reality. Those who discredit this film because it's too nostalgic miss the point. The nostalgia makes the film fun and watchable for those of us 44 year olds and helps us remember the 80's with fondness. This is deliberate and makes the film so enjoyable to watch, even if the film does appear juvenile in a world that takes itself too seriously.","Ready Player One",1444,3.5,2
"1445",1,"  I don't even know where to begin with this movie, this movie is just a gigantic disappointment before this movie came out i decided to read the book before watching the movie. Then i went and watched the movie excited about how Spielberg was going to recreate this engaging plot with 3 dimensional characters with all the 80's references and everything like that. NOTHING FROM THE BOOK WAS UTILISED i swear to god i had my hand in my head throughout the movie thinking about how i paid real money to watch some cgi playground with no meaning at all. I don't even know how people are praising this movie? It's either they haven't read the book (which i recommend they do, it's a great book) or they are the type of people who watch movies and get bored when there is no explosions and cars crashing into each other to listen to 5 minutes of character development. I am just extremely disappointed in this movie the movie doesn't even suck it's just a mediocre movie that will probably be forgotten as ""that movie about video games and 80's stuff"""" instead of being remembered as a thought provoking movie like inception.The reason i gave this movie a one star and not like two is because i was expecting a lot form Spielberg especially when he was one of my favourite directors until well you know this thing came out. I don't know what he was thinking was out of greed and pure laziness or is it because he didn't know how to approach a movie like this. It's like he ripped out pages of the book dumped them into a bag picked out 5 random pages and said ""Yeah let's put this in the movie"" and dumped the rest of the pages.I am just gonna end this review/rant of how the movie sucked and say just read the book and skip this movie.","Ready Player One",1445,3.5,2.5
"1446",4,NA,"Ready Player One",1446,3.5,-0.5
"1447",4,"  I was disappointed in some of the plot choices Spielberg made in comparison with the book, though i realize some of the detailed 80's pop culture references in the book had to be extracted to fit the knowledge base of a larger movie going audience. Biggest disappointment was making the real world main characters too attractive. Art3mis was supposed to have a much more promiment birthmark, and Wade was supposed to be pasty and chubby. Both details from the book fit the plot better than the more attractive movie counterparts. Overall, I am delighted to have one of my favorite books made into a movie by one of the greatest directors of all time.","Ready Player One",1447,3.5,-0.5
"1448",2,"  A cheap celebration childhood popculture namedropping carried badly by a cliché story and flat characters. Everyone under 21 will love this sloppy pile of overhyped Bantha poo. We'll soon forget about this one.","Ready Player One",1448,3.5,1.5
"1449",5,"  Super fun and if you have enjoyed video games and pop culture over the last 40 years then you will love all the references. If you havent it is still a ton of fun.","Ready Player One",1449,3.5,-1.5
"1450",4,"  Lots of great characters and visual effects. Some plot holes but it's an entertaining movie. It's basically a 2 hour PSA to put down our digital addictions and unplug every once in a while.","Ready Player One",1450,3.5,-0.5
"1451",3,"  Fun adventure film with a lot of pop culture references.","Ready Player One",1451,3.5,0.5
"1452",4.5,"  If you've read the book, don't expect it to be like the book, at all. Treat it as an alternate telling of the story, like how the new Battlestar Galactica was quite different from the old, yet still amazing. That's what Ready Player One is. Very different, but still a must see. If you're in your 40's and were into geeky stuff, this is like a heartfelt homage to your childhood. I was grinning throughout and felt like a kid again!","Ready Player One",1452,3.5,-1
"1453",4,"  Muy buena pelicula, se entiende muy bien lo que desea explicar. La pelicula demuestra a lo que puede llegar a ser la sociedad actual en un futuro y como perderiamos la consiencia de la realidad inconcientemente.En terminos de estetica... la verdad es que la pelicula aplica muy bien los efectos y las escenas actuadas, la bajo un poco por detalles tales como reflejos, enfoque de luz, errores de actuacion los cuales son muy minimos.Pero en si genial pelicula, perfecta para ir jovenes con sus amigos. No la recomiendo para adultos ya que implica temas que ellos actualmente capáz que no los entiendan.Muy recomendada.","Ready Player One",1453,3.5,-0.5
"1454",4,"  Very entertaining. A good story accompanied by lots of 80s references. iT'S DEFINITELY WORTH YUOR TIME TO WATCH IT. i GREW UP IN THE 80S AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SEE IT. mY 10 YEAR OLD ENJOYED IT AS WELL SO THIS IS A MOVIE ALL AGES CAN ENJOY.","Ready Player One",1454,3.5,-0.5
"1455",1,"  Fans of the book beware, the floor will surely fall from under you like the final scene in the movie... This movie is at best an adaptation of the book, it differs so much in some respects that it alters the story completely... if you like gaming, and were young during the 80's and have only seen the movie, do yourself the favor and read the book.","Ready Player One",1455,3.5,2.5
"1456",4.5,"  Steven Spielberg had a huge influence on my love for movies. Recently, last 10 years i have noticed that recent movies are technically good, but kind of old-fashioned and without spark. Ready Player One brought that spark for me. Of course, Im in love with pop culture and pop culture references that contain this movie and novel, it was to be expected. I was afraid that Spielberg will be lost in too much CGI, virtual world Oasis, but i was wrong, that was even the most entertaining and convincing part of this movie. And yes i know, there should be corny sweet moments as it is movie for grown up kids, and new generation of kids, but i didn't mind those moments, it doesn't go overboard with it. Ready Player 1 is the cutest film i have seen this year, made me smile all throughout, it is a movie for movie geeks, nerds brought up in the 80s and 90s. Absolute gem, feel good movie of the year.","Ready Player One",1456,3.5,-1
"1457",5,"  An absolute delight and a lovely adaptation of the book! Once again, Spielberg brings out the charm and skillfully applies it to geek culture and gamer communities! (So many Batman and Overwatch gems, I love it!)","Ready Player One",1457,3.5,-1.5
"1458",4,"  The biggest problem with Ready Player One is that the references are mostly confined to pop culture from the 80s and 90s. In the universe, it would make a sort of sense that the devotees to the Oasis and to James Halliday would consume the same content Halliday did, despite this taking place 60 years after all of those pop culture references. But the downside is that tweens and teenagers would find this movie almost completely inaccessible (how many 13-year-olds have seen The Shining?).No, this movie is for the kids of the 80s and 90s, the ones who grew up with Buckaroo Banzai but consider the Bee Gees ""old school"" even if they're technically only a few years apart. The laughs and exhilaration were genuine from me, and there were so many things to notice that it made me want to see it again just for the sake of making sure I didn't miss anything. This is a movie without much depth but with lots of spectacle. It's a movie that capitalizes on nostalgia without digging deeper. It builds a virtual world and ignores the real one. It's a movie with characters that are two-dimensional but relatable. In other words, it's just like an 80s movie.(Note: I didn't read the book. Any responses that include the phase ""in the book..."" will be ignored and dismissed; this is a movie review, not a book review.)","Ready Player One",1458,3.5,-0.5

"1462",4,"  Although set in Ohio in 2045, Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" opens with Van Halen's 1984 ""Jump"". Puzzling, and the nostalgia eventually reveals in the screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline, based on Cline's book. Most of ""Ready Player One"" is set in the virtual world OASIS, where you can game as your avatar. The movie is a visual marvel to behold. Yet, source material leave something to be desired. And at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's at least 30 minutes too long. Great message gets lost in aftermath.","Ready Player One",1462,3.5,-0.5

"1468",1,"  Utter garbage! If you read the book, you're sure to be greatly disappointed. Spielberg basically gutted the entire flick and made it ready to see adaptation of what amounts to a Disney flick. Everything that was good about the book was destroyed.

"1472",4,"  Movie was very good. If you read the book and expect to see it on screen, you will be disappointed. Go and enjoy it for itself, independent of the book. There are great references and nostalgia. They will move fast though, so be prepared. There is one mildly scary part that was not in the book based on a popular horror movie. Younger children may be scared.","Ready Player One",1472,3.5,-0.5
"1473",2,"  This movie is mediocre at best. Whilst the special effects are impressive and there are lots of references, that is where the good things about this movie end. There is no character development and the plot is both predictable and tedious.","Ready Player One",1473,3.5,1.5

"1475",3,"  If you haven't read the book, I'm sure you'll find this movie really fun and enjoyable. It's probably a 4.5 star movie. If you HAVE read the book, this movie is NOT the book. I'd give it 2.5 stars, but I'll round up to 3. It has the spirit of the story, but lacks the soul of the book. All the references and things in the book that had an old nerd like me, turning pages, were replaced by things, that I assume, have a broader audience. As much as I understand the need for brevity in film adaptations, this isn't that. This is ""inspired by"" not ""based on"".","Ready Player One",1475,3.5,0.5

"1478",4.5,"  I went into this film with no real expectations or knowledge of what this film was about (beyond the commercials). A few of my friends had read the book, and I was just along for the ride. I have to say I was genuinely impressed with this movie from start to finish. This film is a box office movie, but feels like a cult-classic film with all the old movie/ video-game references. I can see this being a film that many die-hards will watch over and over for years to come. The film does a incredible job with the following:1. Establishing meaningful characters in a short amount of time. 2. A near perfect flow to the movie; balancing action, character build, and comedy. 3. Creating an interesting and tense plot/ story4. AMAZING nostalgic touches (you gamers know what I'm talking about).5. Top-notch CGI, sound and action. This is a 7.5/10 film overall, a 9/10 for action/ CGI, and a 10/10 for entertainment. There was never a moment in this movie where I felt bored or lost (aka no The Last Jedi casino scene). The actors/ actresses were genuine and filled their respective roles nicely. The ONLY complaint I have is the end feeling a little cheesy, but that is pretty common for a movie like this. For my friends that read the book, they said the movie is very different in certain respects, but that being the case, they still loved it. Enjoy!","Ready Player One",1478,3.5,-1
"1479",0.5,"  Bad bad baaaad film.","Ready Player One",1479,3.5,3
"1480",3,"  Ready Player One has great cgi and the 3D effects are impressive at times. Its retro 80s theme unfortunately also applies to the flat characters and plotting. It doesn't make use of its semi-dystopian future to warn us about some end-game effects of current technologies or social trends. You don't care about the good guys or their quest, there are no politics - just a generic incompetent bad guy who should be a stand-in for something larger than personal ambition. History is flattened to mere pop culture nostalgia. The moral of the story is to only game 5 days a week, I guess, because reality, is, like, real...?","Ready Player One",1480,3.5,0.5
"1481",2.5,"  The movie almost never lives up to the book, but this was so far off it is ridiculous. The movie felt rushed and never gave you the time to care for the characters. Should have been multiple movies and needed better casting.","Ready Player One",1481,3.5,1
"1482",4,"  A fun, multi-generational film with heart and soul.","Ready Player One",1482,3.5,-0.5
"1483",5,"  A great celebrating to my childhood","Ready Player One",1483,3.5,-1.5
"1484",4.5,"  An exciting movie with great characters and thrilling action. Speilberg's talents really show here as the movie is directed fantastically. The special effects is fantastic and the references are just icing on the cake. The story is interesting and never stops moving. The pacing is excellent however there are some scenes that lack when compared to other scenes such as the dance scene and the final chase scene.","Ready Player One",1484,3.5,-1
"1485",5,"  Amazing, exciting, and stunning. Spielberg did it again.","Ready Player One",1485,3.5,-1.5
"1486",1,"  Very disappointed... not sure why there is such a high rating. Bad acting, bad adaptation of the book, and thin characters. Made for a painful watching experience, save for an exciting moment here or there.","Ready Player One",1486,3.5,2.5
"1487",1,"  Cliche story with poorly written world, bland characters with awful dialogue, forgettable action scenes (except for maybe the first one) and almost no soundtrack. A surprisingly unfun and cringe movie. Spielberg really didn't try very hard on this one.","Ready Player One",1487,3.5,2.5
"1488",4,"  It was fun to watch.","Ready Player One",1488,3.5,-0.5
"1489",4,"  Great movie! Saw it this weekend, good family-ish movie with the now required for a PG-13 movie single F-bomb. I did not read the book, but according to the person behind us, "" it was nothing like the book!"" All in all a fun movie and worth seeing.","Ready Player One",1489,3.5,-0.5
"1490",4,"  Full disclosure, I did NOT read the book...yet. Ready Player One is a movie tailored to a generation. I sat there and watched countless references to games, movies, TV shows, and books of old zip past me in a rush of nostalgia. It was fun! I grew up in the thick of all this material, so seeing it on the silver screen in some form had me giddy. And while this was all good fun, the story does not suffer (too much) with the saturation of call-backs. However, for someone like my father who sat next to me and probably didn't have the slightest clue as to what many of the newer references were (outside the movies or books), he was still able to give me the stamp of approval, ""it was better than I expected.""Steven Spielberg has made it a habit to excel with kid/teenage actors and stories that circulate around them. Yet again, we find ourselves following another teen, Wade Watts, in his battle for the future. Set in 2045, we get a future dystopian society, which resembles something more of what we see today with all the Virtual Reality headsets and technology than I think Spielberg wants you to think. While the actual Oasis itself is far fetched from a technical standpoint, kids these days are already part of a massive multiplayer online experience. Spielberg is only reinforcing values and stigmas in this fictional world that we currently see today, and his not-so-subtle message toward the end about staying grounded in reality instead of wandering infinitely in the VR world feels like a parental word of guidance rather than a command.The acting is marginally forgettable. Tye Sheridan is a bit stiff and doesn't quite come off as the full-fledged nerd we are supposed to believe him to be. Olivia Cooke offers a bit more personality as the first supporting character. Ben Mendelsohn is born to play villains hot off the heels from his Rogue One performance from a few years ago and Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg only bolster the otherwise unknown cast.So while the acting isn't necessarily why you come to see RPO, the CGI and effects certainly are the reason. They are flawless. I saw it in 3D. It's not Avatar (has anything really ever matched that?), but for a 'video game' movie, this had all the added bonuses of seeing everything in crisp, clear, 3D rendering. There's almost a point when you feel the movie coming to a close after the climactic boss battle where you wish another hour of just references took place. Too many to list. So while RPO offers up tons of nostalgia to the right people, it still gives you a solid movie to boot even if you can't recognize every single reference over the slightly long 2 hour and 20 minute run time. Spielberg's filmography is chock full of adventures like this, and this is just another solid staple to pin his name to.","Ready Player One",1490,3.5,-0.5
"1491",5,"  This movie basically represents my childhood. I fell in love with it the minute I saw the opening credits. This movie had everything, and it was spectacular. I wish there are more movies like this in the future.","Ready Player One",1491,3.5,-1.5
"1492",3.5,"  Good not Great. I did enjoy the movie but I just felt like it was missing something. Overall it is a fun movie and visually it will blow you away. I just never felt like I understood how it felt to live in the world of the oasis. Needed more scenes like the shinning and the club. Go watch it you will be happy you did on the big screen.","Ready Player One",1492,3.5,0
"1493",1.5,"  The endless stream of references made the movie seem cheesy and really devoid of any substance. That was a bit confusing to me considering that one of the things that I loved about the book was the endless stream of references; however, having a couple of days to reflect on it, I realized that the difference in my reactions to the references in the movie and the book really boils down to the fact that the references were a major plot point in the book. In the book, you can't solve Halliday's puzzles without a very deep knowledge of 70s and 80s pop/nerd culture. The puzzles are all about knowing how to win a certain video game or run through a specific D&D module. Thus the fact that the characters put so much stock in having nerd cred makes sense in the books and thus doesn't come off as vapid pandering. Having nerd cred could net you in excess of half a trillion dollars and control of the Oasis. Any of you would learn the shit out of a video game if you thought it would help you earn half a trillion dollars.In the movie, the references play a much smaller (almost non-existent) role in winning Halliday's prize. With the exception of the final key, all of the challenges are focused on knowing Halliday himself - having intimate knowledge of his regrets and desires. Spielberg picked up on one small mention of Halliday having a love interest in the book and blew it up into Halliday's single most important character trait for the film. This strips many of the references of their necessary context and makes them come off as unnecessary pandering. They are cheesy. The only remotely entertaining reference involved the use of Chucky as a WMD.On the surface the book is about nostalgia; however, it's not about mindless nostalgia. One of the most brilliant things that Kline did was to turn nostalgia into a plot device through which he could explore nerd culture (both of the past and the future) and re-imagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in a new futuristic setting. He brought that morality tale - a tale of overcoming corporate greed and valuing relationships - into the 21st century using the 20th century as a plot device to develop deeper connections with his own childhood as well as with his readers.","Ready Player One",1493,3.5,2
"1494",4,"  A crossover to end all crossovers. So about 25 years into the future, being online has developed an entirely new meaning altogether. Instead of being connected to others via the internet, there is the Oasis, which takes your online presence to a whole new level. When the brainchild behind it all (Mark Rylance) passes, he posthumously releases an announcement that all of his control and stock of this giant conglomerate is up for grabs for the person who can find three Easter eggs within the Oasis. Enter our protagonist, Wade (Tye Sheridan), who has his eye on the prize. Now there has been about as much buzz as there can be surrounding the creation of this. It is based on a beloved book that fans feel very passionately about, and it features as many licensed properties that have ever been on film at the same time. Also, it is the return of the Spielberg blockbuster, and the last time he made a movie that was even a little bit like this, it went by the name Indiana Jones. If you ever saw The Adventures of Tintin, you already know that Spielberg never really lost it, and he has once again made another roller coaster ride with Ready Player One. To further enhance my experience, I got to see this in 3-D and in D-Box (I probably wouldn't have sprung for this, but I wasn't the one buying the tickets). While I will say that the 3-D in this is clear and never dark, I can still take it or leave it at the end of the day. What I did really enjoy was the immersive D-Box experience, as it made me feel like I was on a ride at Universal Studios. For a movie that sells itself on being a roller coaster ride, it really is the way to go, and you can bet money that this is how I will be enjoying the next Fast & Furious movie. Regardless, I know you don't care about that, you just want to know how the movie is. Well, I don't think I have seen a movie out there that plays on your nostalgia harder than this one does here, and that's either going to work for you or it's not. This could have very well have been named Easter Egg: The Movie, and I think it is physically impossible to catch every single nudge, wink and reference in this, or at the very least not on the first time watching it. If you're the right audience, it's going to make you geek out (there is a perfect scene at the midpoint of this that I refuse to spoil), and the only other movie that I think even attempted a crossover this ambitious was Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and even then, it wasn't to this extent. With so much of this being CGI, I was worried we were going to get something like World of Warcraft. Rest assured, it is way better than that, and this is far more accessible. I will say that I feel that whenever the story is outside of the Oasis, the characters come off as being one-dimensional and a bit flat. This just makes it so you just want to dive right back in. It doesn't hinder the story too much, but it does make it so there's not a ton of depth, and if that was there, this could have potentially became an instant classic. As it stands, it's still worth checking out big in a theater, and even though you do feel the length, it is always well-paced with tons happening any given frame so that you never get bored.","Ready Player One",1494,3.5,-0.5

"1503",3.5,"  A fast-paced action thriller with an explosion of pop-culture references and heartwarming nostalgic moments for the young and the old alike. Although the Steven Spielberg effect is no longer as vivid as in his previous works, it is an universally accepted fact that he is still kicking ass in the film industry.","Ready Player One",1503,3.5,0
"1504",4.5,"  The movie has a fantastic story and unbelievable visuals. The ride started strong and got better with each scene and each clue. This is like the National Treasure of video games. Mystery, fun, entertainment, and a great story about how games can bring people together, but its just as important to have real connections with people outside of games.","Ready Player One",1504,3.5,-1

"1506",3,"  Well it was not exactly like the book, which I will admit kind if crushed me at first. But as the film went on I took my boyfriend's advise and tried to separate the movie from the book. So after that I started to appreciate the film a little more and see the metophors of not being afraid to live your life in the real world, it kind of grew on me. But I felt movie wise, the charater development in the beginning was way to short and we didn't get enough time to get a feel for why Wade Watts is so special and deserves to win the contest. Overall, it was pretty good and I enjoyed the animation.","Ready Player One",1506,3.5,0.5

"1508",5,"  This movie was so much fun! Loved the nostalgia and all of the easter eggs that were thrown in. The cast was great, Spielberg threw in regular (recently) Mark Rylance, and somewhat up and coming's Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke (she is great). Ben Mendelsohn is always really good as a villain. And obviously the visuals and special effects looked great in this movie. It is one of the main pulls other than the nostalgia. I have no complaints regarding this movie. 5 stars from me.","Ready Player One",1508,3.5,-1.5
"1509",4,"  Books to movies will always disappoint certain viewers, so I don't even know why people who read them watch them, because they are never happy. I LOVED this! As a gamer myself, I love seeing all the games come to life, but most of all, I love the story. I think it was great! I loved this movie! I will be seeing this again!","Ready Player One",1509,3.5,-0.5
"1510",3.5,"  This feels like a fresh take on the sci-fi genre. Spielberg seems to be becoming a master of the CG world. The story line can be a little uninspiring, but what it lacks in plot it certainly makes up for with visuals. You'll need to know a few pop culture references to be full involved, but put on your VR Goggles and step into OASIS.","Ready Player One",1510,3.5,0
"1511",2,"  Book was better. This should have been adapted into a 4 part Netflix mini movie series. Keeping Spielberg at the helm with less changing the story.","Ready Player One",1511,3.5,1.5
"1512",4.5,"  I think anyone who grew up around the pop culture icons of film and the gaming industry of the 80s and early 90s should enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend seeing this film on the largest screen you can find and in 3D if that's your thing. I personally saw it the first time in Imax 3D and loved it. Definitely will see it again. Won't win any awards for plot or acting, but that's not what I was looking for at all. I wanted a shiny, action filled blast from my past and was not let down at all. I haven't read the book yet and have heard from friends that there are some changes that effect the story some.. but overall you get the general idea.Good enough acting, great visuals and soundtrack, fun. I would and have recommended this movie to friends.Remember, it's just a movie. :) Have fun!","Ready Player One",1512,3.5,-1
"1513",5,"  THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF 2018 SO FAR! THIS HAS GREAT CHARACTERS AND AMAZING VISUALS BUT THE GREATEST ASPECT IS THE POP-CULTURE REFERENCES. THE DIRECTIONS ARE TOP NOTCH AND THE ACTING IS PERFECT. THIS HILARIOUS AND ASTONISHING ADVENTURE IS ONE TO REMEMBER AND ONE TO SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN (I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SEEING IT IN THE IMAX) I WOULD GIVE THIS A VERY WELL DESERVED 100%!","Ready Player One",1513,3.5,-1.5
"1514",4,"  Based on the 2011 novel by Ernest Cline, Ready Player One marks a much-welcome return to science fiction blockbuster fare for Steven Spielberg, a genre he'd helped bring to the public consciousness over the years with movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., Jurassic Park and Minority Report. The fact that some of those works had served as inspiration for the source material only makes his choice as director here a no-brainer.The year is 2045, and our protagonist Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) lives in the slums of Columbus, Ohio, known here as the stacks for the way its various mobile homes and trailers are stacked upon one another in true shanty town manner. Everyday life in the stacks is tough, and rather than face those challenges head on, Wade takes refuge in a virtual reality world called the OASIS, where he takes the form of his avatar, Parzival. It is a world of limitless possibilities, and one with the promise of a very special reward.Following the death of its creator, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), a message is broadcast to all users of the OASIS, revealing an elaborate Easter Egg hunt. In order to complete the hunt, players must complete three tasks while gathering clues from Halliday's past, a past that is heavily steeped in a love of 80s and 90s pop culture. The first person that discovers the Easter Egg would not only inherit Halliday's riches, but also assume complete control of the OASIS itself. And thus began the hunt for the Easter Egg, a hunt that's been going on for 5 years when the movie opens.Parzival is one of the many gunters (that's short for egg hunters) looking for the egg, and he is joined on this quest by best friend, Aech (Lena Waithe), love interest, Art3mis (Oliva Cooke), and fellow gunters, Daito (Win Morisaki) and Sho (Philip Zao). They'd collective come to be known as the high five when they manage to beat the first task after Parzival cracks the clue hidden in one of Halliday's many recordings. This puts them on the radar of Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), CEO of IOI, a company that is willing to go to any lengths to gain control of the OASIS.Much like last year's Blade Runner 2049, Ready Player One is a film worth experiencing on the largest available screen. I saw it in IMAX, and looking back, I can't imagine seeing it in any other format. The film is a visual spectacle; everything from the highspeed thrills of the first task, to the breathtaking final battle that surrounded the third one manages to one-up everything that came before. Even the quieter moments of the second task remains noteworthy for its photorealistic recreation of the Overlook Hotel from the Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick horror classic, The Shining.Ready Player One isn't merely a love letter to pop culture and video game history. It is a celebration of blockbuster filmmaking. It is Steven Spielberg proving once again that he knows how to dazzle with awe-inspiring visuals and action that put the Michael Bays of this world to shame. The fact that none of that comes at the expense of a thought-provoking narrative is icing on an already-delicious cake.","Ready Player One",1514,3.5,-0.5

"1518",5,"  ""Ready Player One"" is definetly a movie that you must see on the biggest screen that you can experience. Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, and Mark Rylance gave such excellent performances. While the movie isn't character driven, but they're still likeable. Alan Silvestri has create a darn good score, as it reminded me the old days of Silvestri since he did the ""Back to the Future"" movies and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" The visuals are top notch, and it was cool seeing the Delorean and the Iron Giant to be in the movie. Steven Spielberg has done a heck of a job to adapt Ernest Cline's book into a movie, and really has made something that is pure entertainment and a world of pure imagination. See it on the biggest screen, and you'll have a wonderful time at the movies. Love this movie!","Ready Player One",1518,3.5,-1.5
"1519",2.5,"  Disappointing story. The effects and pop culture references made it worth watching but aside from that there's not much to be taken from the plot. Runtime is also too long making it hard to sit through.","Ready Player One",1519,3.5,1

"1523",5,"  Ready player One is the best action movie I have seen in Avatar . This movie filled with good writing , CGI and it got everything you need in good cinematic experience . Score is not level . If someone ask me why should I watch this movie my simple reply is , Are u fed up with this super hero and franchise driven movies where you have to wait for years for the next movie to come and never giving the best ending we want , you must go see Ready Player One its is the comprehensive movie experience that you dreamed of","Ready Player One",1523,3.5,-1.5

"1525",5,"  WOW! Orgasm after Orgasm. I wanted more so much more, give me more. Spielberg is WOW! Just I cant even describe what I felt. WOW 2nd key challenge WOW! Im ah ggr yea dont even understand what happen. WOW! AMzing... jAhahah I could not stop my smile. Definitely top 5 of my all time movies. Bravo everybody involved with this movie. Thank you for turning my week around. I went and saw this beauty twice. Thank you.","Ready Player One",1525,3.5,-1.5
"1526",4,"  READY PLAYER ONE is excessively busy and may not have made the best designs for King Kong, Mechagodzilla and various other characters but does make for a great film in telling us not to rely and depend on online video games and technology too much in foregoing real world analogous problems because that message was well delivered. When this movie began, everyone was living in a highly polluted and smog-thick planet that was environmentally ruined and their economy was dead but they turned to OASIS for comfort and taking a break from real life problems instead of actually doing something about it - thus making it so much easier for tyranny, greedy capitalist entrepreneurs and dictatorship to take over. And so in the end (right after 2 hours of pure video games turned into a movie) the main character decides to ban OASIS on Tuesdays and Thursdays not to take away our freedom, but to ensure we keep a grip on our freedom.I did not like the idea of Mechagodzilla fighting Iron Giant because there's nothing so spectacular about mixing in characters from completely different cultures. The only thing that can take down Mechagodzilla is the true Godzilla himself. Also, Mechagodzilla did not come looking out great in the movie but I'm sort of glad at least Ready Player One put Mechagodzilla back on the big screen, TOHO hasn't been using him since 2003.","Ready Player One",1526,3.5,-0.5
"1527",0.5,"  I am embarrassed for everyone involved in this train wreck.","Ready Player One",1527,3.5,3
"1528",5,"  Best movie I've seen this year so far!","Ready Player One",1528,3.5,-1.5
"1529",2,"  The movie did not make justice to the book. The story changed quite a lot, and not for the better. When I read the book, I was captivated by each character of the high five, felt sorry for Halliday, cheered for Ogden, and admired Anorak. The movie, however, shows exceptional graphics. Just because this movie had an amazing director, it does not make it GOOD. READ THE BOOK..... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. ** BOOK AND MOVIE SPOILER ALERT **Story line was terrible in the movie and lack emotion throughout. It felt fast paced. I sat through the end hoping for the last scene: when anorak transfer his powers, and Parzival uses them to kill Sorento.","Ready Player One",1529,3.5,1.5
"1530",4.5,"  Marvelous and imaginative director Steven Spielberg and Ernest Cline's story of a near future nowI creating a film full of nostalgia, 80s and what is to be one of 2018's best films","Ready Player One",1530,3.5,-1
"1531",5,"  What a movie ! Hands down amazing ! Never bored!!","Ready Player One",1531,3.5,-1.5
"1532",3.5,"  Different from the book, but doesn't detract from the book. This is an adaptation, but it mostly gets things right, especially the charm and the spirit of the quest. Worth a see in theatres, and I'm happy I shelled out the extra coin for 3D.","Ready Player One",1532,3.5,0
"1533",4,"  Given the potential storylines of the film, I understand why some people were disappointed. However, for the vision the creators had for it, I believe it was an above average execution. This film tested boundaries and took risks that I think paid off overall but will undoubtedly leave some disappointed who had a preconceived expectation. Was it perfect, no. Was it worth my time and money, 100%.","Ready Player One",1533,3.5,-0.5
"1534",2,"  All spectacle, zero heart, and unfortunately the additons and subtractions didn't quite balance each other out. Not Speilbergs best work by far. Watch it on a big screen and try not wince at the bad pacing.","Ready Player One",1534,3.5,1.5
"1535",5,"  One of my favorite movies I've seen in a very long time!","Ready Player One",1535,3.5,-1.5
"1536",2,"  Not an awful movie, but if you don't see it I don't think you're missing much. The visuals are nice, the plot is lack-luster. A lot of the depth from the book is glossed over on the movie. A lot of the themes the movie raises aren't really explored. Largely seems like a missed opportunity. If you love nostalgia and pop culture references, this may be for you. But if you don't think of the 80s as the greatest decade ever, you may just not care about this.","Ready Player One",1536,3.5,1.5
"1537",4.5,"  I am going to preface this review by saying this movie is very niche. It requires a remarkable amount of knowledge of 80s pop culture along with gaming past and present. Since I am well versed in both these areas I had a blast. Despite the movie trailing pretty far from the book it still kept the overall charm intact. The performers all played their parts perfectly and the story moved along at a very good pace. As I mentioned earlier the star of this show was the references or ""easter eggs."" If you looked away for just a second odds are you missed one. From 80s toys and music to old video games, I can't even imagine how much WB had to pay for licensing. I especially enjoyed the homage they made to The Shining. My rating could have easily been a solid 5//5, but I had to take half a star away to recognize it is not a film for everyone.","Ready Player One",1537,3.5,-1
"1538",3.5,"  Don't expect something clever, just get some popcorn and enjoy the ride.","Ready Player One",1538,3.5,0
"1539",4.5,"  The story didn't have much going for it. The whole relationship between the two main characters felt underdeveloped but this movie wins in visuals and nostalgia. One of the best looking movies I have ever seen and even if a movie is trash the visuals can bring it back for me. I will probably be seeing it again.","Ready Player One",1539,3.5,-1

"1554",2,"  So if you read the book....save that memory and DON'T ruin it with the movie. Spielberg should not have directed this..was not a good fit.

"1566",4.5,"  Just a rippin' great time at the movies. Outstanding references to 80's pop culture, honoring and celebrating American heritage ... guaranteed to drive the loony SWJ utterly bat shit crazy. Loved this movie, take that Star Wars The Last Joke.","Ready Player One",1566,3.5,-1
"1567",5,"  Great movie, loved it","Ready Player One",1567,3.5,-1.5
"1568",2.5,"  I wanted to like Ready Player One more than I did. I've owned the book for a while, but just never managed to read it - based on reviews I've read, that might be a good thing as the movie seems to let some readers down more than I was.It's hard to not be more enthused about a Spielberg movie. This just never really felt like a Speilberg movie to me. It just seemed too rushed and too flashy... don't get me wrong, Uncle Steven can - and has done flashy and movies that made you feel like you were on the edge of your seat. This just felt overdone and more concerned with sensory overload than it did anything else.Ready Player One could be a new Willie Wonka - however, rather than the lessons we learned in from Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca and the rest - we get a basic badguy with basic badguy army looking for (cyber) world domination.Ready Player One tries so hard to get us to care about this fake world by delving into the history of the its creator. Unfortunately, those are the most human moments we get out of this one. Our leading characters don't have a hint of that type of a character arc this movie needed.I am hopeful another viewing might help like this one a little more than I did. Ready Player One is still a roller coaster ride with some great moments that is a lot of fun at times and well worth watching in a theater for the shock and awe value alone.","Ready Player One",1568,3.5,1
"1569",1.5,"  If you are a fan of this book, don't see this movie. You will be HUGELY disappointed. Just go read the book again. Not sure how they took such an incredible story and turned it into this disaster, but it's tragic. The massive changes to the Aech and Art3mis characters alone are enough to skip the movie.","Ready Player One",1569,3.5,2
"1570",4,"  Overall this movie is great, it has elements from the book that makes it amazing. However there are plot holes in the movie and it moves a bit to fast. If you're looking for a book to film adaption then you will be disappointed, but if you're willing to look past the fact that it's not a book to film adaptation then over all it's a good movie.","Ready Player One",1570,3.5,-0.5
"1571",5,"  Fun movie, good for the whole family!","Ready Player One",1571,3.5,-1.5
"1572",5,"  Most of the scenes are Intense, No Drama, Super Hack-Slash. No Movies could copy this movie, also a great lesson to learn for generation these days.","Ready Player One",1572,3.5,-1.5
"1573",5,"  Saw it 30 minutes ago and would gladly turn around and see it again, loved all the references to pop culture as well as the overall plot of it, and its relate-ability","Ready Player One",1573,3.5,-1.5
"1574",5,"  Great movie! CGI was probably the greatest since Avatar. The plot is a bit repetitive, but not that bad. The message was very powerful. Nice culture references, good acting, and overall, worth seeing.","Ready Player One",1574,3.5,-1.5
"1575",5,"  An instant classic. Spielberg delivers a near perfect piece of nostalgic entertainment that is still set very much in the future.","Ready Player One",1575,3.5,-1.5
"1576",5,"  I took the kids to see the movie they absolutely loved it I have to admit I was entertained from beginning to end. A must see!","Ready Player One",1576,3.5,-1.5
"1577",4.5,"  In the lead up to the release of the film Spielberg himself wanted to stress to his audience that this was a movie, not a film. Basically meaning a spectacle film like Jurassic Park or Jaws or Indiana Jones, not like his brilliant thought pieces like Schindler's List or The Colour Purple. This is a popcorn film to sit down and be engrossed in the visuals and fun story it wants to tell. Without spoiling it I will say this film delivers.On the surface it delivers a story not all that different from young adult dystopian dramas like Hunger Games or Divergent, where it excels is its tone. Whether you are in the real world of the virtual Oasis this film never takes itself too seriously, while we care about the plight of our heroes and the stakes of what will happen if they don't succeed, everything is done with a dose of humour and levity. The film seems to work perfectly as almost a sci-fi fairytale of evil villains and mighty heroes, the Oasis is the perfect back drop for such a story.Spielberg has shown here that there is a right way to make a big budget blockbuster that is entertaining from start to finish without resorting to over the top drivel like what is so common in recent franchises like Transformers, Fast and Furious and even, I dare say, my beloved DC Comics films.Don't come into this film expecting an academy award winning think piece, come in looking to be entertained and enthralled, you will not be disappointed.","Ready Player One",1577,3.5,-1
"1578",4.5,"  Even though Black Panther was incredible, Ready Player One is excitement I really want to revisit. One of Spielberg's best films since the 90s.","Ready Player One",1578,3.5,-1
"1579",5,"  Out of this world cool. Amazing action scenes.","Ready Player One",1579,3.5,-1.5
"1580",5,"  Great movie for the family and anyone that loves video games","Ready Player One",1580,3.5,-1.5
"1581",4,"  It's a great movie, gives me a lot of that 70's 80's adventure or quest vibe from older movies. While it has a 'Willy Wonka' flavor, it's easily more than ""Willy Wonka but with video games'. The references are amusing but tend to not be the crux of the movie, so if you don't get a reference the movie doesn't leave you out to dry.That's the thing, if the movie had 'no' references, it would still be a great movie, but the other stuff just made it seem more connected to our world. It's not perfect, the story itself is thin but more in the way that it's simplistic and easy to follow.It's a great movie that I think will age like Rodger Rabbit, it can hold up on its own even when more and more people are too young to get it's references.","Ready Player One",1581,3.5,-0.5
"1582",5,"  Briliant movie, just go to the cinemas and enjoy for yourself. As less you know about the movie, the better you enjoy. Stop reading Reviews and be part of the incredible world that Spielberg, Cline and Penn created.","Ready Player One",1582,3.5,-1.5
"1583",1,"  What did they do to Artemis? This was horrible. They ruined it. The guy next to me kept groaning and putting his head in his hands. I watched the entire thing only because I paid a fortune for an imax 3d movie.. would it have killed them to have a fat actress? And why was H given so little screen time in the real world? Artemis is a smaller character then H. They should have left out the resistance, there were so many amazing things in the book and they needed to make things up. This is barely better than the Eragon debacle. READ THE BOOK, SKIP THE MOVIE.","Ready Player One",1583,3.5,2.5
"1584",4.5,"  My only question as of just getting home from the theater, how did they afford all the licences for the Easter Eggs? There are at least 100 different specifically named/pictured other IP's in this movie lolMy only complaint is the love story between Wade and Samantha seems a tad forced. (Plus lets be honest its a trope as old as writing itself.Gotta subvert tropes like that, turn them on their heads some how.)","Ready Player One",1584,3.5,-1
"1585",5,"  really a good movie ever","Ready Player One",1585,3.5,-1.5
"1586",1,"  Why..... why did you do this to me Steven? Ernest Kline wrote a killer a story and I fell in love with it. You came in and ripped it all to shreds, said sorry and tried to tape it back together with shitty scotch tape, but forgot how the original was put together so you decided to add and remove key parts of the original. I feel dead inside.","Ready Player One",1586,3.5,2.5
"1587",4.5,"  Entertaining from start to finish, no real parts of the movie where I felt disengaged. Sure the story is a little cheesy but hey it was fun.","Ready Player One",1587,3.5,-1
"1588",4.5,NA,"Ready Player One",1588,3.5,-1
"1589",1.5,"  As a stand alone film it's fine but as a fan of the book this film fell painfully short, the basic theme remained but it failed to utilize any of story elements, opting instead to replace the real story with flashy filler","Ready Player One",1589,3.5,2
"1590",5,"  best movie i ever seen so far","Ready Player One",1590,3.5,-1.5

"1593",0.5,"  I wish I could rate lower. This movie relies on the quality of better cultural pieces before it, while adding nothing. The characters were empty, the animation was uninspired, and the concept of an world where anything goes is not new, and this movie doesn't do anything new with the concept.","Ready Player One",1593,3.5,3
"1594",2,"  This movie was better than the atrocious book. If you love high school, acne and teenage angst, this movie and book are for you.Speilberg was asleep at the wheel here, focused on technical mastery without any heart whatsoever. We don't care about any of the characters, and find their struggles to be just a giant boring cartoon.Save your money, ignore this movie and the book, too.","Ready Player One",1594,3.5,1.5
"1595",5,"  Amazing, I love the movie.","Ready Player One",1595,3.5,-1.5
"1596",5,"  Spielberg does it again! I would say, though, that if you are over the age of about 40, you may not enjoy it. But that's only if you don't like insanely good CGI and tons of action. Although it has a somewhat sexual part and has some language, I would still say it's a movie that most of that family could enjoy.","Ready Player One",1596,3.5,-1.5
"1597",4.5,"  Exelent movie, brutal effects///spanish: Excelente es muy buena película totalmente recomendable y no solo para milenials por que también aparecen referencias de lo 80 y 90, ademas de los juegos, consolas y tendencias de ahora","Ready Player One",1597,3.5,-1
"1598",3,"  To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Ready Player One. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of video games most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Parzival's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from the video game series Final Fantasy, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Ready Player One truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Parzival's existencial catchphrase ""You're full of shit"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Activision's video game epic Call Of Duty. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Steven Spielberg's genius unfolds itself on their theater screens. What fools... how I pity them. ?? And yes by the way, I DO have a Ready Player One tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.","Ready Player One",1598,3.5,0.5
"1599",2.5,"  I was really looking forward to this movie and knew that they wouldn't be able to get everything that was in the book. I was amazed though that they completely changed the storyline from the book. The main idea is the same, but none of the challenges and much of the plot line are different. It might as well have been based on a different book, in my opinion. Overall the movie is entertaining, but I left extremely disappointed and thought they really missed the mark on this one.","Ready Player One",1599,3.5,1
"1600",5,"  I grew up on games. Video games shaped my childhood. This movie? Brings back all the old and all the new with everything from old arcade games to Overwatch. The reality in this movie is every baker's wet dream. Perfectly tied with nerdiness and nostalgia and the rush of adventure in exploring a new game... best movie I've seen in years.","Ready Player One",1600,3.5,-1.5
"1601",5,"  Nostalgia at every turn, great visuals, gripping story, great movie!","Ready Player One",1601,3.5,-1.5
"1602",4,"  Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan) who lives in the year 2045 spends most of his time in virtual reality in a world called the OASIS. The creator of the OASIS, James Haliday, leaves an Easter Egg (which we learn about after he dies) for one of his players to find where the prize is his fortune and complete control of this wonderful virtual place. Wade and his friends, known as the High Five, take on the adventure to find the special prize but they are pursued and targeted by many enemies.I gave this movie 4 stars, I really enjoyed it. I thought it showed the audience two completely different worlds that were both equally well done yet it still felt like one movie. Nothing felt disconnected between real world and virtual and things flowed very nicely.In the virtual world, it was great that the story showed how anonymous we can be in that environment. It doesn't matter how you were raised, where you live, how you look or what you are interested in. Wade and all the characters in the High Five are great examples of normal kids, even from poor backgrounds that had great followings and great experiences in the OASIS.Lots of unexpected things happen in this movie. A few parts were not appropriate for very young kids but being 16 and seeing it with my mom and other adults I would say this would make a great movie to see with the family. It's quite an adventure.","Ready Player One",1602,3.5,-0.5
"1603",5,"  i don't know most of the references in this movie, but it was very entertaining and a whole lot of fun. There were moments that completely wowed me, i did not expect anything. Thanks for a good time!","Ready Player One",1603,3.5,-1.5
"1604",5,"  This was the movie that my childhood was waiting for.","Ready Player One",1604,3.5,-1.5
"1605",4,"  This was actually pretty good!!!!","Ready Player One",1605,3.5,-0.5
"1606",3,"  I would of given this 4 stars, but it had to loose a star because the movie pretty much cut-out everything that made the book so unique (80s pop culture). Instead it tries to make 20 somethings interested in seeing movie by throwing in 90s and 00s pop crap (halo and iron giant), so now it's just a vanilla sci-fi flick. Still a fun, well acted, directed, popcorn flick, but without the central plot of the book, it's forgettable.","Ready Player One",1606,3.5,0.5
"1607",2.5,"  Not as bad a re-write as the Dark Tower, but close.","Ready Player One",1607,3.5,1
"1608",3,"  Whilst is follows the typical 'heroes journey' formula to the letter in three acts, this was a great film to go see with the kids. The adults spend all their time looking at the multitude of pop culture references, where there are ones the kids can pick up on too, they will mostly watch the story. A good examination of how people are rapidly escaping reality in the virtual world that we have created, and it also sent a strong warning to kids about giving away clues to your real identity online, ands the consequences of this. It had the usual messages about corporatisation of the virtual world, and keeping it free for the people. I liked it as I think all these messages are important, and it was pure escapism for the duration of the film, even though it was simplistic. Worth a watch","Ready Player One",1608,3.5,0.5
"1609",5,"  interesante, son demasiados cambios con respecto al libro pero se respeta la esencia del mismo.","Ready Player One",1609,3.5,-1.5
"1610",4,"  I came in with low expectations, but Ready Player One was consistently entertaining from beginning to end. Too much exposition and forced character dialogue hold a fun and competently-made film back from being truly great.","Ready Player One",1610,3.5,-0.5
"1611",5,"  Very surprised with this film! I?m into pop culture and gaming so this was a no brainer for me, but I also brought my girlfriend along who really isn?t into that stuff. I could almost say she liked it more than I did. I would highly recommend watching this movie.","Ready Player One",1611,3.5,-1.5
"1612",5,"  this movie is amazing if you are a super 80s nerd like me go see this movie","Ready Player One",1612,3.5,-1.5
"1613",5,"  Damn right five stars. Steven Spielberg did it again. He created so many iconic films that are now classic Jaws, ET, Jurassic Park, Schindler's list and man many more (no these are not all Spielberg's films I know) but with this one he added another iconic film to his resume .... great greaaaaat fun.","Ready Player One",1613,3.5,-1.5
"1614",5,"  If you grew up in the '80s and were technically-oriented and/or played AD&D or other games, this is the movie for you.","Ready Player One",1614,3.5,-1.5
"1615",5,"  Loved it! So fun! I read the book a few years ago and it's still my favorite. I thought the differences between the book & the movie were cool. To me, it added more to the story- like having alternate endings. I'll be watching this again & again!","Ready Player One",1615,3.5,-1.5
"1616",3.5,"  3.5/5JAMES CAMERON: ... Hold my beer.","Ready Player One",1616,3.5,0
"1617",5,"  Absolutely fabulous ! One of the most clever - well organized - fast moving films I've seen in a while - You MUST see this in 3D !!! Technically amazing - from start to finish - the special effects were unbelievable... the characters were extremely well developed- lots of plot twists and turns - Very uplifting - inspiring- and humorous - Loved it enough to go back and see it again !! Certain portions reminded me slightly of Avatar ... but faster paced Highly recommend!!","Ready Player One",1617,3.5,-1.5
"1618",5,"  Incredible spectacle! There are scenes in the first half that took my breath away. The soundtrack to this film was written by Back to the Future composer Alan Silvestri and it's fantastic. Loved it ?? ?? ?? ?? ??","Ready Player One",1618,3.5,-1.5

"1621",5,"  2000 times better than Last Jedi Garbage","Ready Player One",1621,3.5,-1.5
"1622",5,"  ""Ready Player One"" is a good time at the movies. The story has familiarities with any classic adventure movie, so no real surprises.The movie will have less of an impact for people not deeply moved or deeply affected by film/game culture although they should be entertained by the sheer awesomeness of the visuals, the tie-in of the video-game world with the real world, and for the reflection of today's technology (and tomorrow's aspiring technology) in entertainment/life. I recommend this movie because it's the Spielberg magical experience with his quality story-telling using the source material of our modern world and potential future!","Ready Player One",1622,3.5,-1.5
"1623",2.5,"  Besides all huge special effects, this movie was awful! The characters are flat and two dimensional, that once you get pass all the 80s 90s references you are left with plotline that has one key ingredient missing - a soul. Which I guess is the point of the movie, which is for humanity to give up on planet earth and submit to living life in a cheap mindless version of it through VR.","Ready Player One",1623,3.5,1
"1624",2.5,"  Continuing an unfortunate tradition that has come to characterize many of his recent films, director Steven Spielberg's latest big-budget bloated extravaganza dazzles visually but grows tiresome (some might even say exasperating) rather quickly. The picture plays like a glitzy, nostalgic stroll down an '80s version of memory lane, chock full of nonstop references to the decade's movies. music and memes (in itself an odd fascination for characters in a story set in 2045). What's worse, the film lacks a fundamentally compelling story and takes about 45 minutes too long to get to a central message that becomes patently obvious early on in the picture. If you're looking for purely mindless entertainment, you'll probably find this moderately amusing, but, if you want something more substantive, skip this one and watch one of the filmmaker's earlier (and much better) offerings.","Ready Player One",1624,3.5,1
"1625",4,"  Honest entertainment that doesnt seem to care delivering more than the throwback euphoria for all millenial movie fans and it doesnt have to. SS is better at doing this kind of stuff. Would watch again.","Ready Player One",1625,3.5,-0.5
"1626",5,"  Wow this movie was awesome. I was geeking out through the whole thing. All the Easter eggs, the graphics, the story. 10/10. The ultimate movie for gamers!","Ready Player One",1626,3.5,-1.5
"1627",5,"  One of the best book to movie adaptations I've ever seen!","Ready Player One",1627,3.5,-1.5
"1628",4.5,"  Fantastic! The book is one of my favorites of all time and even though they had some significant departures I thought it was all done in the spirit of Cline's vision. The CGI was unbelievable and the acting was superb. Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn were great, also strong performances from Sheridan and Waithe.","Ready Player One",1628,3.5,-1
"1629",5,"  While a good bit different than the book, it captures the essence very well none the less. Spielberg adjustments probably made it a better movie","Ready Player One",1629,3.5,-1.5
"1630",5,"  My advice to one and all is see the movie, then read or listen to the book. The movie was/is great but if you have read the book first and are dissapointed understand they did the best they could. However if you have NOT read the book WAIT see the movie and than read or listen to the book and it will be so much better for you.","Ready Player One",1630,3.5,-1.5
"1631",3,"  Having read the book I was looking very much forward to seeing the movie . The movie stands on its own. It really is not the story we all read in the book. There were some nostalgic references and music but nothing to the extent of what it should or could have been. The storyline was very much diluted and most of what I liked about the book was lost. If you haven't read the book and especially if you are a gamer you probably wiill enjoy it. If you're looking for a nostalgic walk back to the 80s you experienced in the book you will be quick disappointed. So, if you go see this movie try not to have any preconceptions. It is a work on it's own and a minor tribute to thr text it originated from.","Ready Player One",1631,3.5,0.5
"1632",5,"  Absolutely fantastic movie which is riddled with video game references. An instant classic and new personal favorite","Ready Player One",1632,3.5,-1.5
"1633",4.5,"  Loved the movie. My only real complaint was a weak/wooden villain but I still immediately wanted to watch the movie again right after finishing it","Ready Player One",1633,3.5,-1

"1637",0.5,"  If I could give 0 stars I would. Literally, horrible. Not only did it take away everything that made the book good and interesting, it turned it into the most cliche, stupid story with stereotypical villians and heroes. Wish I could get my money back, it was SO horrible.","Ready Player One",1637,3.5,3
"1638",5,"  Nothing less than EPIC!","Ready Player One",1638,3.5,-1.5
"1639",5,"  A classic Steven Spielberg masterpiece. Absolutely stellar!","Ready Player One",1639,3.5,-1.5

"1641",3.5,"  Really didn?t connect with this for the first 20 or 30 mins then classic Spielberg kicked in - nostalgia, romance, kids against authority - and I got swept up a number of times - ending very weak - and Simon Pegg - no - but go see especially if the 80s and 90s or video games are your thing.","Ready Player One",1641,3.5,0
"1642",3.5,"  Entertaining, good message... a fun movie.","Ready Player One",1642,3.5,0
"1643",3,"  I enjoyed elements of the movie, but it was hard to feel that the characters were at any risk because they were in a video game. Also, I'm not an advocate of anyone spending so much time playing these games.","Ready Player One",1643,3.5,0.5
"1644",3.5,"  Pretty good. The villain was kind of predicable and childish.","Ready Player One",1644,3.5,0

"1650",5,"  Not one boring moment. Lots of action and excitement. Loved every moment of it.","Ready Player One",1650,3.5,-1.5
"1651",4.5,"  Fantastic visuals and great nostalgia. Well worth seeing on the big screen to get fully immersed in the experience.","Ready Player One",1651,3.5,-1
"1652",5,"  Amazing it was produced very well. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was super amazing!","Ready Player One",1652,3.5,-1.5
"1653",0.5,"  I loved this book so much I read it 3 times. It is one of the best sci fi books to come out in years. The story is fresh, the characters are complex and 3 dimensional. This stakes are high in a life and death struggle against amazing odds with a faceless corporation bent on dominating the world. It's all set in a dystopian future with tons of 80's nostalgia. The movie has NONE OF IT!!! This is the worst adaptation I have ever seen! Until this point, M. Night Shyamalan's adaptation of ""The Last Airbender"" held that honor. Nearly every aspect of what made this book special is gone. All of the tasks to get Halliday's ""Egg"" have been completely changed. There are not even ""Gates"" to pass. Just collect the Keys. And if you loved the strong female lead of Artemis, Be prepared for a gut punch as she is put into a submissive roll where she literally says to Wade, "" you are more important than me."" Spielberg has lost his touch. If you've read the book, for God's sake do not see this movie. If you have not read the book, do so and skip this P.O.S.","Ready Player One",1653,3.5,3
"1654",4,"  Behind all of the pop culture, references and flashy graphics, behind the intense action and humorous lines, this is a film about rediscovering reality. About realizing that, outside of the screen, outside of your room, there is a real world with real people. for more: https://latetothegame.blog/2018/04/01/new-movie-review-ready-player-one-2018/","Ready Player One",1654,3.5,-0.5
"1655",4.5,"  This movie was made for nerds like me who grew up on pop culture from the 80s and 90s. It's very Spielberg, but in this case, it works!","Ready Player One",1655,3.5,-1
"1656",4,"  Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Ernest Cline popular nerd-novel is a visual blast, filled with eye-candy imagery and an amazingly number of pop-culture references, not to mention the dazzling and breath taking action sequences that reminds us to the director's classic film-making style in his early days, all in favor for a perfectly harmless action flick, even though its characters lack the strength to live up to the story, but still a fine welcome to the director's classic sci-fi roots.","Ready Player One",1656,3.5,-0.5
"1657",5,"  Perfectly nostalgic. The book is still far superior but they did a good job of making the movie light and fun.","Ready Player One",1657,3.5,-1.5
"1658",5,"  It's a great and very funny movie. loved it","Ready Player One",1658,3.5,-1.5
"1659",2.5,"  It's not without some breathtaking sequences but I think the whole thing plays it a little too safe for my taste. More impressive than the Oasis is the dystopian reality of the film where humans have essentially given up on real life and corporations buy people's debt to create a slave work force but it's just not given the focus it deserves.","Ready Player One",1659,3.5,1
"1660",3,"  All action and special effects (which are very good) tied to a weak plot.","Ready Player One",1660,3.5,0.5
"1661",5,"  This is the very first time I have ever left a review for any movie. This isnt some simple action flick that I was lead to believe. Yes there is a plethora of cultural references, but it is what isnt obvious that sets this movie apart from similar films.When i was a kid I was always told friends I make on video games arent ""real"". This movie dives right into this premise and tears it apart. Wade Watts the protagonist develops close bonds with his fellow gamers. Outside of this immersive game they band together to save the one thing that brought them all together. This film shows that no matter where in life we are or what may come true friendships can be found in even the most ridiculous of places.","Ready Player One",1661,3.5,-1.5
"1662",4.5,"  The funnest time I have had at the movies in a long time. Vintage Spielberg.Loved it!","Ready Player One",1662,3.5,-1
"1663",5,"  Really fun, great portrayal of the book. Full of Easter Eggs. WIsh it would have had Leopardon, but what are you going to do.","Ready Player One",1663,3.5,-1.5
"1664",5,"  Instant classic! One of the rare ""I will go see this in theatres again"" films.","Ready Player One",1664,3.5,-1.5
"1665",3.5,"  It was good movie, very entertaining. However, beware, it doesn't really follow the book. Don't read further if you don't want some spoilers. It's in the spirit of the book, but most the references are changed. They made up different quests and they are much shorter than the book. One big change is there is no Oasis school. Lots of the chafracters in the game are made to appeal to younger kids and more from current video games than the classic 80's from the book. Music was 80s, but I was very disappointed it didn't open with Oingo Boingo and there was no Oingo Boingo in the movie at all. (Halliday's favorite band) , I was looking froward to that:( It was a good movie, but I knew they missed the mark when they missed the golden opportunity to put the Clock work Orange reference Easter egg from the book in the movie.","Ready Player One",1665,3.5,0
"1666",5,"  What a great book to movie adaptation. Usually they mes these up, not this time :)","Ready Player One",1666,3.5,-1.5
"1667",5,"  Best movie of the year. Loved it will watch it again later as so many hidden characters in it. Go watch it for sure.","Ready Player One",1667,3.5,-1.5
"1668",3,"  Decent film, better for its cg but so so on story playing on nostalgia in parts and trying to get the 'chocolate factory'. Good at matinee prices and good enough for 3D.","Ready Player One",1668,3.5,0.5
"1669",4,"  Didn't read the book so I guess I can't do the tiresome 'the book is better than the movie' comparison... that being said... I thoroughly enjoyed this pop culture nerdy nostalgia adventure.","Ready Player One",1669,3.5,-0.5
"1670",0.5,"  Absolutely horrible. Bad acting, bad script, and a pointless plot with no stakes. It is just a constant stream of 80s references with no substance.","Ready Player One",1670,3.5,3
"1671",4.5,"  A rip-roaring virtual adventure through time (forward into Virtual Reality whose entire premise relies on looking BACKWARD to pop-culture of the 80's. If you go to the movies to have a good time, see your kids smile and maybe stifle a nostalgic sniffle or two at your own distant past...then Ready Player One is for you.","Ready Player One",1671,3.5,-1
"1672",4,"  Obviamente muchas diferencias con el libro , retos y segmentos anulados o cambiados , el tema de licencias obvio impacta en la trama , pero aun asi la premisa y la batalla final se respetaron lo mas que se pudieron con los elementos disponibles y negociados , como siempre meter un libro en una pelicula de dos horas es un reto , y este lo fue mas por lo mencionado, Para palomear , pero si vas como purista del libro mejor ni vayas,","Ready Player One",1672,3.5,-0.5
"1673",4.5,"  Meca Godzilla VS Gundam from Hollywood movie I never imagined.","Ready Player One",1673,3.5,-1
"1674",5,"  As an avid gamer I can honestly say this movie was awesome. Had a blast watching it, main character didn't seem like a fake nerd and geeked out at times like any of us would have in the same situation.","Ready Player One",1674,3.5,-1.5
"1675",1.5,"  A generic Young Adult film full of plot holes and moments that break your suspension of disbelief.","Ready Player One",1675,3.5,2
"1676",3.5,"  I'm a huge fan of the book, which is part of my problem with this movie.","Ready Player One",1676,3.5,0
"1677",5,"  immensely nostalgicand had a sense of adventure that90s, gamers who grew up looking for secret mario levels, zelda upgrades and meticulous cartridge saves; would surely appreciate.","Ready Player One",1677,3.5,-1.5
"1678",2.5,"  Pretty bad. Took the book and rewrote everything except like 2 things","Ready Player One",1678,3.5,1
"1679",1,"  He did a great job at taking a wonderful book and mutilating it. South Park was right, Spieldberg is an ass.","Ready Player One",1679,3.5,2.5
"1680",5,"  This film was an excellent and ambitious viewing experience. The film was one of the most entertaining films ever put to screen. There is almost no downtime if any in the entire movie. While it does not deliver the same depth as the masterpiece that is the book, the film is thoroughly satisfying .","Ready Player One",1680,3.5,-1.5
"1681",3,"  Aside from the many Easter eggs, overall a bit boring and uninspiring, especially the real-world parts, which are very pantomime-ish; the only excitement is provided in the VR action sequences. Def one for kids with a bit of nostalgia thrown in so the parents won't be too bored.","Ready Player One",1681,3.5,0.5
"1682",4,"  In a way reminded me of the movie ""War Games"" and Professor Hawkins - but I really liked this movie. Great effects and a very reasonable integration between real and virtual worlds. Great character development. Good casting ... main roles were a good match and actors ... passable villain however. go an enjoy","Ready Player One",1682,3.5,-0.5
"1683",4,"  B+, solid and fun movie with a good story. The hero development was good. The virtual falling in love was a stretch and there wasn't much there. The Villan was the usually greedy, out of touch, corporate guy and that's the only thing I didn't care for in the movie. It's a good watch, nonetheless.","Ready Player One",1683,3.5,-0.5
"1684",2,"  This is one of 2 movies I was really looking forward to seeing this year, and I'm sad to say that it was a huge letdown. The pacing was off, the story was choppy and the writing was barely decent. The plot was cringeworthy more times than not and completely forgettable. It was like Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory except without any heart or moral to the story.To say I'm disappointed is an understatement-and here I thought 'The Last Jedi' was mediocre. Go see this movie if you're dying to see just how many pop culture references you'll get. Stay away if you were hoping for a remotely engaging dystopian adventure.","Ready Player One",1684,3.5,1.5
"1685",3,"  Best popcorn movie I've seen in a while! It was a few minor flaws. There are a couple of edits that feel like last minute cuts, and those are jarring and took me out of the story for a a beat, but it quickly pulled me back in. It's full of heart, and I enjoyed it much better that the book!","Ready Player One",1685,3.5,0.5
"1686",5,"  This movie is fantastic! Sure some nostalgia elements were cool, but removing the glimpse of He-Man and some others, it is just really well made. The action is great and the story pulled me in completely. The CGI is extremely good too. I have nothing but praise! I'll be a repeat viewer with some other friends too.","Ready Player One",1686,3.5,-1.5
"1687",3,"  There's a large amount of excitement to be had here, massive action scenes and gorgeous scenery to behold; it's just purely up to the viewer whether it's worth trudging through a dreadful script and climax after climax of an overstuffed runtime.","Ready Player One",1687,3.5,0.5
"1688",5,"  Some movies are meals, some are vegetables, and some are dessert. This movie is a great dessert movie, which is exactly what is sets out to be.","Ready Player One",1688,3.5,-1.5
"1689",3.5,"  Very entertaining although it took a different path than the book does; but overall great film.","Ready Player One",1689,3.5,0
"1690",4.5,"  For those that need the story to follow faithfully to the novel, move on. Visuals and storyline were fantastic and the changes make other characters a bit more full but H's story becomes weaker, which is too bad. My other beef is with the glaring omission of Rush in the soundtrack.","Ready Player One",1690,3.5,-1
"1691",3.5,"  Great SFX & visuals. Cheesy in parts, but I loved all the pop culture references & there are A LOT of them!Enjoyable overall. [7/10]","Ready Player One",1691,3.5,0
"1692",4.5,"  Halfway through the movie - It's a passable movie actually. It brings back the magic of those simplistic 80's Spielberg movies.. The easter eggs are alright bu - HOLY MOTHER OF POP-CULTURE IS THAT A A GUNDAM?? DID HE SAY "" I . AM. GUNDAM.""Cheers with crowd . Satisfied 100%.","Ready Player One",1692,3.5,-1
"1693",3.5,"  filled with easter eggs and references, ready player one is a success","Ready Player One",1693,3.5,0
"1694",3,"  overhyped, overrated.entertaining but nothing special or memorable.it throws every pop culture easter egg it can at you during its running time, however entertaining, it doesn't make for a good movie.","Ready Player One",1694,3.5,0.5
"1695",5,"  This movie is awesome. Mind blowing in every way. Visually and narratively stunning. Not only does it show a plethora of 80s pop culture, it also sends a human message of what is going on in the todays world technology. Another Steven Spielberg classic that is relatable to every age. A movie for people who enjoy and geek out on movies and video games from the past and now. And as well for people who have not been interested, but are looking for a way to understand that world of geeksters.","Ready Player One",1695,3.5,-1.5
"1696",1,"  Movie did not have the 'wow factor'. Middle part of the movie was so boring that I took a nap during it. Watch Tomb Raider or Pacific Rim instead.","Ready Player One",1696,3.5,2.5
"1697",2,"  Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: for all its flaws, I loved the book. I went into the movie fully prepared for major changes; 75% of the book would not translate well on to the screen. The book was for people like me. The nerds, the people who are unapologetic about their adoration for things. The movie was not for nerds.All I've seen are reviews about ""too much nostalgia,"" but honestly? There wasn't enough. The characters' obsession with all things 80s wasn't in the movie and it really wasn't integral to the plot anyway. It didn't do anything for them, except a bit in the final challenge. That nerd-normalization that felt so good in the books just wasn't there. This wasn't a movie for me and I'm okay with that. It was a big blockbuster with a lot of references to pop culture.It was a bit boring truthfully; a lot of splash with no real plot and one dimensional characters. T.J. Miller's I-R0k was a highlight, which is actually a pretty sad commentary. Ben Mendelsohn' s live action scenes clearly show he's better than his character's over-the-top villainy. And if I never have to sit through a wooden Tye Sheridan performance again I'll be very happy.","Ready Player One",1697,3.5,1.5
"1698",1,"  Another review said ""a mile wide and a pixel deep"" which is spot on. They butchered the book's storyline (or disregarded it totally) and failed to capture any of the compelling aspects which the books storyline produced. Even if you haven't read the book, the storytelling and acting is laughable. Was real hyped to see this, and with a little imagination could have done a lot with this plot line. Spielberg took the easy path, tried to appeal to a wider audience, and fell way short. Even the CGI and action scenes were aggressively mediocre.","Ready Player One",1698,3.5,2.5
"1699",5,"  Honestly one of my new favorite movies! (I'm a gamer and I really related to the protagonists)","Ready Player One",1699,3.5,-1.5
"1700",0.5,"  This movie, while visually stunning.. was terrible. The book and this share one thing in common...a name, and that's it. Which they chose to not even explain.","Ready Player One",1700,3.5,3
"1701",4,"  They couldn't stick to the book exactly... because that'd be boring. So, what they did was great.","Ready Player One",1701,3.5,-0.5
"1702",5,"  Steven Spielberg's best movie since Jurassic Park and the most visually dazzling movie since Avatar.","Ready Player One",1702,3.5,-1.5
"1703",5,"  Best movie for 90's kids, spree-video gaming","Ready Player One",1703,3.5,-1.5
"1704",4.5,"  Exactly what a movie should be. I was concerned it would all be CGI stunts and over-the-top excitement. But between the nostalgic nods to the past and the gooney-like feel of comradery of the live action scenes, the VR portion of the movie fit in perfectly.","Ready Player One",1704,3.5,-1
"1705",1.5,"  A book that was loved by Millions destroyed by a director who is loved by Millions. Spielberg has used this move to gratify himself, it is as if Spielberg sees himself in the role of Halliday in the movie and has created a movie based on his own obsessions. Those who have never read the book may well fall in love with it but for those who have read the book it is a pale shadow of the original novel. If this movie was to be another Soielberg movie it would be as if he had rebooted Raiders of the Lost Ark by giving us Indy 4","Ready Player One",1705,3.5,2
"1706",0.5,"  This reminds me of E.T., you have a bunch of people saying it's the best movie ever, but all I see is a boring, senseless bad collection of incoherent scenes. No sense, no story, awful cast. Wasted Hannah John-Kamen horribly, when she is clearly lead role material. You have to know you're off when your lead is the star of boy scouts vs zombies. Plain garbage.","Ready Player One",1706,3.5,3
"1707",5,"  It's a great movie with great plot points. If i had the budget for it I would see it again 20 times!","Ready Player One",1707,3.5,-1.5
"1708",3.5,"  I read the book a number of years ago and I absolutely loved the book!! IT brought back so many memories of things from my childhood and brought them into the future. I was excited when I heard that they made a movie and could not wait to go see it. While the movie was good it was nothing like the book that I loved, which left me disappointed. If I had not read the book first and created images in my head of what the oasis looked like and the characters looked like it may have been better. They also did not follow the plot line very well, which I can understand as the movie was already long. However, they left out some pretty important pieces that I was waiting to see. So while good it did not live up to my expectations of what it could have been.","Ready Player One",1708,3.5,0
"1709",5,"  So cool! So fresh! Finally a true Spielberg, I've been waiting for this movie since Jurassic Park.","Ready Player One",1709,3.5,-1.5
"1710",4,"  A visual spectacle filled with gamer references everywhere. Being a child of the70s and 80s that has played games all my life this movie was made for me. There are some slow parts of the movie, but overall it is fun watch and it looked incredible on the big screen. See it in the theater for full effect.","Ready Player One",1710,3.5,-0.5
"1711",4,"  With loads of easter eggs pouring out from the movie. The feeling of adventure and nostalgia is all over Ready Player One movie.","Ready Player One",1711,3.5,-0.5
"1712",4,"  Great fun. Great way to spend a rainy afternoon. I have a feeling Spielberg has been wanting to make this for a long time. Just for the fun of it. The characters are great. The avatars are fun The oasis is fun. With the look of the real world is believable and it's no wonder ever one wants to live in the oasis. I want to see it again just to catch all the eggs I missed the first time.","Ready Player One",1712,3.5,-0.5
"1713",2,"  I just didn't like it, cheesy, boring and over the top. however, the acting was great and the visual effects were amazing.","Ready Player One",1713,3.5,1.5
"1714",4,"  As a fan of 80s pop culture, this movie give me a lot of touching. The story is just fine and many places don't make sense. But it reminds me that 80s is a awesome period. There are lots of changing compare with the novel and I think it's acceptable. It is a good pop-corn movie.PS: I laughed so hard with the shinning scene.","Ready Player One",1714,3.5,-0.5
"1715",4.5,"  Must watch!!! Awesome as bass k to the future!","Ready Player One",1715,3.5,-1
"1716",5,"  I absolutely loved this movie and the book and hope to see more soon!","Ready Player One",1716,3.5,-1.5
"1717",5,"  Great movie! I highly recommend seeing. You feel immersed in the movie the whole time and has a great plot. Saw it in 3D IMAX with my husband and we can't stop talking about it!","Ready Player One",1717,3.5,-1.5
"1718",4.5,"  What a blast! Ready Player One is so much fun! I had a huge smile on my face the entire way through. It's not particularly deep, but who cares? This movie is classic Spielberg. Classic Spielberg has never needed to be deep to be good. Indiana Jones anyone? Ready Player One is fast, fun, exciting, visually stunning (seriously), surprisingly funny, and stock full of endearing characters. My only real complaint with the movie is that sometimes it can be a bit too cheesy, but it's Spielberg cheese, so my appetite for it kind of increases weirdly enough. From what reviews I've seen, most other people's biggest complaint is that the movie is too reliant on cultural references. I do agree that sometimes the references can be a bit overbearing, but that's kind of the point of the movie, so I give it a pass. For the most part, I think the references within the story work perfectly. In truth, Ready Player One is a completely original story filled with completely unoriginal cultural artifacts, and that makes it one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. For people who aren't fans of the cultural cramming, I would honestly say that the movie makes a big improvement over the book. In the book, the easter egg hunt is more about memorization of random pop-culture knowledge. Whereas in the book, the hunt involves pop-culture but is more about understanding the creator of the virtual world and learning a lesson about him and yourself. That's a big distinction between the two entities, and it makes the game of spot the reference in the movie more bearable and more fun. At the end of the virtual day, it seems that Ready Player One is a movie that was tailor-made for me. Maybe I'm just partial to a kicking' 80s soundtrack, but I have a sneaking suspicion Ready Player One is more than that.","Ready Player One",1718,3.5,-1
"1719",4.5,"  REALLY fun. Good escapist sci fy goodness. :) Was missing a few things I was looking forward to from the book; but it captured the spirit very well. It left out the bleakest part of the books; which since its PG-13 I can understand. But was an unapologetic homage to so many Speilberg references. If you were ever a bit of a nerd in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, or current; this is your bag.","Ready Player One",1719,3.5,-1
"1720",4.5,"  Little Andy Samberg battles for the 80's. There is so much to see. Pretty sure I saw a Battletoad.So much fun.","Ready Player One",1720,3.5,-1
"1721",3.5,"  This is one of those ""what you see is what you get"" kind of deals. It's marketed as this huge 80s throw back but it never feels out of place because of the world this movie exists in. It actually feels more like a World of Warcraft type of deal with this huge MMO taking up a majority of the time. But, the movie never strays too much from the safe route and even gets a little creepy with this whole Shining segment. I had fun while watching it but ultimately I left the theater with a feeling of mild satisfaction. Probably because the final showdown could have gone with the epic bass tones of Tom Sawyer but decided to go with We're Not Gonna Take it which was pretty cheesy in my oppinion. I feel like Avatar pulled off the whole balance between the Avatar world and the real world better and there are better ways of giving you that warm 80s nostalgia feeling than just ""oh hey millenium falcon, breakfast club, back to the future. Remember those things?""","Ready Player One",1721,3.5,0
"1722",3,"  Nostalgia filed Spielberg film that definitely had a lot of pop culture references from my youth that i enjoyed.. way too much to see on first viewing in face. The characters were appealing also and had an old timey movie feel to much of the interactions... with new fangled vfx thrown in.. Probably one of the more entertaining recent Spielberg films... it was a bit too long but other than that i rather enjoyed it.","Ready Player One",1722,3.5,0.5
"1723",4.5,"  Amazing, loved all the 80s and 90s references. A must see!!!","Ready Player One",1723,3.5,-1
"1724",4.5,"  I find it to be an amazing movie, I will definitely watch it again! Great characters and online personas!","Ready Player One",1724,3.5,-1
"1725",1,"  If you loved the books the movie is going to suck. It felt like someone took the concept of the book and rewrote almost all the of interactions and text of the story. I was so distracted how little movie followed the book that I was constantly distracted. Two thumbs down and .5 stars.","Ready Player One",1725,3.5,2.5
"1726",5,"  This movie throws everything I loved growing up and hits you with it in rapid fire succession for 2.5 hours and I loved every second of it! For a partially animated movie Ready Player One has surprising emotional resonnance! Run..dont walk and see this one! #ReadyPlayerOne","Ready Player One",1726,3.5,-1.5
"1727",5,"  awsome film about memory.","Ready Player One",1727,3.5,-1.5
"1728",4,"  a fun movie with so many nostalgic references you can't NOT like this movie. Visually stunning, but i recommend you see it in IMAX 3D.","Ready Player One",1728,3.5,-0.5
"1729",5,"  (SPOILER) The only thing that I thought was a bit weird was the fact that all 5 main chars lived so close to one another","Ready Player One",1729,3.5,-1.5
"1730",2.5,"  If you have not read the book of Ready Player One, you will not be disappointed with this movie. It's a fun, colourful and often funny adrenaline packed adventure, stuffed with nostalgia and references, sure to please movie lovers everywhere. HOWEVER, if you are like me and have the read the book and enjoyed it (the book is my all time favourite), you will be very disappointed. THIS IS YOUR OFFICIAL SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! From the first moment Wade enters the Oasis, one of the most iconic parts of the book, and the source of the book's name, is absent. By this I mean that the retro 'Ready Player One' starting screen that is described to happen before a player enters the Oasis is nowhere to be seen. But believe me when I tell you it gets worse. There is no Ludus (the school planet), the first challenge that in the book is the Tomb of Horrors and the copper key is a match of joust with the Lich King is replaced for an unexplained car race through New York that holds no reference or apparent connection to Halliday's life. And guess what. There are no gates. No gates whatsoever. Oh and I forgot to mention that Wade and Art3mis meet in real life just after the stacks are blown up, when they aren't supposed to meet until THE VERY END OF THE STORY The second challenge is substituted for a Shining challenge, which is unlikeable to say the very least. This is when we get some semblance to the book, with the final challenge being relatively accurate, apart from the fact that Daito is killed in the real world in the book, a moment that pulls on the heartstrings, is omitted from the movie. So, if you have not read Ready Player One, I recommend the movie. But if you have read the book, do not go watch the movie because you will find that the major plot points are changed almost to the point that they are unrecognisable.","Ready Player One",1730,3.5,1
"1731",5,"  Ok. This movie is unique but familiar. Its a fun and exhilarating ride from start to finish. Its story has heart and has an emotional tug though not a tearjerker. A movie shown on Easter, full of easter eggs and about an easter egg. So many cameos and references that it evokes earlier memories from a screen goer like me. Well made. Watch it. 5 stars","Ready Player One",1731,3.5,-1.5
"1732",4,"  AND WE HAVE OUR SURPRISE MOVIE OF 2018....So far and no not an April Fools joke. Based on the book, In the year 2045 people can escape reality into the virtual world into OASIS, an immersive virtual world where you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own imagination. The creator has passed away years ago and has left the ultimate prize for the player to who is able to find the mcguffins that will lead to wealth and full ownership of the game itself. But of course an evil organisation is out to get it and take control. Halo, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, The Iron Giant, Mine craft, Halo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Battle toads and a hell of a lot more appear in this so quickly that some if you blink you will miss them. The soundtrack, wow! Again got that classic 80's thing going on which is fantastic. The Cast is wow also. could go on forever about it but yeah... Need to watch this a few times but for me this was really enjoyable with Speilberg doing what he does best, Entertaining the audience. Classic Speilberg that will go down as one of his greats! Go and See it! 4 Stars.","Ready Player One",1732,3.5,-0.5
"1733",5,"  Amazing journey loved everything about it!","Ready Player One",1733,3.5,-1.5
"1734",2,"  It was a beautifully filmed and directed... bad film","Ready Player One",1734,3.5,1.5
"1735",4,"  m-a tinut captivat pana la final. a avut un pacing foarte bun. scena de la inceput cu race-ul a fost foarte tare. si a vorbit de cateva teme interesante.","Ready Player One",1735,3.5,-0.5
"1736",5,"  Ready Player One proves that master director Steven Spielberg still has that same magic touch he used to enthral audiences in classics such as Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Last Ark and E.T.! The story is touching and compelling and doesn't get lost or overwhelmed in the hundreds of nostalgic cameos and seamless computer graphics. The script veers far from the novel it's based on but that's in service to the movie's momentum, which travels at a light speed breakneck pace in spite of its lengthy running time. Geeks of all ages will delight (and be a bit overwhelmed) by all the Easter Eggs (I'd love to share some of them with you but the fun is in the finding). While book purists may be disappointed that some of their favorite cameos don't make it, the ones that do (along with their replacements) will bring uncontrollable smiles to their faces.This is one roller coaster ride that you hope will never end and when it does, you'll just want to get back on to recapture the thrill over and over again. Must-See!","Ready Player One",1736,3.5,-1.5
"1737",5,"  Amazeballs gamer life 4 ever","Ready Player One",1737,3.5,-1.5
"1738",2,"  Paper thin characters and huge plot holes. Took an amazing book, took out everything that made it special and put as many things on the screen at the same time as they could. Spielberg what happened to you? How did you screw this up? It was already written. All you had to do was film it.","Ready Player One",1738,3.5,1.5
"1739",5,"  A fun, thrilling ride and full of awesomeness from start to finish, that will unleash your childhood experienced. A mesmerizing film that you want to take back to the future, Jurassic park and all of the classic things happen on 80's and 90's. Easily one of the best films this year and probably will put this on your top list. Steven Spielberg and Ernest Cline manages the movie to be more related to us (Millennials) and the future generation. As terrifying and painful as reality can be, it's also the only place where you can find the happiness, but remember that real things happen in the real world and that's the thing.","Ready Player One",1739,3.5,-1.5
"1740",5,"  Very well imagines, cast, filmed and produced. 80's pop culture references are right on.","Ready Player One",1740,3.5,-1.5
"1741",5,"  Saw it three times, just an amazing and pure film with an important message.","Ready Player One",1741,3.5,-1.5
"1742",5,"  BEST MOVIE EVER!!! I LOVE THE STYLE OF THE GAMES AND ALL THE CHARATERS FROM OTHER GAMES WAS IN IT!!!!!!!","Ready Player One",1742,3.5,-1.5
"1743",5,"  Fantastic and fun movie I'll definitely have to rewatch to catch all of the pop culture references","Ready Player One",1743,3.5,-1.5
"1744",5,"  So much fun for the family and we all enjoyed it!","Ready Player One",1744,3.5,-1.5
"1745",0.5,"  A full of cameos movie without any interesting history. It tries to be funny but is not. Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.","Ready Player One",1745,3.5,3
"1746",5,"  For some reason, the nerd community seems very divisive about this movie. Personally, I enjoyed the book. I must have plowed through it in like three days. I think the movie version of RP1 does take a lot away from the book, but it also fixes some of the parts of the book I wasn't happy with. The challenges for the keys are different, but still very enjoyable. Chalk that up to having to use what Spielberg and Warner's had license for. I really enjoyed it and I've seen it twice already opening weekend. We constantly complain that the studios are rebooting everything and that we don't get anything new and fresh. Well, this is new, fresh, different and damn fun!","Ready Player One",1746,3.5,-1.5
"1747",5,"  omg! best movie ever!..this is far more real than Jesus!","Ready Player One",1747,3.5,-1.5
"1748",4.5,"  It was a very entertaining movie with a lot of in depth characterisation and delevopment of platonic relationships. The forced romance is what made it lose half a star. If it wasn't so self aware, it would have been cringy, but seems like the director knows how to please his target audience.","Ready Player One",1748,3.5,-1
"1749",2,"  Giving this film 2 stars for making the ""Oasis"" look gorgeous. Cringy dialogue, bad characters, forced romance, and out of place references really killed this movie. Awesome as a comedy though.","Ready Player One",1749,3.5,1.5
"1750",4,"  This movie takes the basic structure and characters from the book, and trims it down to fit the smaller narrative the movie format allows. It's a lot easier going into this movie looking at it as a separate product than the book, since the specifics of the movie are very different from the book. The book is better, but the movie is done in a respectful manner and is a good product on its own.","Ready Player One",1750,3.5,-0.5
"1751",5,"  The perfect movie for the perfect time.","Ready Player One",1751,3.5,-1.5
"1752",5,"  a really enjoyable adventure, definitely gonna watch it more than twice, so many easter eggs, so many characters i like. my favourite movie so far this year.","Ready Player One",1752,3.5,-1.5
"1753",0.5,"  Ready Player One has a bland protagonist, weak casting and terrible dialogue, but what made me stay in the cinema was seeing my favorite character being put on the big screen but references don't make a good movie, good acting, relatable charters and plot which Ready Player One has none of.","Ready Player One",1753,3.5,3
"1754",3,"  I read the book and must have watched the trailer and trailer reactions on YouTube at least 20 times. I was SUPER SUPER excited to watch the movie and just left the theater a few hours ago after watching it on 3D with my friends. Wow... what a let down.It felt rushed. I was so excited by all the early reviews and how everyone keeps saying Steven Spielberg is back. I loved his early films and was super excited he would take on this project. Although his last feels have all been disappointing. I had high hopes after all the trailer reactions and early reviews. I have not been to the theater in years and was so excited to see what he could do.Again, I was let down. Not angry or anything. Just disappointed. I was hoping for something that would give me the excitement and possibilities that the trailer showed. Instead, it was just a teen movie without a lot of emotions.The love that develops between Artemis and Parzival felt really rushed. His aunt dies and he's kidnapped by Artemis' friend and he falls for her right away and the part when he parts her hair is just ridiculous. ARGH.... I mean, I enjoyed the movie. But it's nothing like what it could have been. Someone else might have made it better.I just didnt feel much emotion. Until towards the end when Gundam showed up. But even then, it was fleeting. If there's a sequel I hope someone else directs. I hope there's a remake of it by someone else in the future who can do it right.","Ready Player One",1754,3.5,0.5
"1755",0.5,"  Extremely disappointing; does no justice to the book.","Ready Player One",1755,3.5,3
"1756",4,"  The beggining felt slow but I think that was needed to set up the incredible nostalgic thrill ride that's to come. Everything past the 10m mark was just pure unfiltered fun. If you want a movie that's really deep and filled with emotional messages and plenty of character growth (like I believe many top critics did) then it's the wrong movie. But if you want some seriously intelligent fun then this is perfect. The transition between the OASIS and the real world never felt forced and the action was amazing and the apparently-now-essential 3rd act SGI explosion extravigansa was brilliantly done. Obe of my favourite final battles since the avengers.","Ready Player One",1756,3.5,-0.5
"1757",4.5,"  In short, classical Spielberg at his best with a fresh material on his hands to work with he makes another great hit. Entirely enjoyable and worth watching. It's always very difficult to restrain yourself from judging the movie when you have read the book before. I felt that this movie, while it may have not stayed entirely true to the book, was just right not just for the people who grew up in 80s and 90s but also for the kids the young audience today. And maybe it's better that it had it's own version of the story, because it leaves you plenty of room to enjoy the book after.","Ready Player One",1757,3.5,-1
"1758",5,"  This is probably my favourite movie of all time. The story is good, the visuals are beyond amazing, and the movie as a whole is just generally breathtaking. If you haven't watched it yet then please do.","Ready Player One",1758,3.5,-1.5
"1759",5,"  Wonderful movie and very well done Steven Spielberg...","Ready Player One",1759,3.5,-1.5
"1760",4.5,"  While there is tons of pop culture references as window dressing, a great Spielbergian adventure film can be found underneath. I felt it was overall an improvement upon the novel and I feel like the concept was really done justice here.","Ready Player One",1760,3.5,-1
"1761",5,"  Spielberg make it again!!!! It's so good......not any moment was wasted!!","Ready Player One",1761,3.5,-1.5
"1762",5,"  Just watched at Hoyts xtremescreen, highly recommended, so much good memory, so much easter eggs, so 70s, 80s, 90s good stuffs","Ready Player One",1762,3.5,-1.5
"1763",3.5,"  As with most Spielberg movies, it is good storytelling. Decent characters and story. A good time at the movie- after one gets over the CGI world/actors. Good pace and the right length.","Ready Player One",1763,3.5,0
"1764",5,"  TODOS A VERLA LCDSM!!! #bestmovie #ever #madeforme #totallygotit","Ready Player One",1764,3.5,-1.5
"1765",5,"  This is a super fun movie!","Ready Player One",1765,3.5,-1.5
"1766",5,"  Ready Player One is undoubtedly one of Steven Spielberg's best directed films. The pop culture references were spot on and not forced, I loved all of the characters, and the storyline felt like a masterpiece written in the 80's stowed away to be filmed today. Everyone should watch this movie in theaters because its definitely one to remember.","Ready Player One",1766,3.5,-1.5
"1767",4,"  Everything in this movie is an Easter Egg. Good choice of a release date weekend.","Ready Player One",1767,3.5,-0.5
"1768",4,"  Very different from the book, but didn't disappoint.","Ready Player One",1768,3.5,-0.5
"1769",0.5,"  This movie didn't even come close to the book. What a letdown. I was so looking forward to it. What is it with Hollywood. Do they even read the book?","Ready Player One",1769,3.5,3
"1770",4,"  I so wish I hadn't read the book first. Because I am one of those people who is gonna say the book is far superior to the film. However, in no way is the film bad. The changes made make sense, some changes are just purely alien to me and still baffle me. The characters were fairly bland, except for Art3mis and Halliday who, to me, were the most interesting and developed characters (which again upsets me as Wade, AKA the main protagonist and the character we follow in the film, is the best character in the book). Pacing in this film is also fantastic as it never felt like a 2hr20min film. However due to this breakneck speed, some of the extremely developed plot points in the book are completely glossed over, which again is a flaw that the film has. To reiterate, I think the movie is great. However, I can't say it is better than the book.","Ready Player One",1770,3.5,-0.5
"1771",4.5,"  Moviegoer goer could be on the opposite end for this one. You either love it, or you don't get it. First if you looking for great script, emotional screenplay, or deep thinking then this is not the movie for you. RPO in short is a huge fanfest for pop culture from 50/60s all the way to current day, it has almost every pop culture icon he (Steven Spielberg) can get his hands on, from music to cartoon to movie to TV show to anime and much more. Everyone should be able to find something they related to or recognized.Spoil alert: It is extremely fun watching hello kitty walking alone side beetlejuice, Gundam fighting MechaGodzilla, Ryu racing with Lara croft and much more. Isn't that all part of our childhood fantasy? It is definitely a great movie for Easter weekend especially the theme is all about easter egg hunt (both in the movie story and irl fans trying to spot all hidden message/character).","Ready Player One",1771,3.5,-1
"1772",5,NA,"Ready Player One",1772,3.5,-1.5
"1773",1,"  This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. It's as though Zak Penn and Steven Spielberg had a 5 minute conversation with Ernest Cline and forgot to take notes. The same key words can be found in both the book and the movie, however the plot has been twisted into nothing for the big screen and all of the magic lost along the way. Save your money and read the book. The nostalgia is plentiful and the story progresses at an appropriate rate to allow for exposition and to build tension. The movie? Took some ideas from the book, put them in a blender with corporate sponsors that are no better that IOI themselves and destroyed a beautiful thing.","Ready Player One",1773,3.5,2.5
"1774",5,"  This was a really amazing movie! It's clear that they made it a tad dumbed down for the movie adaptation, but if you really enjoyed the book you will still have a fun time with this movie looking for the callbacks and easter eggs. As well as that, the visual interpretation of the story that Ernest Cline wrote was incredibly clever in it's ability to take a story that had a incredlibly large amount of time hopping, explination, and narration to create a will thought out and followable movie.","Ready Player One",1774,3.5,-1.5
"1775",3.5,"  The book is better but that's nearly always the case. Despite missing large sections of the book it always feels a litttle rushed with some elements from the book included which didn't need to be and others missing that sure have been. As a result the character development is not all it could have been. Some of the action scenes are overly fanetic. Some of the cgi is not quite up to par (even allowing for the fact they're supposed to look like computed generated avatars). Despite all that it's entertaining and worth a watch. But don't think if you've seen the film there's no point in reading the book, they both differ significantly.","Ready Player One",1775,3.5,0
"1776",3.5,"  The film doesn't incorporate the elements of our main characters struggles enough for the audience to feel a true connection to him. The issue such as never leaving Lydia because he didn't have enough coin to teleport. Or the fact that he had a level 3 avatar forever prior to finding the first challenge and winning the copper key in the D&D simulation after beating the Demi Liche at Joust. I wish they would have kept the screen play closer to the original story.","Ready Player One",1776,3.5,0
"1777",5,"  Amazingly fun popcorn flick. Highly recommend to anyone that grew up through the 80s, and even to a younger crowd as well.","Ready Player One",1777,3.5,-1.5
"1778",4,"  1. clever multi-level entertainment: parents will love nonstop 80s memes2. Kids might start to think of video games as worthy & meaningful.3. Only Spielberg could get away with so many copyright liberties.","Ready Player One",1778,3.5,-0.5
"1779",4,"  I listened to the audio book and thought it was entertaining, even though there were several too-convenient plot elements. The audio book is roughly 17 hours to listen to, so cramming so much into a 2 hour movie must have been difficult. They obviously had to change story elements to adapt this film, but it felt like they might have stretched the plot too thin. You really get to understand the characters in the book, but in the movie they feel very underdeveloped. Some of the scene transitions felt confusing also, where I would be asking more questions before others were answered.Now that I got the criticism out of the way... WOW! There were some amazing scenes in this movie that had me grinning and geeking out like a little kid. There are nostalgic scenes all over the place, sure, but the movie doesn't try to bombard you with nearly as many completely obscure references like the book did. The futuristic live-action set pieces were awesome to look at and I enjoyed them just as much as all of the scenes in the Oasis. It's a really fun movie. Even though the runtime was 2 hours and 20 minutes, it felt much shorter than that. I would recommend seeing it in the theater to take in all of the eye candy. It's worth it for the opening scene alone.","Ready Player One",1779,3.5,-0.5
"1780",5,"  ""Phenomenal direction, incredible casting, and amazing nostalgia, add those together and you'll get one of the best pictures of 2018! The action sequences are extremely well done and eye-popping, the story in this film is superb, and this is without a doubt the most amazing work Steven Spielberg has ever done! I'll be honest here when I say that I was watching this film as a hawk for flaws but here's the thing, I never found one! That's how amazing this filim is! With the right premise, laugh out loud humor, and using 3D the right way possible, this is the film for all nerds everywhere for what can I say? Nerds rule!""","Ready Player One",1780,3.5,-1.5
"1781",3,"  Although a good watch, there are some lulls. Additionally, another movie by the name of Wreck-It Ralph did this already and did so much better.","Ready Player One",1781,3.5,0.5
"1782",5,"  Ready Player One is a masterclass showing from Steven Spielberg at his full potential, combining a riveting story with compelling characters together with awesome pop culture references and spectacular action sequences to create a sweet and entertaining ride for the audience, especially those who are lovers of movies and games.","Ready Player One",1782,3.5,-1.5
"1783",5,"  OH MY GOD. THIS MOVIE WAS LIQUID HAPPINESS. SUCH AN AMAZING ADVENTURE. I CRIED.","Ready Player One",1783,3.5,-1.5
"1784",0.5,"  ???????????????? People like this shit?!!","Ready Player One",1784,3.5,3
"1785",0.5,"  Honestly one of the worst book to movie adaptations I've ever watched, it was a severely watered down version of what was a great story. Every twist is explained to you, every relationship rushed, and every character a ghost of themselves made purely to aid the main character suddenly. Artemis took the biggest hit, she reduced from intelligent to a ""hot girl"" that Wade obsesses over and who hands every clue to him because he's somehow more qualified to win the game. You couldn't pay me to waste hours of life again watching this garbage.","Ready Player One",1785,3.5,3
"1786",5,"  Amazing movie!!! I want to see it again and can't wait for BluRay!! Spielberg once again has me rooting for all the characters and keeps the flow moving throughout the whole movie really well. Amazing action, stunning visuals and great story. And lets be honest here. If you take away every poor review that gripes about how they don't like it because its nothing like the book, the audience score would be over 90%. Sad that people are scoring the translation to big screen from book instead of the movie by itself.","Ready Player One",1786,3.5,-1.5
"1787",4,"  Different than the book but that just meant it couldn't ruin the great things that made the book such an enjoyable novel. Interesting take on the story and we'll worth seeing again","Ready Player One",1787,3.5,-0.5
"1788",5,"  The movie intelligently links many ideas of the genres it expresses and highlights and for lack of a better word the movie is riddled with Easter eggs that aren't always just given to you but where you would actually have to know the subject matter of said easter egg to understand them. Spielberg sets up a beautiful world in his classic fashion of making things seem like they could really be, and then he shows us all the good the bad and the in between of that wonderful world that makes it feel even more alive. Overall a great movie and a classic I would gladly see twice in theaters !","Ready Player One",1788,3.5,-1.5
"1789",4,"  See this one in Imax 3d if you can. worth it.","Ready Player One",1789,3.5,-0.5
"1790",2.5,"  It was entertaining but nothing revolutionary. The movie fixes a lot of the really questionable things about the book and makes Parzival a bit more of an actual person. It's nothing amazing - it relies on the nostalgia factor too much, the romance subplot had me physically cringing, and the ""philosophy"" it tries to convey is absolutely absurd too - but it's definitely fun if you want to just escape the world for a few hours.","Ready Player One",1790,3.5,1
"1791",5,"  One of the best movie i have EVER seen . MUST SEE.","Ready Player One",1791,3.5,-1.5
"1792",5,"  Absolute masterpiece","Ready Player One",1792,3.5,-1.5
"1793",5,"  The scores for this are lower than the quality of the film so I gave it 5 stars great movie that I definitely will watch again. Maybe not in the theater but I will likely buy it","Ready Player One",1793,3.5,-1.5
"1794",1,"  Wow, shocking how bad this was! The book at least had highlights too bad all of them were left out to make room for new lows. Even the clever twists were sort of let downs. Dont watch.","Ready Player One",1794,3.5,2.5
"1795",5,"  This movie is great and is a pretty good adaptation of the novel. Go see it","Ready Player One",1795,3.5,-1.5
"1796",2.5,"  Ambitious start, but never delivered the feel or plot line of the book. Special effects were spectacular, but not enough to make the movie worth your time or money.","Ready Player One",1796,3.5,1
"1797",5,"  Best movie with MechaGodzilla fighting Gundam and Iron Giant Scene ever!!!","Ready Player One",1797,3.5,-1.5
"1798",1,"  Saw that with my dad and either we are too old for that kind of movie or we did not get it ...cheezy story .was not expecting a cartoon movie ...it remember the olld Tron from the 80. But did had few funny part ...not impress Thank","Ready Player One",1798,3.5,2.5
"1799",4,"  heck of a lot of fun","Ready Player One",1799,3.5,-0.5
"1800",0.5,"  The changes from the book are neither an improvement on the storyline or in general. This is sadly a case of a great book poorly translated to a movie. Which sucks.","Ready Player One",1800,3.5,3
"1801",4,"  Super action packed and filled with loads of pop culture/video game/music and movie culture. However, as a fan of the novel, I was disappointed at how far away from the original plot the film strayed, I understand changes had to be made, but I found it hard to let go of the Ready Player One I know and love from reading and to just enjoy the film as produced. That is really my only criticism.","Ready Player One",1801,3.5,-0.5
"1802",3.5,"  A balanced mix between action and nostalgia, set on a dystopian world from which we only got glimpses, but that seems hiding something way more elaborated. The movie itself is an adventure well set on it's time, without major plots holes but clearly some aspects that still require some answers.","Ready Player One",1802,3.5,0
"1803",5,"  This movie is literally jaw dropping from start to finish. Seriously, my mouth hung open through most of it the cinematography is that good.","Ready Player One",1803,3.5,-1.5
"1804",3,"  Don't play. That's the message being presented to the audience in the film version of Ernest Cline's Ready Player One. There are other ways to prosper besides playing the game. Don't run the race. You can never hope to win it. Instead, drive your car backward and avoid the race altogether in order to cross the finish line. This is Halliday's message to the younger generation. Don't be like me. Don't play the game. The film is not a love letter to the pop culture of the 1980's. It is a rejection of them. It is a rejection of the gamer. It is a rejection of the film geek. Rather than bringing him joy, confidence and fulfillment, the amusements of Halliday's youth imprison him. Listless, lifeless and dispassionate, he is a far cry from his forbearer, the lively, expressive, emotional, and unpredictable Willy Wonka. Halliday loves video games, and television shows, and movies and music. And yet, he is the one that gets the unhappy ending. What does that say to the core audience watching this? It says, everything you geek out about is drivel. Wade doesn't dress up like Buckaroo Bonzai because he loves the character. He runs through punk, Duran Duran and the rest, because he wants to impress the girl. That's fine. But what character does he love? Who are his favorites? Surely there must be something in his time period that excites him? Without us knowing this, Wade seems hollow. He's not really a fan of the 80's. The characters that Halliday adores, Wade exploits for his personal gain. Much in the same way this movie does. Some fans of the novel are complaining that there was no Ultraman in the movie, or that Spielberg replaced Leopardon with the Iron Giant and so on. But that's where I think the problem lies with this movie. Everything is interchangeable. So much so, that it doesn't matter who appears. King Kong could easily have been Donkey Kong and it would not have changed the story in the least. Chucky could have been Pinhead from Puppet Master or even Jigsaw from Saw and the effect would have been the same. Essentially, by taking them out of their own worlds, this movie strips these iconic characters of any meaning and dignity. I don't care if the Batmobile is in the movie because it doesn't change the plot one bit. I like Batman, but I want to see him fighting the Joker in Gotham City, not being used as decoration in a movie where his appearance has no weight. In this regard Batman becomes no different that Mr. Clean or Ronald McDonald. He's a spokesperson for the movie and that's it. In this same regard, the use of The Shining is particularly depressing. In the novel, the use of War Games made sense. Wade was acting out his fantasy of being the snarky hip guy, ala Matthew Broderick. It served a purpose. It gave the reader more insight into what the 1980's felt like. It was a vehicle to get Wade into the decade he knew so much about. But here the Shining is reduced to the interchangeable villain. It could have been any classic horror movie and it would not have mattered, except The Shining is too complex to work as the next boss to be defeated. That must be why those stupid zombies were added. If you wanted zombies, there are plenty of other movies you could have picked. But in this movie, everything is cynically lumped together. C3P0, Terminator, Daleks and Marvin over there in that bin - you're all robots. Kermit could be Yoda. Who cares? The average gamer isn't represented by Wade in this movie. The gamer is represented by the IOI in this movie. Play an Atari game and try to win by its own rules and into the ice you fall. Video Games. Movies. Television Shows. Music. These are currency to Wade and his friends. No different than the coins they collect. How could a movie with Chucky, Battlestar Galactica, Freddy, and the hundreds, if not thousands, of other iconic characters on display here be so detached about the source material? Don't play. In fact, you can win before the game even starts. Go find the Easter egg in Adventure. It's there. You have to forget about the rules to find it. Except now that you've won, you must sign the lawyer's papers, even though you just said contracts didn't feel right about five minutes ago. And sign them without objection you do. Welcome to the corporation Wade. It is at the ending of the movie, ironically, with all the interchangeable characters out of the way, when we finally have a real homage to the decade. The cops come out and arrest the bad guy. They aren't future cops. They are 1980's cops and the scene is straight out of one of the buddy cop films of the day. The villain drops his gun, gets thrown in the back of the cop car, and starts arguing with the other baddie. It was funny and heartfelt. It didn't feel forced. So much else seemed like it was more about showing off whom the filmmakers got the right to use. Ready Player One. Pixels. Stranger Things. RIP the 1980s. At least for another thirty years or so.","Ready Player One",1804,3.5,0.5
"1805",1,"  Boring souless piece of crap. Sad since I loved the book.","Ready Player One",1805,3.5,2.5
"1806",5,"  Amazing!!! A must see on the big screen, Loved the story, the references, the characters, the visuals, Loved Everything about this movie!!!","Ready Player One",1806,3.5,-1.5
"1807",0.5,"  Not even close to the book. Terribly written. Rushed.","Ready Player One",1807,3.5,3
"1808",4.5,"  Changed A LOT from the book, more than what most adaptations change, but it what it did change it did very well. They changed the ending slightly to make it flow better and make more sense. If you go in expecting the book to be used as a script, you'll be disapointed. If you go in as a fan of the universe the book is set in, and want to see an underdog kick some ass from the seat of a Delorian, you'll love it as much as I did. 4.5/5 Stars.","Ready Player One",1808,3.5,-1
"1809",5,"  Fun movie. I liked the book and also enjoyed the film version.","Ready Player One",1809,3.5,-1.5
"1810",1,"  Not quite sure what this move is, but it isn't Ready Player One. I really wish JJ Abrams or Jon Favreau or any of the new directors had gotten it. I was so afraid Spielberg wasn't up to the challenge and would twist it to fit his vision rather than the other way around. I was right. This movie lost the soul of the book... such a shame but because he didn't have to change it. Ridley Scott nailed The Martian because he stayed true and made it about the great story that it was. Spielberg made it about himself.","Ready Player One",1810,3.5,2.5
"1811",4,"  Was fun and interesting. I recommend it.","Ready Player One",1811,3.5,-0.5
"1812",3.5,"  Acceptable adaptation of the book. I personally think they made the main character too normal looking. The book was better, but I still enjoyed the movie. Has enough nostalgia for those of us who grew up in the 80/90's and modern enough for kids of today to still relate.","Ready Player One",1812,3.5,0
"1813",1.5,"  The movie follows the main plot and the characters of the book but the way they find the keys shoto dying at the hands of ioi perzival infiltrating ioi to set up a robot to destroy the force field and the robots they get after finishing the second gate","Ready Player One",1813,3.5,2
"1814",0.5,"  It is very clear that Spielberg, did not even bother reading the book this movie was based on. The movie failed to show the world of the Oasis, in what it's true glory was, rather it is JUST a video game. The movie failed to even have an INKLING of the distopia world of the book. And the story, well its as close to the book as the world war Z movie stayed true to the book. I saw another reviewer say no one will remember this movie in 20 years, I disagree, I doubt anyone will remember this movie in 5 years.","Ready Player One",1814,3.5,3
"1815",3,"  The way the book handled the plot line and characters was MUCH better. I understand that a lot of the plot didn't translate well to a visual film, but there were too many details I LOVED from the book that didn't make it to the film. Overall, an enjoyable movie, and if I had not read the book I may have given it 4 instead of 3.","Ready Player One",1815,3.5,0.5
"1816",5,"  Great movie.....better message. Welcome back Mr. Spielberg.","Ready Player One",1816,3.5,-1.5
"1817",5,"  Incredible movie loved the movie and video game reference and the score was good","Ready Player One",1817,3.5,-1.5
"1818",5,"  It's Steven Spielberg, duh.","Ready Player One",1818,3.5,-1.5
"1819",3,"  So ready player one was alright. It had some good characters but not enough development and a villain with potential cause he was played by a pretty great actor but he wasn't a very good villain even though he could've been like he was in that great movie rogue one directed by Gareth MEHdwards haha see what I did there haha. If you like movies and video games and pop culture like me then I recommend it solely because there's so many REFERENCES. There's a whole sequence that revolves around my favorite horror film the shining that I liked to a certain extent. There's also a mayor Goldie Wilson poster from back to the future among many other Easter eggs and references so if you like that kind of stuff you may enjoy it I would go more in depth but I'm too lazy","Ready Player One",1819,3.5,0.5
"1820",4,"  Really good movie for nerds. The nostalgia adds to the film rather than the film being purely about nostalgia.","Ready Player One",1820,3.5,-0.5
"1821",3,"  Ready Player One, directed by Steven Spielberg, is occasionally fun and diverting but also occasionally dull and unsatisfying. Tye Sheridan plays Wade who goes to the virtual world of the Oasis as an escape from the crappy real world. In the virtual world he discovers that he can change his fortune if he finds three keys and an Easter egg. Along the way he and his friends face challenges to find the keys. The first challenge, a race, is fun and fast paced and full of great action. But the next two challenges get repetitive and it soon is clear that this film lacks stakes. At no point did I feel like there was a purpose for what the characters were doing when they were doing things. And that's where the film ultimately falls flat. But the visual effects are excellent and the score is fun and it almost picks itself up in the last act but ultimately doesn't. He does have a good message, although it's hidden almost as well as the Easter egg in the film and Ready Player One tries to be fun but loses steam once reality takes center stage.","Ready Player One",1821,3.5,0.5
"1822",4.5,"  The movie kinda rushes at the beginning; the first half of the book happens in about 15 minutes. That doesn't matter though. This movie is loaded with tons of smart raster eggs and cameos from characters from pop culture. It's really fun","Ready Player One",1822,3.5,-1
"1823",3.5,"  Very entertaining movie. Paced very well and didn't seem near as long as the listed run time.","Ready Player One",1823,3.5,0
"1824",5,"  I enjoyed the movie very much, you will diffidently get the best enjoyment from the movie if you have read the book, and understand the pop culture references","Ready Player One",1824,3.5,-1.5
"1825",5,"  Best book ever, best Spielberg movie ( I love his movies) and even without the references to pop culture it would be an epic movie anyway. My wife doesn't like pop culture at all and she said it was the best movie she has seen in years because it had s real story arc snd a payoff in the end.","Ready Player One",1825,3.5,-1.5
"1826",1,"  So untrue to the book that I am uncharacteristically mad about the movie. Movie was boring in many parts, and while it may have been ok filmmaking in the 80s, sorry, we're in 2018 and expect more.","Ready Player One",1826,3.5,2.5
"1827",5,"  Extremely fun ride of a movie, filled with nostalgia and very creative use of the dualistic world, both real and virtual. A few moments of cliche and corniness, but nothing that detracts too much. You'll leave with a smile on your face.","Ready Player One",1827,3.5,-1.5
"1828",5,"  Just left theatre OH how I loved all the things that came about in this movie. Let's just say it was pretty cool","Ready Player One",1828,3.5,-1.5
"1829",1,"  A complete and utter disappointment from Spielberg, if I were the book's author I would sue....this is not the 80's iconic story that was told by the author and just another mediocre sci-fi love story poorly executed by a producer that should meet the same fate.","Ready Player One",1829,3.5,2.5
"1830",2,"  Video killed the paperback star. DID Spielberg even read the book.? The movie was stripped of all references neigh adventure at the end. The keys were all wrong there were no gate challenges. Everything about the Oisis that I loved was not even there. And what's up with the whole unplug vibe? The movie was nothing like the book and I am personally sick of directors who tear apart a book and make crap movie that don't even make sense. Come on Spielberg what gives I want want my 2 hours back.","Ready Player One",1830,3.5,1.5
"1831",4,"  Ready Player One is one hell of a ride, with tons of good old thrills, the special effects are amazing, spoting every single reference adds more to the experience, some are easy to scatch others would require to watch the movie 2 or more times to spot them, the music is great but I think they could have put more songs, but the ones that are in are really good, the essence of the book is there, and they try to respect that as much as they can but it was obvious that they would change a lot from the book in order to make the movie, don't expect to see the same. The characters are likeable but it can be the weakest point, and while the story in the book is more tragic in the movie it changes to be more ""friendly"" The 3D adds more to the experience, and you should go to watch it in the biggest screen that you could find.","Ready Player One",1831,3.5,-0.5
"1832",0.5,"  Worst movie of my life. Watching it right now and want to die.","Ready Player One",1832,3.5,3
"1833",5,"  So far my favorite movie of the year.","Ready Player One",1833,3.5,-1.5
"1834",5,"  I was born in 71 - right in the sweetspot for this movie - I played Adventure, Spielberg and Lucas productions fueled my imagination, and then I learned not only that it was OK to be a geek or weird, but to celebrate it thanks to the John Hughes.I was not expecting to love this movie and it would got he way of John Carter, Valerian, Star Wars Prequels and Transformers sequels.This movie exceeded expectations on all counts. Not every movie needs a purpose beyond entertainment, Most people don't ride a roller coaster to find themselves, they just want entertainment. Go in with the expectation of being entertained - nothing more nothing less.Oh and I'l be seeing it again to go find the easter eggs I missed in the first viewing.","Ready Player One",1834,3.5,-1.5
"1835",4.5,"  The book is one of my favorites, and even though the movie is different, I really liked it, too.","Ready Player One",1835,3.5,-1
"1836",4.5,"  Great popcorn movie. Not the strongest plot nor unique plot twists, but it's a huge adventure film that will keep you interested throughout out. Strong laughs, fantastic easter eggs, and the acting (even though most is cgi) is not bad at all. Listen, if you want to go and just enjoy 2 hours with people, munching popcorn and sipping Coke, this is definitely a movie to see.","Ready Player One",1836,3.5,-1
"1837",5,"  Ready player one is one if not the best movie I have ever seen it has every thing it need to be on of the greatest movies of all time the only thing it's to short for how long the story is this is my favorite movie off all time","Ready Player One",1837,3.5,-1.5
"1838",3,"  Its an ok film but honestly i dont feel it did the book justice","Ready Player One",1838,3.5,0.5
"1839",1,"  I went in knowing it wouldn't be like the book, but I didn't expect it to be entirely different. If I just judge it as a stand alone work, it was really bad. ZERO character development. We had no idea who any of these people were, what OASIS was really like, what the real world was like. Yes, there were lots of nostalgic references interspersed, but that wasn't enough to carry the film. Think of any Spielberg movie you love - there are memorable characters, a memorable soundtrack. In 20 years no one will remember this movie.","Ready Player One",1839,3.5,2.5
"1840",5,"  YOUR NUTS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEE NIT YET!!! SOLD OUT HERE IN GEORGIA!","Ready Player One",1840,3.5,-1.5
"1841",4,"  A very fun flick. Better than the book.","Ready Player One",1841,3.5,-0.5
"1842",2.5,"  I loved the book and have read/listened to it many, many times. Rush, Joust, Tempest, Zork-Ernest Cline had my number. LOVED IT. But I knew it was unfilmable. Everything in the trailers has been a confirmation. Have since seen it and, while it has some nice touches, I won't see it again. It's like the Atari 2600 port of your favorite video arcade game.","Ready Player One",1842,3.5,1
"1843",4,"  (8.5/10)Ready Player One is very much a blast to watch. The film has mixed messages in the way it portrays pop culture fans, and it doesn't have as much character and world development as much as you want it to. However, you can't deny that Spielberg is a master of adventure thrill rides.","Ready Player One",1843,3.5,-0.5
"1844",3.5,"  This is not the story you read if you read the book...honestly, not even close. Very loosely based around the concept of the Oasis and the search for the Easter Egg and with several key concepts pulled out of the book to build the story around, but it's not the same plot, not the same riddles, not the same emphasis on pop-culture. Go in without having read the book and I think you could leave with a great experience. If you've read the book, you're going to see some of the visuals from the book reproduced on the screen, not for the story you read. Visually (I saw it on IMAX 3D) it is fantastic. Story wise, Spielberg took it in a totally different direction.","Ready Player One",1844,3.5,0
"1845",5,"  Not like anybody reads anymore, but it was very true to the book. Some parts were skipped, but that is to be expected. Visually, it was stunning. Full of pop culture references and Easter eggs, but they were used meaningfully and believably (as opposed to movies that do it for the sake of ""appealing to the kiddos""). Great movie, highly reccomend!","Ready Player One",1845,3.5,-1.5
"1846",4,NA,"Ready Player One",1846,3.5,-0.5
"1847",5,"  Outstanding fun!! Saw it twice already probably going for a third time too. And that did not happen since the Matrix days that I would go see a film more than once.","Ready Player One",1847,3.5,-1.5
"1848",5,"  Great film. Spielberg did a great job and the story was great.","Ready Player One",1848,3.5,-1.5
"1849",2,"  i made the bad mistake of reading the book first before seeing the book as the hype was real. but after seeing th movie and not taking the book into account? the movie is a decent, at best, standalone from the book. it has roughly 3-4 things that were true to the book and even more so that were true to typical hollywood stereotypes. As its own movie i enjoyed it enough but what killed it for me was there were a lot of plot holes. if not for the plot holes i'd give a 3.5/5 otherwise this is getting a 2 at best from me.","Ready Player One",1849,3.5,1.5
"1850",2,"  It was barely comprehensable from a story point and suffered from visual overload.","Ready Player One",1850,3.5,1.5
"1851",1,"  Most likely the worst rendition of a book I've ever seen. Great book, but this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the movie..This was just a forgettable cash grab by hollywood","Ready Player One",1851,3.5,2.5
"1852",5,"  It wasn't nearly as good as the book, but I loved that Spielberg made it a little different for the fans of the book. Very well done!","Ready Player One",1852,3.5,-1.5
"1853",3,"  Quite an enjoyable ride. Glad to see Spielberg back in gear with another blockbuster, and even if this one's not too deep, it still has a sliver of heart to its adventure.","Ready Player One",1853,3.5,0.5
"1854",2,"  While the movie was good and the CGI was on point, it was nothing CLOSE to the book. VERY disappointing!","Ready Player One",1854,3.5,1.5

"1856",3.5,"  bello ma non bellissimo","Ready Player One",1856,3.5,0
"1857",5,"  I honestly loved the hell out of this movie. There's really nothing I wish I could change, just add. As again, books will always have more than the movie counterpart, but it was astonishing seeing it play on the big screen.","Ready Player One",1857,3.5,-1.5
"1858",4.5,"  In case anyone is wondering,, Definitely worth the 3D XD funds spent on the movie.","Ready Player One",1858,3.5,-1
"1859",1,"  What the fresh hell was that.","Ready Player One",1859,3.5,2.5
"1860",3,"  Although it tries its best to fit all the facts and pop culture references from the book, Ready Player One just feels like a confusingly rushed film without much stake in the characters. The 80s nostalgia is nice, but feels forced and without a satisfying explanation as to why such historical references are important. One would think with the amount of source material available that this movie should have been separated into two parts, giving enough time to develop the story, include more important details, and insert as many pop culture references as the heart desires. In short, while not a bad film, Ready Player One is watchable, but leaves you wondering what could have been.","Ready Player One",1860,3.5,0.5
"1861",5,"  This movie was awesome. It might be 10 minutes, but you can't feel them. The visuals are spectacular, the story is fun and leaves us a good message. It was great. Absolutely great. I loved it, I will watch it at least once more before it drops from cinemas.","Ready Player One",1861,3.5,-1.5
"1862",5,"  My review is not 5 stars. It's 1 star. My 1 star review wasn't published, though. We will see it's published now that it's been changed to 5 stars. I haven't read the book, but I still thought this movie was awful. The plot does not make any sense, and nothing is believable in this movie. Nothing at all. The plot is so contrived it's almost difficult to follow. A narrator voice over has to tell the audience what's going on every few seconds for the first half of the movie. It reminded me of the Goonies if the Goonies was on the set of Mad Max of Thunderdome, except it was a lot worse than the Goonies. I never figured out what exactly motivated the villians. I never figured out what the glowing Easter Egg was supposed to represent, really, or what the interactive hologram was supposed to be, even when he was directly asked the question. Some will like the 70s and 80s references and vintage video games from the late 70s and early 80s, but it's not enough to make the movie.","Ready Player One",1862,3.5,-1.5
"1863",4,"  NÃO! O Spielberg não desaprendeu a fazer filmes aventurescos, divertidos, visualmente lindos e nostálgicos. Parabéns ao senhor Stevão que conseguiu pegar a obra do Ernest Cline e transformar em algo novo, (melhor?) e agradável. Seja pra um nerdão que viu o livro, até provavelmente pra alguém que nem curta tanto cultura pop e nunca leu uma palavra do texto de Cline. .","Ready Player One",1863,3.5,-0.5
"1864",5,"  Best movie I have seen in a very long time. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I would give this way more than a 76%","Ready Player One",1864,3.5,-1.5
"1865",4,"  Keeping this in a nutshell: Pretty standard ""orphan boy is so smart but is dumb about online dates but fixes said issues AND saves the world"" kind of thing. Supporting cast is a lot more interesting in the books, but the moments of surprise and awkward silence was cut off in favor of intense car chases and video game mass wars. 3DCG/video game visuals were top-notch and probably the reason why I'm here watching this dumb but fun flick and hoping to see my favorite characters appear in the digital world.

"1866",0.5,"  The first 15 minutes and about 30 seconds in the last big fight scene we're fairly enjoyable.... but the movie is 2 and a half ours long and felt like it could have ended 15 times, but it kept dragging on and on... Also the ""romance"" in the movie is forced and confusing...","Ready Player One",1866,3.5,3
"1867",5,"  Movie Buff, Gamer, Child Of The Eighties... This is for you!Okay so I loved the book and the movie does stray from the pages in print... But the essence, heart and nostalgia are all there! This is a great film and does the story and characters justice. It's not perfect but I will say the first thing I thought when the credits started rolling was, ""how soon can I watch it again!"" I will see it more then once in the theater.","Ready Player One",1867,3.5,-1.5
"1868",4,"  With a lot of pop culture references, most of them used in service of the plot, Ready Player One is Spielberg's love letter to pop culture and 80's references. Incredible action sequences and special effects but an overall lack of character development, RPO is a film that doesn't disappoint and doesn't get boring.","Ready Player One",1868,3.5,-0.5
"1869",4,"  I grew up in the 80's and LOVED the book. I realize some parts of a book like this won't translate well on a movie screen, or fit a in a 2hr film, but it seems Spielberg went out of his way to write a new story when the one in the book is so cleaver, creative and fun. Having said that I did enjoy the movie for what it was and give 4 stars. BTW, for anyone complaining about 'too many 80's references' those references are the whole point of the book. The author (and the creator of the OASIS) wanted younger people to learn about games, movies, shows and music from the 70's and 80's.","Ready Player One",1869,3.5,-0.5
"1870",3,"  It was okay and a passable film by all standards but the romance was way too forced, there was no exposition of who Artimis was, they made a ""resistance"". At the end I really have to say my main problem is that Artois was a Twitch streamer but not a blogger, and that she and Wade had little to no connection","Ready Player One",1870,3.5,0.5

"1873",5,"  Loved it. Not just the blizzard of cameos and Easter eggs, but the way the movie captured the spirit of the novel while being so divergent. In many ways these are two different stories. Or rather, two different tellings of the same story. I was born in '63 but spent most of my life in the '80s. This obviously allows me a nostalgic indulgence as an audience member. I spent a great deal of time going: Oh look Batman! Oh look the gun from Aliens! Hey, that's the original theme to Godzilla, etc. But that was not my complete experience with the movie. I was totally captured by the characters, their struggles and loves. As in the book, I wonder why Wade doesn't morn the death of Aunt more, but that is my ONLY negative feeling about this film. I hereby declare this an unofficial prequel to the Matrix! It was engaging, exciting and entertaining. Highly recommended.","Ready Player One",1873,3.5,-1.5

"1879",3.5,"  I really enjoyed this move! Many of the bad reviews seem to be from people who had read the book and were disappointed it was changed. Let me just say that I have never read the book and don't plan to. I am basing my review off seeing it as a non-fan of the book and a non gamer. I was impressed by the story line. I thought it would be lots of explosions and over the top CGI, but the story was actually interesting, and the games the y created were very unique. There are some edge of your seat moments that I really enjoyed.However, there are some problems. This story is very male-centric. The female cast is just there as secondary support characters or love interest, and now that I think of it, so were the minority characters. This was so shameless that it actually felt WEIRD, given that most movies these days are doing a better job at not only token diversity, but actually making underrepresented people the leads rather than side supporting cast. I mean Star Trek and Star Wars are known for envisioning a future in which diversity is just commonplace, so the fact that this took place in the near future and it lacked prominent minority leads, literally felt hard-believe. I've read similar criticism from other viewers so it's not just me. Other than that. It was a fun film, The SHAMELESS emphasis on the white male gamer though is a bit hard to stomach, though, if you don't happen to be a white male gamer.","Ready Player One",1879,3.5,0
"1880",5,"  Very well adapted from the one of the best geek book. It does have a bunch of changes but most (if not all) of them is done just right.","Ready Player One",1880,3.5,-1.5
"1881",3,"  VIDEO KILLED THE MOVIE STAR - My Review of READY PLAYER ONE (3 Stars)I didn't grow up on video games. An occasional round of Ms. Pac Man was about as far as I wanted to indulge. I much preferred allowing a strong director guide me through a film story rather than trusting my own instincts and limited knob control skills with a game. One of those directors I'd follow anywhere was/is Steven Spielberg. Love him or hate him, there's no denying he's a Great American Showman with a keen knack for making sure his audience is invested enough in his main characters to follow them on their sometimes epic journeys. His latest, which comes fresh off the heels of the decidedly more adult THE POST, has wonderful sweep and many pleasures, but aims squarely for the gamers and 80s nostalgia buffs out there. I loved the 80s, with its magical explosion of power pop songs, music videos, and multiplexes filled with one great teen comedy after another. Sure, we had Reagan, the onset of AIDS, and oppressive regimes committing atrocities without the internet's ability to expose them with a well-placed Tweet, but as far as pop culture was concerned, it was pretty special. READY PLAYER ONE, co-written by its novelist, Ernest Cline and Zak Penn, fills every frame with 80s references when its not emulating an immersive, virtual reality video game. While fun and light, it wore out its welcome with me due to a bloated 2 hour, 20 minute running time and a fairly confused message. It's 2045, and our hero, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan of MUD), lives in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic Columbus, Ohio. After a series of wars and shortages, most people live in squalor in RVs stacked high on top of each other (called The Stacks). With such miserable living conditions, their only escape is to strap on VR goggles and enter the ""Oasis"", where life resembles the unlimited imagination of an ever-expanding game. In addition its endless pleasures lies planets filled with war and terror, but it's all make believe. The big drawback is that a giant corporation controls the Oasis, and its players can either collect or lose coins, the latter resulting in imprisonment, enslavement, or worse. Bottom line: The world is addicted to the game and are willing to take the risks it presents. When James Halliday, one of the founders of the Oasis dies (a terrific performance by Speilberg's lucky charm, Mark Rylance), he leaves behind a video message ceding ownership of his baby and trillions of dollars if a player can locate three keys hidden somewhere in the game. Along with a slew of individuals competing for this great prize, an evil corporation forces its minions to vie for the prize. It's the 99 percenters like Wade and his Merry Band of Misfits versus the 1% as the great race begins. Unlike so many of its fantasy-driver counterparts...I see you VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS!...READY PLAYER ONE lays out its premise rather flawlessly. Despite its overstuffed imagery, it's an easy film to follow, thanks to its screenwriters and Spielberg's career-long insistence on clean storytelling. Unfortunately, we spend so much time inside the Oasis, an entirely animated world where our main characters get replaced by CGI avatars. As such, we don't get to see very much of Sheridan or his scrappy cohort/love interest played by Olivia Cooke (ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL) in the flesh. Sure, their avatars defy gravity at times and bounce deliriously through the many well-staged chase sequences, but there's a human connection missing at times. I kept wishing the avatars looked just like the actors so that we could get more of their performances. If Keanu Reeves can enter THE MATRIX intact, so could they! That's not to say that the Oasis is without its fun. This film contains so many Easter Eggs in the form of movie and music references from the 80s, including a funny but not for children sequence inside one of the most influential horror movies of all time. We also get Freddie Krueger, Beetlejuice, Aliens, and Chucky to namecheck along the way. I may want to see it again just to spot the references. Also, TJ Miller (late of SILICON VALLEY) does great voice work as does Lena Waithe (MASTER OF NONE), but, call me crazy, I would have invested more in this story had I been able to watch more human faces. Hell, Ben Mendelsohn, as an evil corporate villain, has an avatar that looks just like him, so why can't everyone else have that luxury?My biggest problem with the film, however, is that for a story with a message that we need to put down our computers and phones once in a while to enjoy the reality in front of us, it spends a disproportionate amount of time in the VR sector trying to entertain and thrill us. The marketing sucks us in with its promise of non-stop virtual action...and the film does this so, so well...but then it pulls the rug out from under us to sell us on a different, opposing message. Spielberg seems to want to have his pixelated cake and eat it too! As such, I left the film somewhat confused. With its I LOVE THE 80s soundtrack, I'm not complaining that Van Halen's ""Jump"" found its way in there, but as a non-gamer, I was exhausted. I wanted to go home afterward, curl up into a ball and watch two people talking MY DINNER WITH ANDRE-style to cleanse myself of the audio and video assault I had just witnessed.","Ready Player One",1881,3.5,0.5

"1885",5,"  A really good movie, I loved the nostalgia and got every cultural reference. It was very enjoyable!!","Ready Player One",1885,3.5,-1.5
"1886",5,"  Excellent adaptation of an amazing novel. It's easy for critics of a certain age to try and minimize the film to an 80s nostalgia flick, but my 9 and 14 year olds loved every second - demanding to see it 2X in the opening weekend. It is a thrilling action film with great takes on classic and current memes, games, songs, movies and more. It also is a great morality tale. My only regret is that the two main characters weren't quite the antisocial nerds that I wanted, more more like the attractive person who puts on glasses (or a port wine birthmark) to be ""ugly""","Ready Player One",1886,3.5,-1.5
"1887",3.5,"  It's a mess, but it's a good mess. What else do you really expect?","Ready Player One",1887,3.5,0
"1888",4,"  This movie was amazing in my opinion, I really liked the plot and I had a blast watching this on my birthday. the movie had a few bad things in it but you don't really pay attention to it because the movie is really interesting, if I had to grade this movie, i'd probably give it an A-.","Ready Player One",1888,3.5,-0.5
"1889",2.5,"  After reading Ernest Cline's novel, I felt ""Ready Player One"" could make a good movie. Yes, I know that there would be considerable changes from the source material as is commonplace, but I was optimistic the movie could work. My optimism was misplaced. This movie is not terrible, but I just found it dull despite all the scenes that are built on adrenaline and supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. This story seemed all too familiar. Again we get the David vs. Goliath story and David won in the end (Yawn.). The changes here from the novel don't work. One thing I will say in the movie's favor is that it tries to keep the basic theme of Ernest Cline's novel that as fun as fantasy is, reality is better mainly because it is real and that obsession is actually a bad thing that can lead to tragedy. Two of Spielberg's last three films have been duds. Let's hope he gets out of this rut soon.","Ready Player One",1889,3.5,1
"1890",3,"  There is no denying Ready Player One is an entertaining movie full of Spielberg magic that reminds you of all of the Spielberg movies you loved as a kid. However, having read the book I can't help wishing Spielberg had made a closer adaptation to the book. The book for me was pure fanboy magic mixed with superb 80's nostalgia. The film glosses over a lot of the cultural references, perhaps with the intention of making it a little more relatable to a younger audience who perhaps won't get all of the obscure 80's references. The way characters meet happens somewhat differently which changes relationship dynamics plus there is a whole added rebellion subplot which never occurred in the book. Also Simon Pegg's character of Ogden Morrow has a significantly reduced role in the film compared to the book which is a shame because his character has a big influence on the finale. It was always going to be a difficult one to adapt considering the story, I reckon if anyone was going to make a decent stab at it then it would be Spielberg.","Ready Player One",1890,3.5,0.5
"1891",2,"  Worst book adaptation ever.","Ready Player One",1891,3.5,1.5
"1892",4,"  Sure, there are things I would have liked to see done differently (follow the book a little more closely, give it a global scale, nerdier cast)....but, what fun! Many laugh out moments, smiles, and the audience gave it a round of applause at the theater I was in. The search for the second easter egg and the performance of Mark Ryland (who played Halliday) were the bright spots for me. Also, it took awhile, but somewhere halfway through the movie, it hit me....yeah, this is Spielberg...and thats not a bad thing.","Ready Player One",1892,3.5,-0.5
"1893",4,"  Awesome movie, but it glosses over plot problems and is too simplistic at some points in a very detailed world, but it's still awesome.","Ready Player One",1893,3.5,-0.5
"1894",4,"  A fanboy knows a hater...when he sees one!","Ready Player One",1894,3.5,-0.5
"1895",0.5,"  Worst movie I've ever seen. If you have any love for the book don't see this movie and save yourself the anger and heartache. Everything that made the book fun and interesting is not in the movie. It almost doesn't even follow the same story. Absolute garbage literally the only thing they had from the book that made it in the movie is character names and the hunt for the egg.","Ready Player One",1895,3.5,3
"1896",1,"  Erased from the story for this movie was climate changed ravaged Earth, peak oil energy crisis and small Wars over the remaining resources. The movie blames Oasis addiction for the neglect of earth and its' problems.","Ready Player One",1896,3.5,2.5
"1897",5,"  This movie was fantastic! Differently appeals to all ages, seeing the iron giant back in action was a childhood dream. Their were a few things I though they could speed up but in my opinion this movie was pretty good...","Ready Player One",1897,3.5,-1.5
"1898",4.5,"  The movie was great. I really enjoyed the plot and acting. The cgi was pretty phenomenal. The only issue I have it the writing at times was a little cringy, but other than that it was a great move.","Ready Player One",1898,3.5,-1
"1899",5,"  Loved it. Its a lot different from the book, But all the elements are there, and a lot of the Books Things that are missing from the story have been put in As Easter eggs. The story works really Well on screen in Its rewritten form, and luckily Its the author of the book Ernest Clone that have works on the script.

"1902",5,"  If you're a gamer if you watch anime if you are a NERD for god sake GO SEE THIS MOVIE","Ready Player One",1902,3.5,-1.5
"1903",3,"  Despite being visually striking, Ready Player One offers little interest for those looking for a good story. Set in a distant and dark future where people are obsessed with a virtual world called OASIS, the film follows the story of a teenager called Wade who, like the rest of the players, is looking for three hidden keys in order to find an easter egg and gain control of the place. In fact, the whole movie is an easter egg on its own. On the one hand, it is really engaging to catch all the cameos and little references that are hidden across the film, thus allowing for multiple viewings. On the other hand, it may be somewhat overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with videogames, and who will miss some of the fun. The script is extremely predictable and boring, although that shouldn't be a surprise since Ernest Cline's book was poorly written as well. However, I have to recognize that some parts are simply outstanding. One of them was already shown in the trailers (the race sequence). The other is related to one of the best movies of the eighties, but i won't spoil you anything else. The actors do a fine job, but they aren't given enough time to shine, since we spend most of the time with their avatars in the Oasis. In fact, I found it very hard to connect with them. To sum up, I think RPO is Spielberg's weakest flick since The Terminal, but it's still worth watching on the big screen.","Ready Player One",1903,3.5,0.5
"1904",1,"  So disappointing. The nostalgia from the book is barely seen in the film. And the movie is a completely different story than the book. Perhaps the movie with a different title would make this film watchable. But it's a tragedy to those whom loved the book.","Ready Player One",1904,3.5,2.5
"1905",2,"  Good for eye candy visuals but that's about it. Relies on nostalgia and references rather than a plot that keeps you caring. Drags up emotions by showing you things you already like.","Ready Player One",1905,3.5,1.5
"1906",1.5,"  If you are a fan of the book do not see this movie. Its like Spielberg just glanced at the Cliff notes (and not very well) and made the movie with a bunch of yes men. Hardly catches the spirit of the movie. More like the idea of the movie. If you did watch the move and thought it was good, then listen to the narrated version of the book by Will Wheaton for something great.","Ready Player One",1906,3.5,2
"1907",2.5,"  I big disappointment after reading the book twice. The movie doesn't follow book's plot at all. I give 2.5 stars because animation is good.","Ready Player One",1907,3.5,1

"1910",5,"  If there's one thing I've learned while watching READY PLAYER ONE, it's that even if you're having fun, you can always count on those that support you. This movie was an absolute blast. I literally enjoyed every single minute of it from beginning to end. The special effects were first rate, the story was top notch, and there were so many cool moments that will make you feel excited, happy, and emotional. With so many great moments that will take you beyond the limits, READY PLAYER ONE is a story that no one can deny, even if you want to keep playing the game and continue to have a good time.","Ready Player One",1910,3.5,-1.5
"1911",5,"  The fact this ONLY has a 76% critic rating and a 79% audience rating (at the time of writing this) is an absolute travesty. This has to be one of the GREATEST films EVER MADE - it is PURE AWESOMENESS!","Ready Player One",1911,3.5,-1.5
"1912",3,"  Visually dazzling and well performed and directed, but it just fails to do anything remarkable to set it apart from the onslaught of superhero/scifi/action films we've been subjected to in the last 10 years. I had more fun trying to pick out the easter eggs than I did being engaged in the fates of the characters, though the sequence in the Overlook Hotel from The Shining is nothing short of brilliant.","Ready Player One",1912,3.5,0.5
"1913",4,"  Drastically different from its source material, but still makes an interesting story for fans of the book to enjoy.","Ready Player One",1913,3.5,-0.5
"1914",0.5,"  If you LIKED the book, you may walk out of the moving within 15 minutes. Seriously. This is certainly one of the WORST book adaptation by Hollywood / Spielberg to date. There are dozens of inconsistencies with the book that materially water down the movie. The book had some very harsh realities in it, driven by a society dependent on VR to get rid of its woes. This book doesn't go anywhere near the tough topics in the book. Several story sub plot lines are not present in the book, either, which could be dealt with on with very small changes to the story. There are several topics out of order, and several major movie elements that are in contrast to the book and substantively change the plot and character dynamics. About the only thing that they got right - is Aech. That character's IRL actor was excellent.","Ready Player One",1914,3.5,3

"1918",4,"  Sure, it's not very heavy on character development, and it's close to nothing like the book, but it's undeniably one of the most fun movies one can see. This is definitely a popcorn movie.","Ready Player One",1918,3.5,-0.5
"1919",5,"  Ready Player One is an absolute visual feast which maintains the cinematic experience between visual world and the real world. It's an amazing movie, I highly recommend it.","Ready Player One",1919,3.5,-1.5
"1920",1.5,"  Very disappointing that it didn't follow the book. I don't care if it takes three movies to do so... really was looking forward to see the main character go from overweight to fit - then go hack IOI - none of that happened. And the line, ""You killed my mom's sister!"" - who says that? I can't.","Ready Player One",1920,3.5,2
"1921",5,"  Wow! Awesome story, awesome visual effects, and great acting. This is definitely one for your video library when it comes out. It has something for everyone- young and old, tech savvy and tech challenged.","Ready Player One",1921,3.5,-1.5
"1922",3.5,"  3.75/5 starsFirst off, they changed a bunch of the plot in pretty significant ways. So, if you read the book be prepared for that. The book is way more nuanced and deeper. Second, the movie doesn't have anything close to the 80's nostalgia as the book (which was really part of what made the book so enjoyable).But with both of those things aside, the movie was fun and the world of Oasis (which probably took up half the movie) was really done spectacularly well. It reminded me a bit of when Avatar came out and thinking about how well they created a whole new world. There are a couple of really fantastic bit characters. Both Iroc and Halliday are really well done. And most of the other characters are done pretty well.There are a few points when the movie dragged on a bit, but overall, I really enjoyed it.","Ready Player One",1922,3.5,0
"1923",5,"  If you happened to read the book, this was a great adaptation to the big screen which isn't usually the case. Excellent casting and special effects. Loved every minute!","Ready Player One",1923,3.5,-1.5
"1924",3.5,"  In another's filmmaker hands, Ready Player One could've been a masterpiece, a cunning satire about detachment and the future of virtual reality. Under Spielberg's direction, we embark in a fun, meticulously crafted, old-school love letter to pop culture and it's nostalgic power. This is to say, vintage Spielberg. In the '80s, the filmmaker sold the '40s; now, he took advantage of a seemingly unclosable cultural wormhole and delved into everything '80s, from beloved classic games and films to one too many Duran Duran references. But does it work? Every now and then. When it's firing on all cylinders, Ready Player One becomes an engaging experience, a fever dream grounded by a desire to transcend the medium. As a whole, however, the film never quite finds its center. Spielberg's visual extravaganza is held back by its own humility and the inability to make strong, unpredictable decisions. In truth, it spends too much real estate with member berries, and servicing a beat-by-beat Save the Cat narrative. Fortunately, Tye Sheridan, Lena Waithe, and Olivia Cooke make for a compelling watch, a trio of up-and-coming performers that surpass what's on the page. It's perhaps a missed opportunity that a story about finding our place in the (virtual) world doesn't translate into more than a forgettable and harmless crowd pleaser. But then again, maybe we should just lean on the film's message: enjoy the momentary escape and then focus on what really matters, the world around you.","Ready Player One",1924,3.5,0
"1925",4,"  Unless you are familiar with what has been happening on the gaming and movie scene for the past 30-40 years, a lot of the stuff happening in the movie will go straight over your head and you won't get the full experience of this flick. Still, Spielberg has managed to make it interesting for those unfamiliar with the buckets and loads of pop cultural references. Most of the movie takes place inside a virtual environment called OASIS, where most people are spending their time since the real world has collapsed in more than one way and people seek to escape their miserably lives. In the OASIS, people can do and be whatever they want to be. The rich creator of OASIS, Halliday, has been dead for few years. Inside his game he has hidden an Easter egg. The one to find it gets to inherit his company, his creation OASIS and his massive fortune. To find the egg Halliday has built in a quest, where whoever wants the egg needs to find 3 keys. And to get to the keys, the ones searching for the egg must obtain vast knowledge about significant pop culture of the 80s and 90s as well as knowledge about Halliday himself.This is the premise of the movie and the fight for the egg, the OASIS and all that money stands between our protagonist, Wade Watts (who first starts out on this quest to become rich, but later finds a less selfish reason to search for the egg), and a huge corporation called IOI, who seeks to monetize the virtual world and will stop at nothing to obtain it.For those who has read the book prior to the movie, this movie will initially feel like a bit of a letdown as a lot of the references made to recent pop culture in the book as well as certain events has been left out or altered. It goes without saying that you can't cram 10 hours worth of material into a 2-hour movie. But Spielberg somehow manages to stay true to the book while creating new scenes that are still in the spirit of the book and thus creates an experience that will be fresh to the readers. Whether you then like that or not, that's for your individual mind to decide.I for one love the book and I love the movie as well, although a part of me is a bit sad that all the copyright issues stood in the way of making it possible to stay more true to the book, but hey... Spielberg, Kal Penn and Ernest still has made a kick-ass adaption with what they had to work with. It might not become a classic in this age of binge watching, where movies and shows have almost become ""disposable"" products and are not reverred the same way as those movies it so endearingly makes references to, but it is definitely a love letter to those blockbusters of yesteryears and will surely find a place in hearts of both nostalgics and movie buffs alike.","Ready Player One",1925,3.5,-0.5

"1928",0.5,"  After telling my 15 year old son, who hate to read, that if he read the book first, we would go see Ready Player One, he cracked open that book and read every page in less than 3 days! I had already read the book so we were both EXCITED to see the movie. We took my 20 year old that did not read the book with us.This movie was so far from the book that my son and I wanted to walk out 1/2 way through the movie! My 20 year said it had nice graphics but was an ""Okay"" movie. We sat through this horrible adaptation ONLY because I paid a TON of money to see it at the theater on opening weekend. And opening weekend in Oklahoma city, as anyone who read the book knows, lead to long lines.HE MUTILATED THE BOOK! took names of characters and the basic theme of the movie to make a Hodge-Podge pile of dung. To MUCH CGI to really develop any characters, skipped over too much of the story lines and adversities that the characters faced, changed all but the final challenge. Overall, it was a mess!At the end of the movie, there were a few teens that clapped but even then the muttering and grumbling in the theater silenced the claps quickly. As we walked out alongside others who could not leave fast enough, I heard the same thing. It was AWFUL!Seriously, don't make the same mistake that we did... Wait til it comes out on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or better yet, Pirate Bay! Not worth the money or time. I wouldn't even get it from Red-box!I cannot believe that Cline would sign off on such a huge detour from the book. I have a feeling that Cline is going to feel the same way bout this book Vs. movie as Stephen King felt about ""the Shining"" book vs. movie. Shame on you Spielberg... shame on you!","Ready Player One",1928,3.5,3
"1929",0.5,"  Even if you have no idea about the book this is based on, this movie is complete garbage. It panders to lowest common denominator humor, This film suffers from the petty to pretentious and is littered with plot holes. For instance, the two main characters, Parzival and Art3mis, share a 'witty' banter early on in the film where they show off their unyeilding knowledge of James Halliday, creator of the Oasis. A few ""omg do you love my references! Let me shove five more in your face and be super obvious about it!"" scenes later they are doing research on Halliday. That is not a surprise, but Art3mis is wholly shocked to find out that Halliday had gone on a date in his life.. if these people know Halliday's favorite GoldenEye character then this really shouldn't be such an unknown.This movie is so terrible it makes me want to re-elect Trump","Ready Player One",1929,3.5,3

"1936",4.5,"  A great movie, one of my favorite MCU films to date. I was able to predict some of the twists, though that could be in part cause it is a superhero movie. I defiantly look forward to seeing Black Panther in future MCU films.","Black Panther",1936,4.1,-0.4

"1942",5,"  Impossible to speak of ""Black Panther"" without hitting the key (and with all right) of the representativeness, the importance of this film for a part of the population that few times was protagonist .. represented of heroic form.Finally, the film raises these discussions but treated as just another part of the already extensive MCU, the film fits and excels in Ryan Coogler's sharp technique in the quick and didactic story set in a unique moment in American history the only one that defines the entire line of the film, the quest for tactile reality ... even though it is primarily a fantasy of Marvel superheroes. That has all his way of being, winner .. but here Ryan gets more polarized the jokes are punctual quick .. many comes from the relationship Shuri and T'challa in this brother thing. The movie has this sort of thing ""lion king"", loss of the father..the rise means the forceps of a new king..meio that without knowing the way forward before the challenges faced by this Wakanda..so rich and technological .. but closed to the world for so long. The other side of the coin that ambitions the throne Erik Killmonger, has different plans for this nation in dispute. A young man with thirst for revenge who does not hesitate to achieve his goals, with fury and savagery does not measure efforts in the ends that he believes justify the means. Villain, fanatic, terrorist ... he may be all these things ... but the origin of the young person who does not justify his actions ... is a considerable motor force ... he has the motivation the reason to be so. And Michael B. Jordan manages to convey this in every scene in every angry speech, every act of Killmonger ... sympathy would not say, but you almost understand your motives. The movie walks true, beautiful .. you look at Wakanda and see her pretty colorful, organic and technological .. something that could have been .. happened if they had the chance, if they had the power over themselves. You look at that look and smile if you imagine it there. The cast is also impressed by the commitment to truthfulness by the transmission of feeling, placed in each expression. I think from the moment that film could reach so many people, so many lives they wanted their performances to reflect on those lives. The importance of this film, perhaps in the history of the cinema so rich is small, but with whom he intends to speak and whoever is willing to listen to it will be very important and represent a lot. The politics embedded in it shows current..the conflicts shown..the fears and intolerances treated to a lesser or greater degree, are sharp and speak with this generation. Black Panther was created in the 60s / 70s, a time of racial tension, a black panthers group, and even today it is necessary and punctual. Preaching diversity, respect for the different and unity as if we were all part of a beautiful and numerous tribe.","Black Panther",1942,4.1,-0.9
"1943",4,"  This movie was amazing. Mostly, Michael B. Jordan's performance as Killmonger. There was a lot of depth to him. He truly felt that he was the hero of the story. They don't make villains like that for every movie, but the ones that do are wonderful stories. Go see this movie. Not only is it a great addition to the MCU, but it shows that heroes are not perfect and villains are not always inherently evil.","Black Panther",1943,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"1944",5,"  Action movies aren't really my thing, but I ended up really enjoying Black Panther anyway. I loved learning about Wakanda and its culture. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed myself this much with a movie!","Black Panther",1944,4.1,-0.9

"1947",2,"  No real humor, its way more serious then it really needs to be. I came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and subtle political messages hidden for me to find upon repeated viewings. Although it was over hyped and even if it was amazing it still would have been over hyped, but the hype did have a part in me thinking it would be the most incredible movie you ever did see. So my point is, they sacrificed humor for politics and yet i still dont get exactly what political message they were trying to tell even after 4 repeated viewings. Libral? Conservative? in between? I dont know, yet they sacrificed my main drive, humor, for politics i dont even understand.","Black Panther",1947,4.1,2.1

"1949",2,"  was excited to watch this with all the hype. I found it to be my least favorite Marvel movie. The poor African accents made it painful. It was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from Marvel.","Black Panther",1949,4.1,2.1
"1950",3,"  I know this isn't a popular statement - but in my opinion, Black Panther is only slightly above average, mainly due to its predictability. I wouldn't count it among the top Marvel movies, though definitely better than most of the depressing DC movies of late (Except Wonder Woman ofcourse).With the overdose of Superhero movies nowadays, its hard for us to be impressed lately. Marvel/Disney are smart to release this in Feb - a traditionally lull movie month, so this is clearly the top earner. Also, its ahead of the upcoming big guns in Summer.","Black Panther",1950,4.1,1.1
"1951",3.5,"  Reviewed 3.18.18. Black Panther has deservedly received a lot of press for its first of a kind casting for a superhero movie. And also for raking in a ton of dough. So the fact that it's the most nuanced of all the Marvel movies has flown under the radar. The blurred line between right and wrong has been mined to death in the comic book genre. But no other entry has so adeptly deconstructed the greater truth. Along with the topical storyline of nativism versus world building, Black Panther is the 'now' movie of the moment. Brave enough to make the antagonist the most compelling character, young director/writer Ryan Coogler sets himself apart. With Marvel perhaps running out of steam (and enough darn CGI already, it's a comic book movie, not a cartoon), Black Panther has raised the bar perhaps one final notch.","Black Panther",1951,4.1,0.6

"1960",5,"  Fantastic! It gets so much right it's almost unheard of. Every member of the cast shines like a gem. The world and characters are so rich and vibrant it feels like everyone and everything you see is as real and has as much history behind them as anything on our side of the silver screen. Even the villain is a robust and three-dimensional character who holds views the audience is likely to sympathize with, though he takes them to an unacceptable extreme. If you haven't seen this yet, go. Go see it. See why it's about to top a billion in sales less than a month from opening.","Black Panther",1960,4.1,-0.9
"1961",3.5,"  I have been disappointed by a number of movies recently, which on a viewing do not live up to their hype. So, I went into Black Panther waiting to be disappointed and happily on this occasion I wasn't. To balance this, it's not the masterpiece that some critics have made of it but it is an enjoyable watch. The action pieces are great, the plot solid and though the characters don't match those of other Marvel entries, they are still likeable and do not fall into the trap of being overly clichéd. The dialogue doesn't sizzle like other Marvel movies but it certainly isn't cringe worthy and perfectly fits the story they are trying to portray. The plot works well for the characters and world that the movie is trying to create and while not overly inventive, it is still a good watch. Overall, I am glad that I went to see this and hopefully they can keep the quality going.","Black Panther",1961,4.1,0.6
"1962",3.5,"  gREAT Superhero movie with An incredibly relevant and Potent Message and themes on race and equality. I just wouldn't call it %97 worthy, due to Fairly cliche structure and a Huge disappointment on behalf of the soundtrack, which BASICALLY just recycles trap beats and features almost no Kendrick Lamar throughout the entire RUN-TIME of the film, despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film's official soundtrack. The pros outweigh the cons for sure, but it's by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying.","Black Panther",1962,4.1,0.6

Everything in this film just soars: The cast, direction, visuals, soundtrack, message, etc. If any superhero film deserves a ton of Oscar nods it's this one. Marvel Studios continues their unbreakable hot-streak and prove that they can make truly important films in addition to ridiculously fun ones.","Black Panther",1966,4.1,-0.9
"1967",3.5,"  Good movie; great choreography, fight sequences; magical visual FX, lots of gadgets (feels like #JamesBond); #Wakanda was well introduced; good villains, you can understand their motivations; good plot, drama, politic, but.... the film is decaf, without something really EPIC; Sometimes is slow.","Black Panther",1967,4.1,0.6

"1969",2.5,"  Visually a masterpiece, amazing costume design, CGI brings this comic book character to life with amazing imagery. Chadwick Boseman nails it as the central character Black Panther. The character must share ample time with green screen and other major battle scenes with Michael B. Jordan as Erick Killmonger his main rival.Wakanda is the home for T'Challa son of the slain king T'Chaka, who must take his rightful place leading his country. The council is a tribal group who advises and provides the backdrop to ensure the country remains strong.The areas where there is a certain amount of leverage in any comic book movies is the dialogue. At times I had trouble understanding what was being said. It also seemed to show the same close ups of the tribal council over and over as well as the ritual to become the Black Panther. It was tedious to watch and seemed like it was unnecessary. The action sequences made this worth the wait as the loyal Wakanda people battled the other factions led by Erik Killmonger changes the landscape to change the Vibrairum rich Wakanda to move to the entire world and kill all those who oppose.In summary great action movie with great scenery and a wonderful cast. Was it the best super hero movie no but am looking forward to the next. Keep pushing the envelope.","Black Panther",1969,4.1,1.6

Boring, predictable plot combined with atrocious acting and dripping with transparent, tired and boring US-centric racial themes make this movie one to miss. Honestly, what has happened to Hollywood?

"2001",4,"  As Marvel films go, this is not bad and satisfactorily introduces a new character for future enrollment to the ""Avengers"" franchise. The special effects were excellent. The Black Panther's suit and the fantasy technology generally was served justice. The back story of the character laboured a bit, making it slow progress initially but it picks up on the action front. A few political elements crept in but I'll leave that for others to make their own minds up on. As a stand alone movie, not bad at all, with solid performances but outside of the Black Panther joining the Avengers, I don't know if I'd go for another installment with this character as the main subject. Still, Stan Lee must be proud.","Black Panther",2001,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2002",5,"  Definitely the best MCU film so far! T'Challa is a powerful and complex character, unlike any other we have seen so far. The visuals and the Wakandan technology and culture were fantastic. Killmonger was a strong and relatable character for whom I felt real empathy. His motives were excellent. It was his methods that made him the bad guy. Best and most complex MCU villain so far.","Black Panther",2002,4.1,-0.9

"2004",2.5,"  Though the message they wanted to bring across was noble. The movie itself was a bland mix of Dynasty TV drama, Lion King, and Casino Royale with unfinished looking/poorly done CGI, Mission Impossible wannabe (lack of) action, led by a wooden title character. The only convincing acting was the disposable main villain who hardly appeared. Too many boxes on their list to check, yet none of the ticks hit their target. The costumes were beautiful though.","Black Panther",2004,4.1,1.6

"2014",4,"  Very much worth seeing but not memorable or inspiring. Solid superhero story full of superior actors, brilliant special effects, good editing, and decent writing. Some minor mis-casting, some confusing messaging, and some poor dialogue detract from elevating this movie to greatness.","Black Panther",2014,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2015",5,"  High quality action scenes, well acted and well written. Throw in an on point sound track to pace the movie. True to the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs. Strong performance from Micheal B. Jordan as the antagonist really pushes Chadwick Boseman protagonist character to be even better. Great casting of women actors as strong characters with a variety of characteristics makes this another strong entry in the Marvel Universe. The story in Wakanda sets up nicely the coming of Marvel's mega team up movie Infinity Wars...!","Black Panther",2015,4.1,-0.9
"2016",5,"  Casting, Directing, Music , Cinematography everything about this movie marks it as one of the best MCU movies ever made. But on top of that rich depth of its characters and a story line that could be outside of the MCU makes this one of the best movies made period.","Black Panther",2016,4.1,-0.9
"2017",5,"  I want to watch Black Panther again but after a day reflecting on the film, I'd say it's one of the best of the MCU and of superhero films in general. You get what you want like people fighting each other (and really well done one on one combat) but a lot of the great weight of the film that stands out is the excellent score and strong writing for it's cast of characters and their moments. Every character is a realized one and has an essential role and function that makes sense for the story. Also this movie proves you can have a heroic and strong main character and also have strong supporting characters - many of whom are women - who are equal to the hero without tearing down the hero. Black Panther is strong as the Black Panther sure but Okoye, Nakia, Shuri, even Agent Ross all felt like they played an essential part in helping Black Panther suceed and save the day by each having strengths that BP just doesn't have.Also Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains which is saying something since (contrary to what clickbait articles will lead you to believe) Marvel has many great antagonists. Ultron, Loki, Kilgrave, Nebula, Ego, but Killgrave differed by going a route with his character and motivations that I'm sure no other film studio has the stones to address. The movie addresses race and the repurcussions of history and how it affects the present and how people of the present all are figuring out what to do to move forward towards the future and the answer isn't so simple either leading to many of the characters beyond just Black Panther learning and growing over the course of the movie.Oh and aside from the last credits scene, Black Panther is simply a contained Marvel movie. It's not trying to set up Infinity War or focused on the wider universe - it focuses squarely on Wakanda and it's characters and while ultimately what happens in Wakanda could have a bigger impact on the planet, when watching the film the characters are so good and so well written and realized that you completely forget about Iron Man and the Avengers who are also on the same planet. They don't matter really which is kind of a breath of fresh air.The movie was like Game of Thrones in it's approach to politics as King T'Challa is the ruler of Wakanda and Wakanda itself is kind of a character. The film is about just how this country will carry on towards the future and what it will do about it's past as Black Panther and his allies and even enemies are at a crossroads at what to do. It's a damn good film.","Black Panther",2017,4.1,-0.9

"2021",3.5,"  Black Panther (review) (nonspoiler)With the 18th installment of The MCU, The world of Wakanda is introduced in its glorious form after years of being teased since its first tease in Iron Man 2. The production of the film in regards to its visuals and aesthetics are truly breathtaking and deserve award nominations already. Costume designs and cinematography deserve high marks. I just wish the story itself was on the same breathtaking level. The plot and structure itself was predictable from my own point of view.The incredible performance by the cast helped bring the film's basic story to life which I found at times leaned into narrative cliches that are typical in the genre. The score was ok although nothing stuck out which is why the score is really an afterthought. The film's 1st act is a bit slow which hampers the film slightly. The second act was paced very well. The third act felt rushed which is typical of comic book films. The CGI at times was questionable,This is very apparent when seen in the third act. Overall, BlackPanther is a solid film released at the right time.My rating: 3.9 out of 5 ??","Black Panther",2021,4.1,0.6
"2022",3,"  The visual effects were often subpar to the Marvel standard and were even irritatingly bad at points, the main character was not as interesting as his bodyguard, and the world building was poorly thought out. Why does the most technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears? or live in giant cities with dirt roads and thatch roofs? Not enough care was put into the details of the film, despite moderately good characters and some exceptional performances from the actors.","Black Panther",2022,4.1,1.1
"2023",1,"  Featured zero actual black panthers. Way too much CGI and a mediocre script.","Black Panther",2023,4.1,3.1
"2024",3,"  moST OVERRATED MOVIE SO FAR In 2018, terrible cgi, wooden acting from the main villain, cardboard characters used as extras, i seem this film was rushed, i give it 6/10","Black Panther",2024,4.1,1.1

"2027",5,"  Good stand alone Marvel movie with lots of action!","Black Panther",2027,4.1,-0.9
"2028",3,"  It's evidently just me, but I didn't like Black Panther. Boring, disjointed, and afraid to step out of his comfort zone, the movie just stumbles along without developing characters, providing laughs, or action. The movie plays out as if it's terrified of being good. Now, this is not to say it's a terrible movie...just boring. There's some messaging in their, but even that was steam cleaned before release. When a movie is based around a single concept but then dilutes it to prevent offending it's audience you're left with a 2 hour ""The more you know"" PSA. The cast was better then the script, and the source material better then the movie, but it couldn't break free of the weight of it's own hubris.","Black Panther",2028,4.1,1.1
"2029",4.5,"  Black Panther easily surpasses most Marvel movies of the past. The storytelling and the pacing of the movie are well done, and Michael B. Jordan as Eric Killmonger is hands-down the best villain the Marvel Cinematic Universe has shown on screen. Yet again, Chadwick Boseman puts on another great performance as the king of Wakanda, both in his emotion towards scenes in the movie, and in the fighting choreography. I thought, however, that the Soul Stone not being shown in the movie is a bit of a letdown, although I believe that the existence of the Soul Stone is shown in a clever way by Ryan Coogler, which in his first outing as a Marvel director, was quite clearly his best. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to all Marvel fans, both old and new.","Black Panther",2029,4.1,-0.4
"2030",3,"  Black Panther is a sort of unique movie that dosent give me much of a ""marvel"" feel, but otherwise it has a good plot, emotional sometimes, and just everything about Wakanda is just perfect. The city has a good concept and it plays out well throughout the movie. T'Challa's history and his family's was interesting to hear too. This is a good marvel movie, but I'm more into the next avengers one","Black Panther",2030,4.1,1.1
"2031",2,"  Don't, Don't Don't Believe the hype!An Average movie at best! Black Panther Superhero? Seems to have no real powers without his purple juice & suit. It's like being Batman or Iron man but getting your sister to do all the clever stuff. Without his Grape juice, he loses fights & barely wins with normal guys. With his grape juice he still almost loses. I wanted & hoped for so much more from this movie. Making tons of money & having lots of hype doesn't make it a great movie. As a superhero movie, ignoring race completely it's at best average.","Black Panther",2031,4.1,2.1
"2032",2,"  I'm sorry but this movie is NOT a good movie. Marvel's Avengers and Wonder Woman are far better than this piece of crap. The story is b e y o n d b o r i n g and there is like one cool car scene. I am so glad I didn't pay to see this overrated garbage.","Black Panther",2032,4.1,2.1

"2036",5,"  Another great movie Marvel, has me more excited to see the new Avengers!","Black Panther",2036,4.1,-0.9
"2037",2.5,"  All I can say is, meh. I thought Marvel was finally moving away from these boring, almost robotic movies after the ludicrously entertaining and refreshing Thor: Ragnarok and Spiderman Homecoming, but then this movie came out. This could just as easily have been spit out by a machine and there is barely any personality to it because God forbid Marvel say something potentially offensive about a minority. To me, the critical acclaim for this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of Wonder Woman last year. Message to all critics: just because there are minorities or 'oppressed' people in a movie, does not make it good. I'm sorry to get political, but I can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been judged by people thus far, so I needed to get it out of the way. Moving on...In terms of the script, characters, and film-making, this movie is just average. The characters aren't very well developed (what is Daniel Kaluuya's motivation), the villain - for all the critical acclaim he got - wasn't particularly good or well-developed, even though Michael B. Jordan was good in the role, and there are moments where you just ask yourself, ""Why should I care about this?"" I mean, it's not like Marvel could expect you to believe that the main character might die - he's in the fucking Infinity War trailer, for crying out loud! - or that any harm could come to anyone in the panther suit - they repeatedly explained that it was indestructible! I guess I'm just rambling at this point, but I don't feel that there is a coherent way to speak about the messy sludge that is this movie. Overall, the Marvel movie it most reminds me of is Age of Ultron - sure, it may have the $200 million budget to have decent special effects, but that doesn't mean that the movie is engaging or has any heart. To be perfectly honest I was bored at several points during the movie, and if I had had a watch I would certainly have checked it regularly. The whole point of Marvel movies is that they're meant to be enteratining, and this just wasn't to me. I know there are people out there who really connected to or at least enjoyed this movie, and you know what? Good for you. But I personally didn't enjoy this movie, and most certainly do not believe that 97% of critics did.","Black Panther",2037,4.1,1.6

"2039",1,"  I saw the movie... not that good really.. i cannot understand why this movie is better than thor ragnarok. I still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie than black panther.","Black Panther",2039,4.1,3.1
"2040",4,"  A very very good movie. The costume, the action sequences, the story, all were brilliant. Michael B. Jordan with a star-making performance. Utterly enjoyed it.","Black Panther",2040,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2041",0.5,"  Not that entertaining at all.","Black Panther",2041,4.1,3.6
"2042",2.5,"  Has possibly one of the best Marvel villains since the films began. Pacing is alright, costume design and lore steal the show. Action is alright, some scenes are incredible and others are confusing and the CGI doesn't do it justice. Acting is great all around, villain is the best character by far. Too many political and social messages put in to pander to that kind of crowd. One here or there would have been powerful and impactful, but there were so many that each one meant less than the last. Definitely worth seeing if you're a Marvel fan.","Black Panther",2042,4.1,1.6
"2043",4.5,"  An absolute gem of a film. From Coogler's direction and Boseman/Jordan at their best. Although it suffers from subpar CGI and a few cliche moments but that's few and far between. 92/100.","Black Panther",2043,4.1,-0.4
"2044",2,"  I honestly don't understand the hype for this movie. While the cast is phenomenal, and the setting of the movie is beautiful,, this movie at best is an average Marvel movie, and a suckfest at worst. T'Challa might be the worst superhero of all time because he clearly doesn't care about human life throughout the movie, all he cares about is a resource that he supposedly owns until the villain shows up. And if that's not bad enough, he's character is just bland compared to his portrayal in Civil War. No nuance at all, his character just goes through the motions and does exactly what you expect him to do. His nation Wakanda is also awful. They are nothing but a bunch of rich elites letting everyone else in Africa starve and die. I guess this a commentary on how the government neglects black communities, but the parallels aren't the same at all. Plus when T'challa says Kilmonger is no better that the enemies, which clearly are suppose to be nations that colonized other nations, the movie is somewhat backwards in it's message because Wakanda is no better than it's enemies either. Sure by the end T'challa learns his lesson and begins a new era for his people, but it's only because the villain was right the whole time. Something which i haven't seen in a superhero movie since The Dark Knight.The villain is definitely the bragging point of this movie. Kilmonger is not only a humanized character that you sympathize with, but he is also a perfect foil to T'challa in that he is a physical threat, and a moral enemy that counterbalances T'challa throughout the movie.Whatever themes this movie was trying to get across were shoved down your throat until you asphyxiate, or come suddenly out of no where to the point that it shatters your suspension of disbelief. If you decide to skip this movie, you're not really missing anything except a great villain.","Black Panther",2044,4.1,2.1
"2045",4.5,"  This was very interesting, enjoyable, and a feast for the eyes. You could definitely tell in our packed(!) theater what resonated with people, and when.I was a bit worried going in about how much action this action-adventure might have. But now I'm thinking that the early critics who said there wasn't enough action really wanted a Transformers movie. In the end what I wanted more character development, more Wakanda, and more of whatever T'Challa is wearing. It's not that there wasn't a lot of that, I just wanted more movie. Also, I might have chosen to wrap up the final scene a bit differently.Actually seeing Black Panther reminds me that Marvel is doing their usual minor bait and switch in the trailers. Like they did with Thor: Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy, they're always explicitly telling you what the movie is about, or what the main plot is, but almost never showing how it plays out--Think of Hela catching and breaking Thor's hammer in an alley... that turned out not to be an alley. The trailer is just an appetizer, the rest of the courses do arrive when you plant yourself in the seat.In the end, the film is a definite recommend for Marvel fans, and even a recommend for those that always think blockbusters and action films are often a bit too fluffy and just about blowing things up. This is a well realized, new world on film, that may just suck you right in.","Black Panther",2045,4.1,-0.4

"2054",2.5,"  It's sad that people are forced to over-rate a movie because it is socially important, when it should have just been made with the utmost care in the first place because of its great significance. There were some fantastic characters, costumes and themes but the plot was mediocre at best, dialogue was typical marvel corniness and I felt some of the remarks were more backwards and polarizing than progressive and aimed at diverse and equal representation. I think including certain dialogue actually gave people looking to dislike the film a somewhat valid reason to dislike it. Why couldn't this movie have been inscrutable so those voices would have no claim?","Black Panther",2054,4.1,1.6
"2055",5,"  Great movie, great message, visually amazing, and at the right time. A superhero movie that goes beyond the action heroes to remind us what is right and what leadership is about. And Africa gets its day at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism, no forced diaspora. Featuring wonderful actors, characters, and costumes. Way to go Marvel and Disney. Not a white guilt movie. This is how you do it, Hollywood!","Black Panther",2055,4.1,-0.9
"2056",4,"  What more could you want? The plot is downright Shakespearean borrowing aspects from King Lear and Richard III. The characters are incredibly well developed. The acting is on point, particularly with Michael B Jordan. The humor is present, but never annoying as is a common trap Marvel tends to fall into. The film gives a perfect balance of the humorous and the serious. My only gripe with the movie is that at times the pace seemed kind of slow. It's only 2.5 hours, but it felt like 3. Other than that, it's an incredibly solid film, and is easily in my Top 3 favorite Marvel movies.","Black Panther",2056,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2059",3.5,"  THIS IS WAS A GOOD MOVIE AND RIGHT ON PAR WITH OTHER MARVEL MOVIES. NOT A TOP 5 FOR ME BUT STILL ENTERTAINING. THE ACTION WASN'T VERY IMPRESSIVE TO ME, IT WAS JUST OK. THE CAST IS WHAT MAKES THIS A REALLY FUN FILM, EVERYONE DID A GREAT JOB IN THEIR ROLES.","Black Panther",2059,4.1,0.6
"2060",3.5,"  Very good movie ! Great plot structure that flowed nicely. Only thing I wish they would refrain from in a sequel would be less political banter. I understand the reasons why it was used but it was excessive and distracted from the plot imo. The film would have been 5/5 for me if it was more just of a focus on the story and its awesomeness ! Great job overall :)","Black Panther",2060,4.1,0.6
"2061",4,"  As with most Marvel movies, Black Panther is a great stand alone film and it's even better taken as part of the Marvel universe STORY LINE. The characters are wonderful and well developed EXCEPT the VILLAIN, Killmonger. He was 2 dimensional. His back story could have been the most interesting part of the movie, but it was glanced over. The context of his anger and HATRED was lost and he came across as just another VILLAIN with a monologue. Otherwise, it was a wonderful addition to the Marvel universe.","Black Panther",2061,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2069",5,"  ""Wise men build bridges, foolish men build barriers."" -T'Challa, The King of WakandaAfter almost a month since it's release I finally saw Black Panther. Took me way too long to see it. I'm just gonna start out saying it really isn't like most of Marvel's other movies. It has some of the most interesting production design I have seen in a Marvel production since Guardians of the Galaxy, and the score really sets the tone and separates it from the rest. The hand-to-hand combat is something Marvel has lacked in recent years mainly due to the fact that many of their heroes, and villains have powers, and instead rely more on CGI. I don't have a problem with this, but I haven't seen fight scenes in the MCU this well choreographed since Daredevil season 1, and Winter Soldier.Without revealing too much, the villain was dope, and might be one of my 3 favorite villains in the MCU. You actually feel sorry for him, and even the film itself feels this way too. It also wasn't too reliant on referencing other films. With a lot of Marvel films, they love referencing things that have either already happened, or will happen. With the exception of probably 3 moments in the film, Black Panther stands on its own feet. Even if you haven't seen Civil War, or any Marvel movies, I recommend giving this a watch.Overall, this is a film that deserves all the praise it's getting. It really isn't ""just another Marvel movie."" It is something special, and in terms of style, and story it has a lot to offer to the modern blockbuster. Check it out!#WakandaForever ?","Black Panther",2069,4.1,-0.9
"2070",4.5,"  Black Panther - Review (2018)The GoodChadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther is once again fantastic continuing how great he was in Civil War.Ryan Coogler's Amazing Direction he is now 3 for 3, Fruitvale Station, Creed and now this. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is Excellent - He could of been a generic Marvel villain, but nope even though he has Sparce screen time, the second half of the film does a great job going into his past providing some extremely compelling, plausible motivations for his actions. Jordan's physical intensity speaks for itself, helping create a righteously angry character who is far more ambiguous and sympathetic than you might initially expect. Even though Loki might be the better villain, he Killmonger is a better grounded villain The fantastic Supporting Cast - Danai Gurira as T'Challa's chief bodyguard Okoye and Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri, while Andy Serkis hams it up for the cheap seats as secondary villain Ulysses Klaue, Lupita Nyong'o brings plenty of gravitas to T'Challa's love interest Nakia, and Martin Freeman is hilariously incredulous as Everett Ross.Winston Duke, who steals several scenes in the role of M'Baku (Man-Ape), the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe.The World Building of Wakanda is the best in the MCU that you want to see more from its rich and beautiful nation and thankfully we won't have to wait long to see Wakanda again. It Fully Engages With Real-World History & Politics with Michael B. Jordan's character even though from Wakanda was raised in the States it also firmly and bluntly addressing the continued ill treatment of black people in the present day. It may not be subtle, but sometimes subtlety isn't needed, and if you look at the major racial issues prevalent in the U.S. alone todayAs always for Marvel the humor is there and it works, but its not a joke joke movie, its humor works in many ways that's subtle It also feels entirely different than any other MCU film. The Visual Dynamic Action scenes are fantastic with Ryan Coogler's amazing directionLudwig Göransson's amazing score and the Awesome Soundtrack produced by Kendrick Lamar The pacing feels great, nothing feels forgettable The post Credit scenes are awesome The BadThe Third Act while entertaining and awesome has CGI Overload especially when you see 2 animated figures fighting (its a small nit pick, but still)Overall: Marvel dominates again showing why they are the only ones who know how to do a Cinematic Universe well and doing it again this time with a Fantastic character like Black Panther.Overall Grade: A","Black Panther",2070,4.1,-0.4

All that mixed with the ingredients of a blockbuster film, a great cast, good humorous timing and spectacular set pieces makes for a very entertaining ride that works as a standalone film as well as part of the bigger picture. Sure, some of the action scenes might have looked even better with stunt people instead of CGI fighters, but the wonderful production design more than makes up for it. The right movie at the right time and more proof that Marvel is far from being a one trick pony.","Black Panther",2117,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2118",3.5,"  Let's get something straight, right off the bat. This was going to be huge, no matter where you stood. After all the hyperbole and media attention and passive-aggressive social media infighting, this movie struck a cord that is both surprising and quite obvious. Black Panther is the lore rich and spectacle-driven extravaganza that was promised. But it also gives a strong narrative and deep characters to anchor the experience. No, Black Panther is not the first superhero film helmed by a person of African descent. The media tends to forget that Blade and its sequels happened and yeah that's a bit upsetting considering what it did for the genre. But there's no getting around it - a big budget picture on this scale with an all-black cast is new and unique.Picking up from his introduction in Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa returns home to ascend the throne of Wakanda. The isolated, wealthy, and powerful nation thrives by its use of vibranium, which the country mines and hordes for its own use. Though there may be others who desire both the vibranium and the throne of Wakanda itself for greater ambitions... Chadwick Boseman always brings his best to the screen and he has been one of my favorites since his criminally underwatched turn in Get Up (which you should totally watch when you have the chance). His Black Panther is a refreshing change from many Marvel/Disney heroes - instead of hammy, sarcastic bluster, he keeps cool and calm and the bullshit to a minimum. There are also a number of excellent supporting female characters that impress with Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright leading the way. A friend of mine pointed out that Black Panther actually succeeds better at feminism than The Last Jedi, which tried to make that a central theme of the new sequel trilogy. Black Panther's female warriors and scientists are tough, hard-as-nails, and do their fucking job. You have to give credit where it's due. Of course, Black Panther has a worthy adversary in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, a pretender to the throne who wishes to end Wakanda's isolation and use its vibranium as a weapon in a new war that would allow persons of African descent to subjugate the world. T'Challa opposes this and wishes to change the world via public outreach and scientific exchange. These opposing worldviews call to mind the dynamic between Charles Xavier and Magneto and it is a comparison that Jordan has openly invited.Black Panther is not quite perfect, to be fair. The special effects in the third act look a bit cheap and dated. (Think 2005.) A few of the action sequences, such as the car chase, go on for too long and the CGI Rhinos were pretty fucking stupid and felt out of place. And I'm not quite sure if I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and call this the best standalone MCU movie ever - even recent entries such as Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 have a bit more oomph, but then again, those are ""bigger and better"" sequels and may not be entirely congruous. I look forward to seeing a similar sequel to Black Panther, so you should go ahead and take that as a recommendation. It certainly lands in the better half of the MCU. It may be important to note that the success of Black Panther has outsized implications for the entertainment industry at large. Movies will now be marketed to a more diverse group of demographics. But more personally to a large chunk of the international population, this was a movie for THEM and not what Hollywood usually hunts (i.e. guys who look like me.) And that's probably for the best.","Black Panther",2118,4.1,0.6

"2121",4,"  Good movie. I don't know if it lived up to the ""hype"", but I enjoyed it. It didn't feel exactly like any other MCU movie. In other words, it wasn't too formulaic. Personally, I liked Michael B. Jordan as the villain, and I related his character (which isn't common for villains in the MCU). And action? I thought there was enough, but maybe some critics were wanting some more. One of the reasons that I'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because I felt it was a little too long for what they were trying to do. But, overall, I had a great time, and I can't wait until the sequel comes out.","Black Panther",2121,4.1,0.0999999999999996

BP is a terrific film, with tremendous actors. Chadwick Boseman is terrific. the women of this film are amazing. Lupita is probably the strongest ""love interest"" we've ever had in the MCU, certainly since Peggy Carter. But it's Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira, who surprise us in the best way possible with their performances. The ageless Angela Bassett does a marvelous job.  Michael B. Jordan is a good villain. I don't know if he's as amazing as the critics think, but he was very good. This continues Marvel's hot steak of exellence. - Let's face it, if the weakest Phase 3 film is Guardians of the Galaxy 2, then you must be doing something right.","Black Panther",2125,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2131",5,"  THE QUALITY and importance of this movie cannot be underestimated","Black Panther",2131,4.1,-0.9
"2132",3.5,"  Another decent entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A interesting blend of James Bond, Game of Thrones, and Star Wars.It does nothing revolutionary, but offers the typical Marvel formula of big action, quirky humour, and likable characters, with a notably refreshing, more exotic locale. Falling in among the like of Doctor Strange and Thor in quality and memorableness.The movie continues shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War as T'Challa mourns the loss of his father T'Chaka and ascends to King of the African nation of Wakanda.You can tell that it is trying to relate to the issues brought up by Black Lives Matters and other racial oppression advocacy groups. It plays with the issues in the same way that Martin Luthor King Jr. and Malcolm X did over how to free people form oppression. It focuses on compassion and the responsibility we have to better the world as one people.Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa doesn't shine as bright as he could have due to his character's uncertainty of how best to act as the new King of Wakanda. As his performance is quite contemplative and subdued, he doesn't make the most interesting protagonist. Letitia Wright did a great job as T'Challa's younger sister Shuri, instilling some fun and playfulness into a movie of mostly serious personalities. Andy Serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as he plays the hammy Ulysses Klaue seeking wealth and taunting the good guys. Michael B Jordan's Erik Killmonger is the best performance of the movie with his character's righteous anger and bitterness of how he feels mistreated.Minor Spoiler Warning:If I had to list a complaint, it would be that the third act somewhat falls apart into a large brawl with many characters that you don't really feel much about. It steals much of the movie's elegance and style away for the sake of an unnecessary action scene. As well, one character close to T'Challa felt rather poorly developed to lead to their actions later in the film.All in all, if you like superhero movies or action movies, I would recommend seeing it. Not amazing, but better than average.Note: Depending on your memory, I would recommend seeing Captain America: Civil War before watching Black Panther. Possibly Avengers: Age of Ultron as well.","Black Panther",2132,4.1,0.6
"2133",5,"  Black Panther:Part cool demi-God Superhero, Part ""The Lion King"", Part 90s/early2000s Oakland: ""Black Panther"" is all awesome and much like Wonder Woman (2017) brings fresh perspectives to the genre and while may fall into some of the same ""tropes"" and has some questionable CGI and green screen decisions in its final act the story itself is so good and the character so engaging that one can forgive these nitpicks. ""Black Panther"" never lets on that it's even in the same universe as Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and the rest. Feeling as fresh as a movie 10 years into the ""Marvel experiment"" can. and this is the closest Marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years. Although this represents the first full outing for the Black Panther character (who made his debut in Captain America: Civil War), it's more of an ""introduction story"" than an ""origin story."" Coogler's approach is similar to the one Tim Burton used in 1989's Batman - don't waste the audience's time with a blow-by-blow description of how the Black Panther got his powers and what he initially does with them. Instead, tell a real story and sprinkle in the details along the way. It's a more satisfying method of storytelling that what we sometimes have to slog through with initial forays. As a result, Coogler's characters jump out of the screen - feeling as real and with as real a motivation as any have in the MCU to date.Everything about the design of the characters to the layout of the narrative seems to have been done with such a care and respect that it oozes out of each frame. A powerful story and driven by veteran direction pulling out emotional performances that we as an audience can empathize with. Much like his other works - Coogler has a really strong throughline in this film that carries his message of unity and empathy. All driven by performances that people can gush about for days. From Andy Serkis & Angela Bassett to Chadwick Boseman & Michael B. Jordan - everyone brings their ""A"" game. Black Panther is arguably the most audacious movie to emerge from the MCU to-date and has to be in the conversation when considering the all-time best comic book-inspired stories. Although the structure is rooted in the superhero tradition, the production rarely feels limited by that classification. It takes us to new places and sloughs off the generic label that adheres to many films of the genre, providing an experience that is by turns exciting, emotional, and funny.","Black Panther",2133,4.1,-0.9

The story is good, but drags on, this movie is over 2hrs long, and feels that way. Very little humor, which is a plus, but also the fight scenes aren't great. Worth a watch though. But definitely not a 97% movie like the critics gave it.","Black Panther",2152,4.1,1.1
"2153",4.5,"  The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed.","Black Panther",2153,4.1,-0.4
"2154",5,"  Black Panther is a great hero journey's story. Chadwick Boseman returns as the titular hero, and brings a king's gravitas to the role. Michael B Jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be out of place from a hero's. The stand out of the supporting cast is Letitia Wright whose Shuri, the little sister to T'Challa, is a playful nerd but when things get serious she will get her hands dirty in the action. Marvel has returned to its A game form.","Black Panther",2154,4.1,-0.9

"2156",4,"  In July of 1966, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the first black superhero to appear in mainstream comics; Black Panther first appeared in Fantastic Four and then Captain America, followed by a handful of others before finally getting his own run in 1973. A powerful and influential force in the Marvel universe, this character finally has his own film (not counting the 2014 fan film Storms of Carnage). Leading the way again, Black Panther is one of only a handful of black superheros to have achieved a prominent place on the silver screen, and it's been a runaway success.Black Panther is at least on a par with any of the other origin story marvel films, and perhaps does somewhat better, thriving on an established universe and reveling in the ability to break new ground - thematically and socially - with fresh characters, fresh environments and a fresh story.The film embodies the vision of Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote and directed. Coogler is both a champion of black empowerment and imagination and a comic fan and nerd in his own right; having also directed Creed, he was a natural choice to bring the project to life. This is perhaps most apparent in the setting of Wakanda, which embraces African tribal heritage and culture and makes it feel authentic and vital, while at the same time showing us that Wakanda is an educated, technologically advanced first-world country. Visual and production design has seldom been so strong in a Marvel film. The writing was solid, if somewhat predictable, with only one bit towards the end about sending out ships filled with weapons feeling weak; the character driven story was a fitting medium. Collaboration with Kendrick Lamar was a stunning success, as the soundtrack just shivered with African vibes and the occasional hip hop bounce throughout, nothing out of place and everything crafted with a wonderful attention to detail.The cast all performed well, and in an inversion of the Hollywood standard of racial inclusion a nearly all-black cast led by Chadwick Boseman and Michael B Jordan is fleshed out by token Caucasians in supporting, story-driven roles. Boseman is, without question, the outstanding performance in this film. No stranger to challenging performances, Boseman follows up three historical character portrayals with a role as superhero; while this seems like a freebie, Boseman brings real gravitas and dignity to his character, making it believable that this person could in fact be the benevolent monarch of a kingdom and not just a superficial quip-slinging comic avatar. Michael B Jordan's character started out being somewhat mysterious but slowly became less and less likable up until the very moment his history was revealed and he truly became relatable, his outrage and internal conflict palpable. Between the two of them there is a really interesting set of dichotomies besides just good guy/bad guy, down to the very essence of their characters; Boseman as African royalty and Jordan as an African American hip hop influenced bad boy.The supporting cast held up well, too. Lupita Nyong'o led a cast of great female supporting roles, and with any luck we'll get to see her as Malice in another Black Panther film. Andy Serkis shows his versatility as an actor, transforming himself into a vicious outlaw; in stark contrast, Forest Whitaker's mannerisms tend to take the audience out of the movie because despite whatever role he's playing he's still clearly Forest Whitaker. Martin Freeman's take on Everett Ross is pleasantly understated and appropriate despite his vaguely transatlantic accent. Of additional note, Winston Duke deserves mention for his performance in a minor but important role as the intimidating but sincere M'Baku.Beneath the film's spectacle of superheros and action pulses highly cogitative social undercurrents. While it would be very easy for a movie of this kind to become bitter and resentful with its message or overly self-righteous and preachy, this particular film manages to walk the line without falling into either thematic trap. The internal conflict of the antagonist is real and relatable enough that you can understand the resentment without endorsing it. From some of his lines, the animosity he feels for Europeans and those of European descent is obvious, echoing vindictive sentiments that have proliferated in America for years; however, the film has painted anger and hate as steps on the path to villainy and destruction. It acknowledges the issues of race in society and the accompanying bitterness without supporting it. Instead it offers the image of Wakanda and its champions as the path forward, suggesting without preaching that moving forward together to find solutions and peace is more productive than dwelling on ancient wrongs and feeding hatred. For a film to accomplish this subtly and without draining the fun out of the experience is a truly notable achievement and one worthy of recognition and praise.","Black Panther",2156,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2181",3.5,"  Solid acting performances turned in by the entire cast. A shame that the CGI didn't seem up to the same quality as the rest of the movie's elements. A welcome departure from what has become the standard MCU formula and it does most things very well. Still, one wonders how an advanced and enlightened culture like Wakanda's could have kept such an outdated concept like a physical trial to the death (or yield) to determine who is fit to rule.

"2204",5,"  While most of the plot is quite predictable - more so than other recent Marvel flicks - the story is still quite good and engaging. Despite being introduced to the character in Civil War, this film almost as an ""origin story"" feel to it, providing you with the history of Wakanda and who or what the Black Panther is and represents. In addition, the combination of old and new (African culture with future tech) is visually stunning, aside from a poorly-CGId ""waterfall scene"". Perhaps most surprising of all was that T'Challa is only the fourth or fifth most interesting character in the film. His sister, Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, steals the show with her wit and sarcastic humor; Danai Gurira is absolutely amazing as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o and Michael B. Jordan both kill it as their respective characters. While I found Thor: Ragnarok to be a better film overall, there's no denying the brilliance of Black Panther.","Black Panther",2204,4.1,-0.9
"2205",5,"  Great movie! Disney did an excellent job. I've sent it twice already.","Black Panther",2205,4.1,-0.9
"2206",3,"  Black Panther was a good super hero movie. But it wasn't a GREAT superhero movie and I'm having trouble understanding all the hype and flattery from the professional critics. Just to be clear, I love comic book characters brought to life on the big and small screens and it makes no difference who the publisher is as I have always read and enjoyed them all. Basically we have a movie here that is all bogged down in a Game of Thrones power struggle for who will be King of Wakanda. If that sounds a little thin for a A list Tent pole Super Hero movie, you understand my review of 3 stars. A lot of glitz, some great fight scenes. But the best fight scenes aren't necessarily the Black Panther. Danai Gurira (Michonne on Walking Dead) pretty much stole every scene she was in and had far more interesting and realistic fight scenes, since she did them without some funky super costume that the Panther never had in the comics. Not bad, but massively over rated. Puts me in the mood to go watch Luke Cage on Netfix for a better superhero movie and a MUCH MUCH better soundtrack. Imagine if that were all there was to Wonder Woman. Or the most recent Thor. Loki kicking out Odin and ruling Asgard was just one part of a much grander story.","Black Panther",2206,4.1,1.1
"2207",3,"  Fairly generic marvel movie with a bland script that is using other methods to gain praise.","Black Panther",2207,4.1,1.1
"2208",2.5,"  I wanted to fall asleep halfway thru. The villian (michael b jordan) i thought couldnt have been a worse pick. He did not fit and acting was not believable. The story line was drawn out on really nothing, most of the scenes were fillers in my opinion for what the real story line shouldve been. Nice visual effects, and the main character did a great job.","Black Panther",2208,4.1,1.6
"2209",4.5,"  This movie mixes aspects of action,grief and humor perfectly that you will want to watch this movie more than once.The backdrop of Africa is represented very well . The actors in this movie are perfect for their respective roles and portray their roles uniquely for example T'Challa is a reserved character while Klaw is a energetic character.I loved the background music of this movie as it perfectly connects with different parts of the film.The director who is known for Creed,perfectly showed why his film are worthy to win Oscars(Creed rings a bell).This movie is enjoyable and action packed till the end.","Black Panther",2209,4.1,-0.4

"2221",4.5,"  Black PantherInitial Reaction: He has the Cowl and he's on the prowl.

He's played by Chadwick Boseman Erik Killmonger: He's a soldier with a secret. He's played by Michael B Jordan.Plot Summary Things are going as usual for the people in Black Panther's city. That is until one of their most wanted criminals - a guy named Claw - shows up on radar and they have to go out there and take him in for justice. However, the capture of Claw goes really badly, and what's worse is that someone lese - Erik - shows up vying for the right to wear the Black Panther's necklace armor (that's a necklace that turns into a full suit of armor)SCORINGMain Characters I like these two a lot as the opposite sides of a coin. They both want the powers of the Black Panther for differing reasons. SCORE: 9Supporting Cast The rest of the cast is also well done. Sure, we've got the royal family, but every member has a quirk. For instance, there's the princess who could give Tony Stark a run for his tech money, a queen who has a lot of sass and wisdom, and the dearly departed king (died in Captain America: Civil War) who is the sage. SCORE: 9Plot It's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with a few nice twists thrown in. But some of the action sequences go on for a bit too long for my liking. SCORE: 8Originality This may be the first superhero film with a large black ensemble cast, but the characters have a lot of personality in them. SCORE: 9Violence Factor This is a superhero film, so some of the action sequences are really over the top. Heroes can get thrown all over the place and can fall great distances without getting hurt. But this one really pushes the limit. SCORE: 8Other Moral Issues This film doesn't do much with the racial issue (which may be a good thing). Instead it shows a side of blacks that needed to be shown.

"2226",4,"  Con Black Panther la Marvel ha fatto un enorme salto in avanti, dopo tanto tempo ci offre un'opera completa, sensibile e profonda che ha molto altro da dire rispetto alla solita storia di un supereroe. Visivamente il film non è male, presenta alcune riprese fatte molto bene con buoni effetti speciali: alcune scene d'azione risultano ancora convenzionali e non del tutto convincenti ma nel complesso intrattengono. Sono i personaggi e le loro interazioni la parte migliore del film, con in assoluto il miglior villain della Marvel finora, un personaggio super motivato che ha un ruolo fondamentale per tutta la narrazione e per il messaggio intrinseco di tutto il film. Sicuramente gran parte del merito va a Ryan Coogler, un grandissimo regista emergente che dimostra per la terza volta il suo talento, sia nelle riprese che nelle modalità della storia e della sceneggiatura.

"2228",4,"  With ""Black Panther,"" writer/director Ryan Coogler pumps a much needed shot of adrenaline and originality into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Though it follows the typical Marvel narrative structure almost to a T, the film stands above many of its predecessors because of its vividly unique aesthetics (captured beautifully by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison), its booming soundtrack curated by Kendrick Lamar, and its rock solid main cast--notably Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, who is one of the most charismatic and tantalizing comic book villains we've seen in quite some time. Other standouts include Chadwick Boseman as the title hero and Lupita Nyong'o as his ally/on-and-off lover. However, the true show-stealer is Andy Serkis, whose brief but mesmerizing performance as a psychopathic arms dealer is utterly unforgettable. Ultimately, ""Black Panther"" is an enormously fun movie that is by no means as political as many have attempted to make it out to be. Its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for Marvel, but that doesn't make them any less powerful in this bold, new context.","Black Panther",2228,4.1,0.0999999999999996

Jordan's performance a little over-the-top and not 3 dimensional. I mean the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't show much depth, instead he was huffing and puffing and gave off a ghetto vibe most of the time, which I know exists, there are people who are like that most of the time but from an actor of his caliber, in a movie like this, I expected more nuance and depth.","Black Panther",2231,4.1,-0.4

"2236",3,"  Honest review, Meh... for theater but good for DVD or StreamingI really like the main actor and most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job overall. The story was interesting overall and didn't feel like I wasted my money like Star Wars.For the price I give it a 3The problems that stopped me from a 5 star or 41. The CGI with the ship flying around during the first act really looked like old tech from 10 years ago. I'm not sure if it was the way it flew or the shadowing but it was off and distracting.. almost looked pasted in cheaply. 2. I understand that a tribe in Africa do have disks in their lips but to keep showing it was goofy. 3. The fight scene on the water fall when they showed them fighting close to the edge and where the Shaman spoke looked like a very bad green screen job and dated.4. Unlike other Marvel movies where they have fun and sharp witted humor this was dry and not really fun at all.5. Some of the fight stunts were way over the top and just too much... expected a little more since this movie was trying to be of a more serious tone6. They don't seem to have a problem putting down the US... 7. The white main bad guy's missing arm part didn't look right and when sitting in the chair you can tell he just had a green sock over his forearm... 8. The token white guy CIA agent didn't fit the part9. Hints of Racism against whites is not a good idea at all since this will be the main audience paying to go to this and is not a good step to try and heal overblown media sensationalized for votes racism in the US10. Many dark scenes that were hard to see the people no matter what color of skin they have and very hard to see when the Hero is wearing a black suit...11. The club fight scene was very blurry and out of focus. The camera moved so much that it just seemed like a mess and was hard to see the action for most of it.Bottom line: Worth a rent and maybe they could get better writing, director and CGI people in the next one and leave out the racism. Black people have been in top Positions in Movies, TV shows, Sports, Music, Science, Military, Police, Medicine for a very very very long time and I think the first woman in this country to be a self made millionaire was Black back in the late 1800s...so to act like this is the first is kinda stupid and too be honest doesn't help with race relations in this country at all. hope this helps","Black Panther",2236,4.1,1.1
"2237",2,"  very average superhero movie. basic marvel formula and standard quality, but CGI is outdated looking. movie is also quiet racist towards white people.","Black Panther",2237,4.1,2.1
"2238",4,"  I am just an average White guy; I think this is just a pretty good Marvel Movie. But, that's what make it great, it's not meant for me. This movie made me like the thirsty gambler even more.","Black Panther",2238,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2239",3,"  Don't pay extra for the 3D version. There were few effects that made it worth the 3D viewing.","Black Panther",2239,4.1,1.1
"2240",2.5,"  Kind of a weak script,, just wasn't my type of movie. It was fair, but I wouldn't see it twice.","Black Panther",2240,4.1,1.6
"2241",5,"  One of the best MCU movies till date. And it doesn't feels like a superhero movie but a movie about a a different culture or a country that is highly advanced and rich.","Black Panther",2241,4.1,-0.9
"2242",5,"  Top notch spy/political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the best villains that Marvel has put out to date. The entire cast is top notch and nail their roles, with Michael B Jordan's being particularly stellar. Marvel has a great product and they continue to churn out hits. I am slightly biased having read comics as a kid, but I believe we are now living in a Golden Age of Marvel come to the Big Screen. Excelsior!","Black Panther",2242,4.1,-0.9
"2243",1.5,"  Wow....so full of pushing agendas, forgot to tell the story. Very disappointing and a let down. Nice clothes, cars and special affects.","Black Panther",2243,4.1,2.6
"2244",5,"  Black Panther is the best action superhero movie! Black Panther presents a wonderful story and the actors are amazing! I highly recommend that you go see this spectacular movie!","Black Panther",2244,4.1,-0.9
"2245",4,"  I liked it, it was very good. A bit slower than other Marvel films but I'll definitely watch it again and look forward to a sequel!","Black Panther",2245,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2246",3,"  Good movie overall and great special effects. Another marvel origin movie in the books.","Black Panther",2246,4.1,1.1
"2247",5,"  The greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made. Visually, sonically, and culturally unlike anything ever seen on screen. Ryan Coogler is an absolute genius and the cast are immortalized as the characters forever. See this movie more than once and celebrate it with others.","Black Panther",2247,4.1,-0.9
"2248",3,"  It was ok. Way to long and takes to long to get were it's going. The main villain was great just sucks the get rid of him at the end would love to have scene him in future sequal. Golum aka Andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in any more marvel films. Bilbo Baggins was ok he did his role. All In all worth seeing. But dont believe the hype","Black Panther",2248,4.1,1.1
"2249",5,"  Full of logical inconsistencies, unrealistic Hollywood glamour, and seriously un-affectimg. The only value I can see is for a future film class to give an award to the student who can find the most flaws in this pretentious failure.","Black Panther",2249,4.1,-0.9
"2250",3,"  Honestly wasn't that good. I understand this move is a big deal because of the black superhero thing but it really wasn't that great. The dopey white character shot down a few ships and saved the world? really?","Black Panther",2250,4.1,1.1
"2251",5,"  This was a incredible movie. With multiple lessons and meanings that describe how we need to act in this world.","Black Panther",2251,4.1,-0.9
"2252",2,"  I get that the movie carried a message of sorts, but the harsh stereotypes should have raised a red flag to the politically correct pundits who gave this movie a 97%. The excessive use of hand-to-hand combat in a society that is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is OK to fight. Nice message to minority kids. The use of war Rhinoceroses instead of mechanized weapons also makes no sense and would be met with outrage if this were any other movie set in modern times. Why are they selling baskets on the street in what should be the worlds most advanced city? And why is everyone wearing pimped out versions of ancient African ceremonial garments? Wouldn't that be like putting modern Europeans in powdered wigs and colonial clothing? The plot is a little thin, too. For example there is the small matter of T'Chala being alive, which means that he is unequivoqually still the king, everyone except warmonger should immediately recognize this and the big battle at the end should have simply been the completion of the sanctioned fight for the throne. Oh, except that war monger murdered Zuri in cold blood, which should have resulted in an immediate tribunal. Sorry, that whole portion of th emovie was justs rediculous. Then there's the whole James Bond rip-off complete with a casino, remote controlled cars and Felix Leiter, oops, I mean Everett Ross, the CIA agent. All pretty trite. In the end, a movie that could have been culturally transcendental ended up being about an angry boy growing up and taking revenge on the son of his father's killer. Stupid message. Fairly stupid movie. Lately, all the Marvel movies look grand in the commercials but end up being about internal strife among the players. This one follows that formula exactly. Let's hope the next few are better.","Black Panther",2252,4.1,2.1
"2253",3,"  I always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie ,I've seen just about every one of them . Movie was a bit overhyped in my opinion, but the storyline was good .seen the movie twice and I feel 3 stars is a fair rating , excited to see black panther and guardians in the new avengers .","Black Panther",2253,4.1,1.1
"2254",3.5,"  Watching the Black Panther movie made that 10% part of me fill with pride, my mixed remaining 90% didn't believe the fantasy. Watch what happens in South Africa 20 years from now and you'll see what I mean; having said that, I enjoyed the movie generally speaking, it has less action, I'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies, but I like all the different types of movies that are being made with super heroes in them, not everything should be pure action, the movie kept me entertained. Considering some of the small propaganda it sold to my 10%, at least it wasn't as in your face as The Last Jedi was and it ends up as the better movie in the process. Overall I give the movie a 7 out of 10, definitely worth the $5.50 I paid to see it and a possible DVD purchase in the future","Black Panther",2254,4.1,0.6
"2255",3.5,"  Unlike other Marvel movies, this tackles social and historical issues of African Americans. Giving a soul of its own. A utopia in film for all minorities. However it lacks the action that I love in marvel films, and focused more on the story.","Black Panther",2255,4.1,0.6
"2256",5,"  Great movie. Top 5 best Marvel movies.","Black Panther",2256,4.1,-0.9
"2257",0.5,"  Horrible. I never thought I would say this but, for the first time I hate a marvel film. Movies are supposed to be fun not another political arguement. Get off you damn high horse and leave the politics out of movies. if I wanted to hear more of this crap I would watch the news.","Black Panther",2257,4.1,3.6
"2258",5,"  I would take everyone and anyone to see this movie. The characters are great, the story is beautiful and is the best Marvel movie so far. Black Panther deserves all the love and praise.","Black Panther",2258,4.1,-0.9
"2259",3,"  If you like African culture, then this movie is for you, otherwise you won't connect with the movie.","Black Panther",2259,4.1,1.1
"2260",5,"  not you're typical superhero movie. its not predictable and has a good blend of action and humor. overall a good movie. definitely recommend for a Friday night with friends.","Black Panther",2260,4.1,-0.9
"2261",5,"  Smart, subtly and suitably edgy, and complex entertainment for audiences of various ages. Well worthy of the MCU superheroes and more.Loved the rich storytelling and myth-making. From the costuming to the sets and scenery. From the music to the technology. With strong females and strong males.Loved every minute of it. Can't wait to see it again.","Black Panther",2261,4.1,-0.9
"2262",0.5,"  This was boring, recycled ideas rolled into a crappy CGI exterior. Everything it did has been done better in other movies. The definition of a middle of the road, mediocre snore-fest.","Black Panther",2262,4.1,3.6
"2263",3,"  If you like Marvel super hero movies, you will like this movie. It has the same feel as the other super hero movies. Plot and storyline are very good. The story and development of the villain are fantastic. Action wasn't as good as some of the previous Marvel movies but the significance, story and development of the Black Panther make up for it.","Black Panther",2263,4.1,1.1
"2264",5,"  Honestly the main reason I want to see this is because it's before infinity war.","Black Panther",2264,4.1,-0.9
"2265",3,"  Overhyped. Set up for a failure.. It was decent. Not bad for sure, but not good either. I was prepared for multiple viewings, but I probably won't now. Enough people will see it anyways in support. The movie had extreme down moments, mediocre to bad CGI in some scenes, not nearly enough action, music was good but a little too loud over some dialogues, somewhat inconsistent character study (different to what we saw in Civil War), awesome villain and support casters, and thoughtful messages.","Black Panther",2265,4.1,1.1
"2266",4.5,"  This film is centered around the Black Panther (T'Challa), returning to Wakanda, and becoming king after his father's death. The dialogue is great, and the VFX is perfect! I give this film 95%.","Black Panther",2266,4.1,-0.4
"2267",5,"  One of my favorite Marvel comic movies so far. Very colorful in culture, great story line, very well made, unique costume designs and talented casts. Must see!","Black Panther",2267,4.1,-0.9
"2268",3,"  Good characters, good story. Too much cgi crazy stuff. Also didn't like how much like iron man this black panther is. Black Panther was great with his physical and mental prowess, cunning like a panther. Seems movies try to make all superheroes ultimate powerful now. Worth watching, only average good tho.","Black Panther",2268,4.1,1.1
"2269",3,"  Eventhough this film was hyped by alot of people, I didnt like the film all that much. The film has a great opening and the as the intro finished, the quality of the film deteriorates at high speed leaving me dissapointed at the end. This film really saves itself with the great music and really likeable carracters. The film has an overused plot and ending, its too typical for a hero-film.","Black Panther",2269,4.1,1.1
"2270",3.5,"  Solid Marvel film, one of the better ones. I don't know why there are people on this site giving it 5 stars when they haven't seen it, leaving such reviews as ""Can't wait to see it, got my tickets"" - If you are doing that please stop, We need a genuine audience score to counteract the Critics who are now suspect after Last Jedi, please do not continue this absurd behavior or the site loses all meaning. If you are on the RT staff please take note that this is happening.","Black Panther",2270,4.1,0.6
"2271",2.5,"  really wanted it to be great but it doesn't meet the hype - just OK.","Black Panther",2271,4.1,1.6
"2272",4.5,"  Good movie. Likable characters and very original.","Black Panther",2272,4.1,-0.4
"2273",5,"  BRILLIANT WATCHED TWICE`!!.AS has ALMOST EVERYONE I KNOW","Black Panther",2273,4.1,-0.9
"2274",3.5,"  Entertaining but can do with a little more humour and emotion, lame story, way overrated, inferior to Wonder Woman or Iron Man.","Black Panther",2274,4.1,0.6
"2275",3.5,"  I was fascinated with the film the first couple of hours but then suddenly started being a common super heroe movie, with bunch of CGI and people hitting each other","Black Panther",2275,4.1,0.6
"2276",2,"  It's not a terrible film, but not memorable either. For a $200 million the SFX are embarrassingly bad in some places and I nearly fell asleep during the first half. It's on par with the first Thor movie and no way deserving of 90% and above. I'm honestly shocked it would get anything over 70%.This says a lot about critics being afraid to honestly review this movie. In particular all the comments about being a ""game changer"" and ""best super hero movie ever"". That's all nonsense. It's a mediocre comic book movie, that's all.","Black Panther",2276,4.1,2.1
"2277",2,"  No superhero actions. No superhero personality. Somebody trains in normal world and then comes and kicks away T' Chala and takes away the throne. Even the army of Wakanda, 4 of their top warriors had to fight Kill Monger alone and they got beat too. T'Chala fought Captain America and he fought well. I didn't like how Black Panther was shown.","Black Panther",2277,4.1,2.1
"2278",5,"  Beautiful film with an amazing story!!!! I want to watch again","Black Panther",2278,4.1,-0.9
"2279",3.5,"  While this film suffers from the same problems almost every Marvel does ( lack of a good villain, childish humor, and a less than stellar script), it does a good amount of things right to make it an extremely enjoyable watch. While it is far from being perfect, a great cast, good directing, and an engaging story, this is a fun film that will be easy to come back to.","Black Panther",2279,4.1,0.6
"2280",5,"  Saw it for the first time and i was blown away by the story and the visuals!","Black Panther",2280,4.1,-0.9
"2281",5,"  My Favourite Marvel Movie!!!!","Black Panther",2281,4.1,-0.9
"2282",5,"  Aside from the CGI, this film is pretty much a perfect superhero movie. A great story, excellent world building, fantastic cast, one of the best villains the MCU has ever had, and one of it's best heroes... instantly moves into my top 10 superhero movies of all time.","Black Panther",2282,4.1,-0.9
"2283",0.5,"  I found it hard to care about a country whose existence made very little sense. If such a country with such recourses existed for millennia, world history would not be as it is today. How would the Atlantic Slave Trade have existed as it does in reality if such a material as 'vibranium' offered the possibilities it did? How would it be possible to hide such a recourse within a made-up boarder? Yes, Wakanda is supposedly mountain-locked, but I doubt the native people would have been unable to get in and out of the Wakandan region. Furthermore, I highly doubt they would want to keep such a material for themselves - if it is so amazingly good that it can fuel countries and heal people as it does in the film, why on earth would the Wakandan's not want to trade the material for wealth? They clearly must have and did, as 'Killmonger' (a terrible name that seems to have been thrown in for the sake of it, as this is still a comic-book movie) reveals that vibranium had travelled in the form of an axe-thing outside of Wakanda. Speaking of 'Killmonger', I am surprised as to the praise that has been given to such a character. I do not mind Killmonger's absurd racism, as characters - especially villains - should be allowed to have flawed opinoins. However, 'Killmonger' simply wants to take over the world with the ridiculous war-technologies created by Wakanda's princess (even though I do not see why an isolationist and secretive Wakanda would ever bother to have made such weapons. Wakandans would be facing no competition from foreign innovators, and so surely they would prefer to remain in stasis, much like Japan did during its isolationist period. The desire to cling on to backwards traditions, such as electing a King through combat, or even just a monarchy in itself, is seen to be held by the aristocracy and T'Challa himself, but this doesn't fit with the additional facts that Wakanda employs spies across the world and lives with gadgets only dreamt of. Are they involved and competing with the world and the times, or not?) because he tells us that he feels that he has been owed more from the world. If we are told of Killmonger's desires in one scene, rather than shown what Killmonger wants out of life through the way he lives it, how can he be considered a well-developed character? The idea of destroying the world isn't that interesting, either. I'm confused as to why 'Killmonger' wouldn't simply stick to wanting revenge on Wakanda for betraying him. Martin Freeman's character seemed a little out of place, as I did not understand why a CIA operative would voluntarily help out the Wakandan King, even though he is willing to make business with Wakanda's most wanted criminal, played by Andy Serkis. The problems with Andy Serkiss' character was simply his forced comedy - it made it ridiculous to believe that this is the only outsider to evade capture from the overly high-tech Wakandans for so long. Not to mention that I did not find any of the jokes funny. Of course, humour is subjective, but the comedy here seemed to mostly comprise of half-baked references to things in popular culture as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes. I may retract that last complaint about the humour getting in the way drama, as during T'Challa's talks with his father, he is uninterrupted in chastising him. This brings me on to my complaints about the Wakandan culture and the conspiracy about T'Chacka and his brother. The death of T'Chacka's brother was not as emotional as the film seemed to want it to be received as, because the audience does not know T'Chacka or his brother. Why should I care about the death of some terrorist who I do not have a connection to? Furthermore, T'Chacka's blunder in not dealing with his nephew was distractingly stupid - he could have easily had the boy killed or better yet, just brought up in Wakanda. He definitely know about his existence, as the Wakandan's seem to know everything when it benefits them. The culture of the Panther god is thrown in and unexplored, which begs the question as to why it was included. The ability to speak to the dead was not in itself a flaw, but I would merely personally prefer it if the film did not look at the beliefs of the Wakandans as objectively true. The princess directly says in a line to the Ross that Wakanda's achievements are not made by magic, but it seems like they truly are, as their God seems to exist without a shadow of a doubt. Wakandans are unchallenged in their world view, even though there is clearly room in the film to explore the shortcomings of the backwards society which seems to hate foreigners unfairly.Lastly, I'll say that the action scens were not satysfying, largely due to their lack of importance. The challenges for the throne of Wakanda had no stakes, as it was obvious that T'Challa would be king and that T'Challa would be defeated but not killed by 'Killmonger'. T'Challa is thrown off a waterfall by 'Killmonger' instead of being brutally hacked to death ,which is what I would have wanted from such a villain who has 'kill' in his name. Yet why would the film end without T'Challa fixing everything? This is part of a series of films, only really involving one important character - The Black Panther. Was 'Killmonger' going to replace T'Challa as The Black Panther? Perhaps he should have, but of course not. I would have hoped that in working with the necessities of having T'Challa as the Black Panther at the film's start and end, so that other films are not affected by the Black Panther film, T'Challa would learn to become a villain in order to rule over his selfish Wakandan people, who turn their backs on the world to live in their own fantasies. The film would have worked similarly, though this would have allowed for a more interesting character in T'Challa, who actually changes more severely from hero to villain. The bloodless nature of the action, as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me. One of the earlier fight scenes in Creed had severely impressed me, however I could not coherently take in some of the scenes with the Panther in the dark, and laughed out loud when one of the bald ladies supposedly had her throat slit. Also; spears are objectively inferior to guns, no matter what metal they are made from. I know it was probably supposed to be a joke when the lady calls guns 'primitive', but her combat prowess seemed cheated on screen, as she was effectively protected from harm by convenience and not killing efficiently enough to redeem such luck. Thus, watching her fight did not contain much interest to me, as I was effectively told that she was not supposed to lose a fight. Similarly, T'Challa was given so much technological advantage that there seemed to be little reason to worry about any of his fights. Thus, at the end of the day, what was the point of this movie? To entertain? That was hindered by the assurance that T'Challa will be The Black Panther for many films to come, and thus nothing too bad will happen to him. To educate? Wakanda is a ficitonal hodge-podge of African aesthetics (and even Indian ones, as to me it seemed that T'Challa was wearing kurtas and his love-interest was ineffectively wielding Chakrams. I don't know if these are also native to some African tribes as well) so I didn't really believe the supposed sincerity held within this comic book story. Oh, and the gorilla people living in mountain caves felt a little too much like a Tolkien rip-off for me - they even suddenly join in to turn the tide of the final brawl. Tolkien did not invent these ideas, but his over-use in the past century would make me additionally precautions in including ideas which can easily be found in his works.","Black Panther",2283,4.1,3.6
"2284",2.5,"  Overall an OK movie. The story was a little slow and I might even say boring. The action sequences really saved this movie. The car chase was awesome. The political messages are mixed. They say some things one way, but their society reflects another. See if you can tell what I mean. Kinda funny and I highly doubt it was intentional. Stick to making movies.","Black Panther",2284,4.1,1.6
"2285",4,"  When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here.","Black Panther",2285,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2286",5,"  I was nervous going in to see this movie after the last Thor movie (time length wise). However, I enjoyed every minute of this movie. I don't know how to describe it without spoilers, just go see it.","Black Panther",2286,4.1,-0.9
"2287",4,"  Another success for the MCU!Really enjoyed this. I thought it had a solid story with great world building. Two really good antagonised in Killmonger and Klaw. I thought the CGI was a bit off on a couple occasions, but nothing major. There's no real weak character's in the film, I thought they were all pretty decent and overall I had a lot of fun with this movie.","Black Panther",2287,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2288",2.5,"  Hampered by inevitable fatigue, Black Panther rises above the typical super hero fare in context only.","Black Panther",2288,4.1,1.6
"2289",4.5,"  Black panther adds something new to superhero movies. It brings culture and deals with real world issues. The cast is fantastic and the villain in this is one of the best in the entire MCU. He is given a story that makes you feel for the character and at times I kind of wanted to side with his opinion of what the ways things should be. The visuals for the most part are good, at times the CGI gets a little more noticeable though. this film is more serious then many of the MCU but still gets in its laughs. tHis might not be my most favourite MCU, although it is one of them, but it is the one that i respect the most. Overall Black panther is a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for the rest of the superhero films to come out this year.9.0/10","Black Panther",2289,4.1,-0.4
"2290",3,"  Pretty darn good, not great. 3 leads were great (Chadwick, Lupita, and Danai). Had trouble getting over the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still relies on fighting to the death to decide which man will rule over them without question. Hmmmmm. Wakanda loses some respect there. The movie looks great, with very good actors involved. Not one of the best Marvel films by a long shot, but a good film that is fun to watch. That said, I did not enjoy the fight scenes much. They were a bit hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting. I thought they might fight like smooth cats, or like ninjas with clever fight moves.","Black Panther",2290,4.1,1.1
"2291",2.5,"  A regular run of the mill story with beautiful visuals. Acting is ordinary or bad.Nothing new or spectacular except the geography.","Black Panther",2291,4.1,1.6
"2292",3,"  This one started slow and finished strong. Loved the more developed villains. Much better than the typical ""I'm going to end the world"" super baddies in most of these marvel flicks. This one had some depth and reason ala Spiderman/Vulture. But, just took so long to get there.","Black Panther",2292,4.1,1.1
"2293",5,"  Best Marvel movie so far. I'm surprised I would say that after Thor 3, but this movie far exceeded it. Charming characters, amazing visuals, displaying the beautiful African culture, cool weapons and technology, the social obligation of a nation..this film has done an excellent job in all aspects. Now let's sit back and wait what Infinity war has to offer!","Black Panther",2293,4.1,-0.9
"2294",5,"  Absolutely stunning! The best movie I've seen in a really long time. I was mesmerized, and lost in the film like I was a kid again. I'll probably go to the theater again to see it. WoW!!!!!!","Black Panther",2294,4.1,-0.9
"2295",5,"  it looks so cool i want to see so bad....","Black Panther",2295,4.1,-0.9
"2296",5,"  Easily the most interesting as entertaining of The MCU films.","Black Panther",2296,4.1,-0.9
"2297",3.5,"  This is one of those movies where you order the large popcorn big enough for refills, sneak in some bunch a crunch and raisinets, and find a good seat. What you won't realize until you're 10 minutes in is that you will have to pace yourself through that popcorn, because you won't want to miss a single frame. Though it's not the best MCU film, it's right up there with the homecoming of the friendly neighborhood spider-man.","Black Panther",2297,4.1,0.6
"2298",2.5,"  It was ok but not my favorite Marvel movie. Great scenery and good story line but not much action.","Black Panther",2298,4.1,1.6
"2299",0.5,"  High expectations thx to critics reviews, Marvel movies aren't my preference but this was a stinker. 1 star rating due to RT banning negative reviewers- come get me.","Black Panther",2299,4.1,3.6
"2300",4,"  Magnificent production values and breathtaking special effects highlight this more-serious-than-usual Marvel superhero adventure which has a definite statement to make.","Black Panther",2300,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2301",5,"  Excellent movie, not perfect but very good!","Black Panther",2301,4.1,-0.9
"2302",5,"  A refreshing super hero! Black Panther has humor, hero's and heart!","Black Panther",2302,4.1,-0.9
"2303",2.5,"  Anything that had to do with the journey of a warrior-king was well done, but it was sullied anytime it got too contemporary or inserted cringey jokes. I'd actually really love to see what Coogler could do with a straight fantasy story.For an MCU movie in 2018, the CG was way too inconsistent, and when it was bad it was real bad. The general design of Wakanda was great and the costumes design was good, but Wakanda did not feel like a living breathing place. It felt like maybe a couple hundred people lived there, most of which were the nobility and the warrior castes. They really missed an opportunity to convey to us in some way what life was like for the average Wakandan.Overall, overhyped and overrated basic entry into the MCU. They should have played up the fantasy and put more effort into world-building and CG quality.","Black Panther",2303,4.1,1.6
"2304",5,"  I don't see my previous review, hopefully this isn't a duplicate. I loved this movie, have seen it three times, and will likely see it again. I felt almost as strongly about Civil War and Thor:Ragnarok, but this one touched me on a deeper level because of the ""villain"". Michael B. Jordan put so much heart and HURT into his character, that it's hard not to want to take the hurt away. Not that his plan is good, you obviously can't agree with it, but you can understand why he's so angry. Shuri delivered some funny lines, but if you aren't familiar with some of the teen slang and a Willow Smith song, it may not be obvious. The CGI sucked, but that's so frequently the case with Marvel that it's almost a requirement. I loved the way women were presented as strong, and willing to fight and die for their country above all else. No movie is perfect, neither is this one, but it's really REALLY great!!","Black Panther",2304,4.1,-0.9
"2305",5,"  An absolute Marvel masterpiece. You truly couldn't go wrong with it. Everything about this movie is awesome.","Black Panther",2305,4.1,-0.9
"2306",0.5,"  Let's see if RT shows my review this time. This movie was nothing but pandering to the division of the races. I was so turned off that I walked out and asked for a refund....didn't get it.","Black Panther",2306,4.1,3.6
"2307",5,"  Absolutely loved this film! Best Marvel movie, to date. So much to like about this film. Perhaps my biggest complaint, was why did it take so long for this character to make it to the screen? Why did we have to endure multiple Iron Man's, when this single film is better than all three (and the Avengers) combined? Great action, tempo and acting. No throw-away characters! The director was spot-on, didn't shy away from tough subjects, but wove a tale that was uniquely appealing to the entire audience. Excellent film, definitely deserves a Best Picture nod, when the time comes.","Black Panther",2307,4.1,-0.9
"2308",4,"  Short of some characters, the ties to the MCU are not that strong. The in/end credit scenes bring some strength in. A bit of overacting, some expected (Klaue), some not (Killmonger). The twist in the story was great.","Black Panther",2308,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2310",2.5,"  Poor effects, lack of tension, a bland script, and a flat lead keep the movie from achieving any sort of merit with me. Not terrible, but worse than the standard that Marvel has set. Even ignoring trailers and videos, I was disappointed, and not satisfied with the bland, obvious political/social commentary in the film. Clearly just a product designed to cash in on audiences. The action lacked suspense and thrill, and the skill of T'Challa was incredibly inconsistent. The suit provides a complete crutch, and there's no suspense as long as he's wearing it, because kinetic energy (ie. bullets, attacks etc.) just increases his strength. The comedy falls completely flat, and is incredibly distracting from the overall image the movie tries to make. The music is bland and unfitting, with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of sequences that don't fit.","Black Panther",2310,4.1,1.6
"2311",4.5,"  This movie is a masterpiece in every since . Representing african culture in a beautifull way . It is a smart and political awate movie","Black Panther",2311,4.1,-0.4
"2312",2,"  Maybe all the hype had my expectation bar set a little high. Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie i my opinion.","Black Panther",2312,4.1,2.1
"2313",5,"  I've watched all of the Marvel movies at least 3 times, including the last Thor and Black Panther. Not feeding into the hype but it is clearly one of the best and is an amazing movie. Wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away that it is great. I'm still a Cap guy though but this ranks up there with Civil War/Winter Soldier. Can't wait to see Infinity War, hope its just as good or better than Black Panther. BTW, going to see it a 4th time next weekend aka MOVIEPASS baby!","Black Panther",2313,4.1,-0.9
"2314",5,"  Black Panther is a thing of beauty. What's really satisfying is that it is visual story telling at its best, and in my mind, one of the most engrossing and thoughtful action films coming out from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that breathes deep characterizations, fresh conversations and envisions new directions. Black Panther is fresh, unique and deep. Although the representation may be African, set in a fictional nation in Africa called Wakanda, the script is nuanced, multi-layered and transcends cultures. Black Panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a film that has a brave, convincing and intelligent script which offers a two-hour escapism into a fantasy world. As you leave the theatre, you leave with hope to walk strong in a troubled world, and be inspired to believe in a better future. The ensemble cast is nothing short of amazing: everyone unique, beautiful and talented. Marvel seems to always get its casting so perfect for its cinematic universe: always finding that very actor for that very role, so much so you can't imagine the character being anyone else other than that actor: case in point, I can't imagine Chadwick Boseman not being the regal and noble King T'Challa. The audience would be able to find visual catharsis in the story, especially through any one of the character arcs, men or women. Women would be inspired and feel empowered by the strength of Queen Mother Ramonda, the leadership of General Okoye, the spunk and intelligence of the teenage Princess Shuri or the idealism and independence of Nakia. Without a doubt, the big bouquet goes to Ryan Coogler - for his direction and screenplay - which borrows too from biblical themes of redemption, forgiveness, sacrifice, death and resurrection, and Shakespearean settings. Not forgetting the crew, indeed a work of artistry and great passion. The sets are a pungent of colours and simply magnificent - especially the waterfall coronation scene. Even the costumes. The focus on detail is simply astonishing. Phew. Without leaving any spoilers, regarding the antagonist Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan delivers some of the best lines of the film - which brings chills down our spines when we weigh how easily smart young people today are being radicalised, and how thin the line is between good and evil when the world falls into the hands of anarchists and fascists completely deceived by their misguided sense of right and wrong. Clearly, this film is a step in the right direction for the wellness of the future in filmmaking. This is a milestone, and a gamechanger.","Black Panther",2314,4.1,-0.9
"2315",0.5,"  I am not a fan of most superhero movies, but I decided to see this one b/c of the hype. One of, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. I think it was made into tricking black people into thinking this is what they could've been had they not been colonized. Well, look no further than Liberia for evidence as to why that's false. Anyway, I won't be bringing my wife's son to see this again anytime soon. Peace.","Black Panther",2315,4.1,3.6

"2322",3.5,"  A solidly watchable but ultimately so-so comic book yarn, which fails to grab despite its best intentions. Chadwick Boseman is likeable but fails to exude the star charisma required for his central role, leaving the heavy lifting to the supporting cast, in particular Danai Gurira and Michael B.Jordan. Only towards the end does the film find its feet and step up the excitement and emotion. Worth seeing but below par compared the the series best.","Black Panther",2322,4.1,0.6

"2326",4,"  Wildly entertaining, brilliantly thought-provoking, and visually absolutely stunning, like any Black Panther solo movie ever has any rights to be... But still its not the ""be all to end all"" kind of ""greatest superhero movie of all-time"" that the whole world right now seems to be gushing about. Its most definitely not even a hundred miles near TDK or Spider-Man 2 or Iron Man (hell there's at least several other better entries in MCU itself!). Just my personal opinion: if you want a superbly crafted fulltoos fun enjoyable superhero movie this one is just that, if you're hyping it to be something much more than that then you'll probably be disappointed. I guess in the end it all depends if your skin color is black or not, which will likely give you an extra passion. 8.5 out of 10.","Black Panther",2326,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2328",2,"  The storyline was slow, weak and lacking interest. My 5 year old was already checking his watch for the time after 15 minutes into the film. It was not worth seeing in the theater but wouldn't be a bad watch on Netflix. The film isn't terrible but it's the worst so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","Black Panther",2328,4.1,2.1
"2329",5,"  One of my favorite Marvel movies. The design was nothing short of amazing. The characters were intense, and the chemistry was top notch. They managed to take a character I always considered a B-List character growing up and made their world amazing to venture into. The female characters in this movie were badass, without feeling shoe horned in for the demo checkbox. I really want to see more now, hope most of them make it out of the infinity war alive. Go see this movie at a good theater, it is an experience worthy of ticket price.","Black Panther",2329,4.1,-0.9

"2335",2.5,"  Reverse Mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king. Love the woke defense of anti-immigration policy. Friendly white guy is a CIA agent, who also gets drowned out by a sea of gorilla noises made by black people(who wrote this movie). Killmonger quoting Mein Kampf and attempting to Anschluss all the black people for his ethno-imperialist vision was a nice dichotomy to Wakanda doing nothing. What kind of racist was this movie pandering to? Wakanda is an Natsoc utopia. Make Wakanda Great Again.","Black Panther",2335,4.1,1.6

"2342",4,"  Black Panther is unlike any other Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film prior. It's unlike any other super hero film prior. Yes, there have been African-American leading men in comic-based movies, notably Wesley Snipes' half-vampire-all-badass Blade. However, this is the first movie I can think of with this kind of budget, this kind of backing, and with this kind of ownership over its cultural heritage and the heavy burdens it carries.We last saw T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in Captain America: Civil War mourning the loss of his father, the king of the African nation of Wakanda. The outside world does not know that Wakanda sits on a vast supply of virbanium, the strongest and more durable metal in the world and the key to Wakanda's impressive technology. Under a holographic cover, Wakanda is a thriving metropolis with flying cars, skyscrapers, and next gen weapons. T'Challa goes home and must earn the right to the throne. However, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), a former top-level black ops solider, is looking for his own path into Wakanda and onto the throne. Killmonger teams up with arms dealer, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis), to force Wakanda to deal with being cut off from the world.This is a movie populated almost entirely by black faces, notably black women (more on that later), and they are given a mainstream platform that celebrates its multitudinous African roots and traditions thanks to co-writer/director Ryan Coogler (Creed). This movie is proudly black, which will rankle some on the fringes of society, as if celebrating one's own identity is somehow denigrating those who do not apply to that status. Black Panther is not an exclusionary movie because of its content and execution; this is a very accessible movie to a mass audience, even those who haven't been paying attention to every nitty-gritty detail in the previous seventeen MCU entries. There are only two characters from other MCU films that appear, one as a post-credits cameo and the other an officious representative (Martin Freeman) of the outside's clandestine organizations. This is a unique world isolated from the long shadow of colonialism. Wakanda has never known, to our knowledge, the depravity of the European and American slave trade. They have continued to develop uninterrupted by conquerors, slave traders, and the crippling aftereffects of racism. The Wakanda people could very easily be the conquerors themselves. They're the most technologically advanced nation on the planet and hide as a ""third-world nation,"" utilizing the ignorance of the Western world to its security. The world of Wakanda is a fascinating, awe-inspiring, and defiantly independent nation.The larger theme is over the responsibilities inherent to those with privilege. The nation of Wakanda is vastly successful by all conventional metrics. T'Challa must wrestle with whether to continue their exclusionary stance, ignore the plight of the larger world and say it's none of their business or engage with the world, potentially putting his own kingdom's peace and prosperity at risk. It's a simple enough theme and yet it has tremendous weight to it especially when you account for those on the other end of the Wakanda borders. The character of Killmonger is a direct reflection of this. His experiences in Oakland are not the ideal pairing with the luxury of Wakanda. Killmonger sees Wakanda's great influence as a way to protect beleaguered black citizens of the world and especially in the United States. It's a way to prevent more senseless deaths from black citizens who were slain as a result of the fear of just being black (a powerful example was Coogler's debut film, Fruitvale Station). It's a pointed political statement that doesn't get too heavy-handed (even though I would have preferred that). It questions the value of isolationism especially when suffering can be prevented. Killmonger works as a villain because you can understand his point of view. He goes beyond the need for vengeance. The wrongs he wants to right are larger and historical. Even Killmonger's last line really attaches itself to this theme. T'Challa offers him a way out but with imprisonment. ""No,"" Killmonger declines, ""My people were the ones who leaped over the sides of the slave ships. They knew death was better than bondage."" The emphasis is ""his people,"" not T'Challa's, not Wakanda. His people were the ones who suffered from slavery. Could Wakanda have possibly prevented it?Another wonderful surprise of Black Panther is its incredible all-female ensemble that provides expert support to their king. T'Challa has the good fortune of four strong women, each of them having a different and vital relationship to him. The standout will be Danai Gurira (TV's Walking Dead) as the fierce chief of security, Okoye. She has a swagger that vacillates between being intimidating and being brashly enjoyable. Okoye has many of the best lines and she throws herself into every fight. There's also a sense of duty that transcends a single man that challenges her loyalty. Letitia Wright (TV's Humans) plays Shuri, the Q of this world, the top scientist and creator of many a gadget. She's T'Challa's little sister and their interplay is very competitive and teasing. She's looking to be more involved in the action and a highlight is when she teams up with her big bro. Lupita Nyong'o (The Jungle Book) is Nakia, a former flame of T'Challa's who comes in and out of his life as an undercover spy. All three of these women have a powerful sense of agency and are integrated in important and essential ways. Even though Nakia may slide into that romantic interest role, she still has a vibrant life outside whatever feelings she may or may not have for the hero. Then there's T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett), who radiates strength and fortitude. These women gave me some of the biggest moments of entertainment in the entire 135 minutes of movie.Now some careful readers might note that I haven't done much to emphasize the actual action of the super hero action movie, and that's for a good reason. Black Panther stands stronger on theme and character than it does its actual action sequences. Coogler had a wonderful sense of scale and verisimilitude with 2015's Creed, relying on long takes to put the audience in the heightened drama of the boxing ring. With Black Panther, the action sequences can lose a sense of immediacy. Many happen at night or are filmed and edited in ways that diminish some of their impact, like hand-to-hand combat in splashing water where the splashes obscure the activity. Other scenes felt like a video game CGI cut-scene. Speaking of video games, Black Panther's suit has a crazy ability to absorb the kinetic energy of weapons, which means the stakes take a dip when our hero can merely just stand and allow himself to get shot repeatedly. The payoff for this absorption is a giant energy shockwave but it plays out like a fighting game's special feature. It's an aspect that's not really utilized in a satisfying or unique way. The final showdown between Black Panther and Killmonger feels too weightless in execution. It's meant to even the playing field by nullifying their extra abilities, but if they both have the same ""Panther powers"" isn't the field already even? The third act, the usual punching bag for MCU critics, is the best part of the movie from an action standpoint. It utilizes the characters in significant ways and allows for organic complications while still maintaining its wider sense of spectacle. Plus it's one of the few action sequences that allow all the pyrotechnics to be enjoyed during the visibility of day.Boseman (Marshall) was an excellent choice for a stoic and too-cool-for-school character that can glide right on by. The ageless Boseman is at his best when he's working off the other actors, especially his female posse. He has a couple of very effective emotional confrontations as he learns of his family's secrets. As steady and soothing a presence as Boseman can be, this is Jordan's movie. Michael B. Jordan (Creed) has been Coogler's cinematic good luck charm and we're still benefiting from that divine kinship. His character is at the heart of the central thematic question. While T'Challa is ultimately the one who has to decide, it is Killmonger who embodies that need for change and the desire to rectify the past. There's a flashback with Jordan that got me to tear up, and this guy was the villain! It's one of the film's biggest mistakes sidelining Jordan for far too long. After his introduction, Killmonger is strangely absent for the next hour or so of the movie, ceding the spotlight to Serkis (War for the Planet of the Apes), a more antic and goofy scenery-chewing baddie who has a few regrettably ""faux hip"" lines of dialogue that land awkwardly. Serkis is having a blast but can feel like a holdover from a different film.Much like last summer's Wonder Woman, this is a movie that is going to mean a lot to a lot of people. It has a personal significance that I will not be able to fully tap into, no matter the expansive powers of empathy. Black Panther, as a long-awaited cultural moment, will have many ripples of inspiration. After my early screening, I sat back and watched an African-American boy, no older than seven or eight, walk out of the theater in a daze. His eyes were wide, his mouth agape, and he said in astonishment, ""That was the best movie ever."" That kid has a hero he can call his own. That matters. Black Panther, as a work of art, is rich in topical themes and has a wide supporting net of exciting, robust, and capable women. I enjoyed how personal and relevant and political the movie could become, folding new and challenging ideas onto the MCU formula. Coogler is a marvelous director and storyteller showing rare acumen for being able to handle the rigors of a Hollywood blockbuster and deliver something hearty. The action has some issues and there are some structural hiccups that hold it from the MCU's upper echelon (I enjoyed all of the 2017 MCU movies better). Black Panther is a winning movie when it features its sterling cast celebrating their virtues and solidarity and a still respectable enough action spectacle when called upon for big screen duty.Nate's Grade: B","Black Panther",2342,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2343",4,"  Boseman and Jordan are great, but make no mistake Ryan Coogler is the star of this movie. He directors some great action and really digs deep into this character. As someone who has been so inspired by superheroes I can't understate the importance of this movie, everyone deserves to see themself as a superhero.

"2344",4,"  I have next to no knowledge of this Marvel character...& I'm white...(gulp), this ought to be interesting...BLACK PANTHERAs I'm not versed in Pantherology, I can't compare anything. So you're getting this evaluation as a film alone, just a heads up. At about 2 & a half hours, this film takes it's time, & tells a solid, cohesive story that both entertains as a stand-alone film, & builds more of the Marvel universe it's a part of. The cast was awesome. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther still steals the show. As a reluctant king, you can really feel just how heavy his crown is, his unsure footing, he's clearly as terrified of screwing up as any of us would be in that situation. He has all the best strengths, and weaknesses, of the whole of humanity, and of course he never gives up, no matter how much easier it would be to do so. He reminds me of just how super the Marvel superheroes are. The villains were amazingly well balanced & layered. Andy Serkis as Claw was a bag full of crazy, clearly Ultron's injury left him brain damaged. Still, he was entertaining. The real main villain was Michael B. Jordan's character, he not only was your classic angry at the world bad guy, he had a good reason to be angry, he even grew sympathetic at the end, I really wish there were more characters with his depth. The rest of the cast was in top form, Panther's family, friends, rivals, & allies, were all able to come together, & really make this world look alive.This is my first trip to Wakanda, & it did not disappoint, it felt like I was looking at a lived in Afro-Atlantian culture, with a good balance of traditional Africa, & 25th century Earth. We got full frontal Africa on display, but it was respectful, the characters joked around a bit, but in a familial sense, the white characters weren't played for laughs or made to look stupid; the bit of PC here was done right.The effects, stunts, fights, & visuals were all done as practically as possible, with CGI used sparingly, & it really helped the film's believability.The music was a mix of tribal & modern, & it complemented the film nicely.This is a 4 star film all the way! Sorry Blade, sorry Steel, I love ya both, but when I think of a superhero for anyone to look up to, no matter the color, I'm now gonna think of Black Panther. This film has the best high points, low points, & everything in between.Wakanda forever!","Black Panther",2344,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2364",5,"  Epic movie with positive African and Black American representations! The women are AWESOME! Enjoy the uncolonized mind. Wakanda Forever!!","Black Panther",2364,4.1,-0.9
"2365",4,"  Gostei bastante...tem umas falhas...mas bem diferente dos filmes mais do mesmo de super heróis que estão dominando por aí....","Black Panther",2365,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2366",1,"  The race-related hype around this movie is so annoying that I don't even want to see it. The notion that it's an all black movie doesn't sit well with me either","Black Panther",2366,4.1,3.1
"2367",3.5,"  Critical acclaim and box office success have proved what was once a risky project undertaken by Marvel to take a non-white superhero onto the big screen is well and truly justified. With a briskly paced 134 minutes and timely cultural, racial and gender politics that refreshingly portrays African and female characters properly and positively, this is an entertaining film by co-writer/director Ryan Coogler that works amazingly well in a saturated market where the superhero genre has become formulaic and safe, even though, lest we forget, that this is essentially a black retread of narratives seen before in Thor and Iron Man; with a thankfully more contained and less explode-y finale that does not repeat mistakes of previous Marvel films. Another problem avoided is the bad villain syndrome, as Killmonger is a solidly written and motivated antagonist to our main hero - though he still does the predictable and soapy villain-y thing by not killing the hero outright when he can which ultimately precipitates his own demise. Slowed down combat scenes provide a cleaner and clearer look and the gadgets are inventive, but for a big budgeted Marvel film, I find it hard to overlook the two major fight scenes that take place over a watery arena that look jarringly obvious that they are shot in a green-screened studio and stand out like a sore thumb, especially compared to the excellently staged 'Busan Drift' car chase scene mid-film that has more location shots and looks much better and more convincing for it. Together with an excellent cast and an unconvoluted and smart standalone script that introduces characters and plotlines clearly and succinctly, the film's pros do outweigh its cons, and shows what more innovative ideas and risk-taking can do for the evolution and progress of this increasingly tired genre.","Black Panther",2367,4.1,0.6
"2368",5,"  Amazing and refreshing ! A true superhero film in every sense.","Black Panther",2368,4.1,-0.9
"2369",1,"  Well, I just wrote a long review for this and then posted it, or tried to, before logging in. I then logged in, hit ""post"" without noticing that my carefully written review was gone, and now have to write it all over again. So here we go, take two:Black Panther did not catch or hold my attention from the very first scene. Even the music over the black screen as it faded in had me thinking ""Uh-oh. Well, it will probably get much better, so we'll give it the benefit of the doubt"". It never did. Instead, like a late night re-run of ""The A-Team"", I felt like I could have slept through most of it without missing anything. To be blunt, I thought it was boring.Other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, particularly within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I disagree, but it isn't the only time I found myself on the opposite side of the fence with a Marvel movie.The first time it happened was with Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which I loved. It has things I don't like, but overall, I still enjoy that movie a great deal. The blend of music, cinematography, effects, and story, made me feel like I was watching the best of grand opera. But, it didn't perform well and the character was rebooted with Edward Norton playing Bruce Banner. I liked pretty much every scene that had Norton in it, but started disliking the movie when the Abomination was revealed as the villain. Not that I have anything against that villain, but I didn't like the way he was handled in that movie.More recently, I disliked all the political maneuvering in Civil War. Take that out, and I might have liked it. As it is, after seeing it more times than I care to admit, I still don't like it. Ragnarok was too jokey for my taste. Not that I don't like the humor in Marvel movies--usually I love it, but in Ragnarok, it made Thor the butt of every joke, and I didn't like that.The problem with Black Panther, at least, the problem I have with it, is that everyone connected to the film seems to have taken themselves so seriously that they stifled all the life from the film. It was like watching a DC movie, where the superheroes may as well be empty costumes for all the personality they have.Unlike others, I did not like Boseman as T'Challa, nor did I like him in ""Civil War"". It was one of the things that irritated me about the movie. Marvel has made some brilliant casting decisions, from Idris Elba as Heimdall, Chriss Pratt as Starlord, and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. How could they blow their streak of casting every Marvel superhero to date perfectly by giving us an actor who was so regal that the character lacked a personality and any discernible flaws?Add to this the claustrophobic sets, average cinematography, tedious story and editing, and the nonsensical mixture of tribal and futuristic culture, and this movie really falls apart.It was watchable in the sense that it didn't offend me (unlike ""the Manchurian Candidate remake, which I walked out on), but it could have been much more interesting if the filmmakers hadn't treated every aspect of this story like a Faberge egg they were afraid might break if they breathed too hard. The political content was sublimated more than expected, but it didn't bother me. I just wish they had let themselves cut loose and make something that was less safe.","Black Panther",2369,4.1,3.1
"2370",2.5,"  It wasn't good. Just wasn't. The memes. Oh the memes. The main character was boring. The villain was not good. The whole reason why the villain was a villain was so stupid. Andy Serkis was one of the only good characters and they kill him in the first 30 minutes. Vibranium is stupid now. After this film, every avenger should have a black panther suit. Theres no excuse now. How does wakanda work? Now really? Why are some of the people ok with living in huts and stuff, while the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city? But, even the hyper super duper citi, isn't that much hyper super. Why do they have a big main street with a market that looks like it was taken from a third world country? Why do they decide how is going to be king with a fight to the death? The cgi in the last fight scene between purple black panther and golden black panther is really bad.Really not a good movie and it creates a big number of problems for all the other films in this universe. Some of it was enjoyable, but then they had to talk about memes, or call someone a whiteboy, or a colonizer. Oh and if you need to do something, like stop a car, or save someone who was shot in the spine, or just have a holo-chat with your friend, you can use these super futuristic hyper technical vibranium balls that everyone wears as a bracelet. Yeah, just stick it in his spine and he is all fixed up. Who-hu. ugh.And I'm not even gonna talk about how the villain's plan to take over wakanda is just plain stupid for no good reason. Other than, oh hey, let's have him kill this dude, and then be totally badass in a fight with the hero.Ok, that's enough. It's not good. Don't go see it.","Black Panther",2370,4.1,1.6
"2371",2.5,"  Not the best marvel movie ever. Got rave reviews for having a mainly black cast and I get that it's awesome but what do you expect from a film set in a fictional African country? The film was good but not great. It was a big repetitve loop with no sirprises. The final fight scene reminded me of the one in Star wars the phantom menace...","Black Panther",2371,4.1,1.6
"2372",3,"  If you put the political baggage aside, I think Black Panther is good. The pacing, lack of development, predictability and poor CGI prevent it from being perfect, but overall it is enjoyable and worth watching if you're a Marvel fan. To quote RedLetterMedia: ""it was alright.""","Black Panther",2372,4.1,1.1
"2373",3.5,"  Well it looks like Rotten tomatoes has finally let me type my review on this movie I seen the movie the day it came out. I enjoyed Black Panther I thought the storyline line was good the film looked amazing you can tell everyone involved with this movie worked hard to make this a success. Marvel knows when to gamble and when not to and it almost always pays off. Now what dose have me just a little concerned is it seems like they put so much into this movie can they come back with a second movie and it be just as good. Black Panther has alot of different storylines to make a second movie like teaming up with the Fantastic Four or marrying Storm from Xmen or they could show make a movie about Mephisto tricking Nakia into turning her back on Black Panther so their is a few places they can go if their willing to do so cause it won't be cheap. So If you have enjoyed the Marvel movies so far Black Panther won't let you down.","Black Panther",2373,4.1,0.6
"2374",4,"  I enjoyed the movie and it is certainly one of the better Marvel films but it is not the greatest Marvel movie that the critics would have you believe. The origin story is good but goes on a bit too long. There also not enough of the Black Panther doing his thing. Virtually no reference to any of the Avengers so it feels more like a standalone movie. Winter Soldier Doctor Strange and Ragnorok rank higher imo.","Black Panther",2374,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2375",5,"  Amazing movie! Definitely a must see.","Black Panther",2375,4.1,-0.9
"2376",1.5,"  Black panther can be an interesting superhero, but in this movie he is a male Mary Sue charecter with an equally boring plot. The Action scenes were boring, and the protagonists felt like villains with the actual villain being the only interesting character in the movie. Other than that there were a few other things in the movie I disliked, like the race-baiting jokes like ""And who are you, the colonizer"" and the special effects being cartoony or unrealistic. Overall, this movie was a disappointment considering I wanted to see it, and ending up watching a boring and rushed movie","Black Panther",2376,4.1,2.6
"2377",5,"  My favourite Marvel film so far, excellent story, all characters were fleshed out properly in my opinion, with what I would deem to be the second best MCU villain","Black Panther",2377,4.1,-0.9
"2378",1.5,"  Mediocre story with awful acting packaged in an atrocious screenplay attached with so called hard hitting political dialogues - I am out of bad lingo in my dictionary describing this worst Marvel movie ever made. The only grace being Letitia and Lupita's warm portrayal of plastic characters. Ohh I forgot to mention that I have heard snoring for the first time in a movie screening.","Black Panther",2378,4.1,2.6
"2379",5,"  Beautiful movie with a lot your can get from it as far as lessons on family, culture and more. A slight knock because of the CG, but the story line makes up for it greatly. This movie has very relate-able characters and will movie you. Many people will see themselves on the screen","Black Panther",2379,4.1,-0.9
"2380",5,"  It was amazing i loved how we got to see such amazing technology but one thing i didn't really like was how there was just so much instant death","Black Panther",2380,4.1,-0.9
"2381",5,"  Black Panther ! divine, sweet smelling, fragrant, aromatic","Black Panther",2381,4.1,-0.9
"2382",2.5,"  why do the critics automatically 'grade with a curve' on black/lgbt movies.....this was an ok movie at best...certainly not a 97%...to give it that only cheapens the credibility of all reviews by them......nor did I find the special effects 'high schoolish' as Medved claims....it would have been a much more enjoyable movie if they had left out the race baiting bs.......they racial animosity by the characters was over the top","Black Panther",2382,4.1,1.6
"2383",5,"  At first I had no desire to see this movie and that it was only being hyped because it was Marvel and had a predominately black cast. I finally decided to check out the movie to see what the hype was about and I loved it! The action,actors, soundtrack and fx were awesome. Probably going to buy the dvd. Glad I checked it out. So far my favorite movie of 2018!","Black Panther",2383,4.1,-0.9
"2384",2.5,"  Much like the Last Jedi, the reviews on this movie are 100% wrong. The movie itself was ok, special effects were below average as was the story. As marvel movies go, it doesn't crack the top 10. As the characters go, Killmonger was pretty lame, the only characters that really stood out were Klaue, the princess and M'Baku. I don't want to give away the plot but if you're on the ropes about seeing this movie, wait for video, it definitely doesn't live up to the hype.","Black Panther",2384,4.1,1.6
"2385",4.5,"  1978-Superman.....1989-Batman......2004-Spider-Man 2.......2008-The Dark Night......2017-Logan......2018......BLACK PANTHER. Black Panther is honest to god, one of the best superhero movies ever made. Everything about this movie just worked. This movie has been getting a lot of hype, as well as a lot of hate, and going in, I was hesitant. Getting to excited about movies like this can lead to disappointment, which can really suck. This movie is not disappointing, this movie is exceptional. Ryan Coogler brings his all to this film, and it shows. Just like Creed, his love for long take fights shows through an incredible casino tracking shot. The best thing about this movie is the characters. We all have been hearing about how amazing Michael B. Jorden is in the movie, and I can say that they are right, damn right. He is by far the best MCU villain. I don't really want to give anymore away, so all I'll say is that this is a near perfect movie, and I god damn loved it","Black Panther",2385,4.1,-0.4
"2386",0.5,"  Meh, at best. The CGI was obvious and reminded me of Tobey McGuire's Spider-Man. The plot is the basic boring format that all of these movie have become. And the comedy was just a cringe-fest. Not to mention that T'Challa is boring and uninteresting. Killmonger could have been interesting, but instead he became the generic revenge villain. All in all, a failure for Marvel, I'd say.","Black Panther",2386,4.1,3.6
"2387",3,"  Black Panther stumbles a little bit out of the gate, but picks itself up around the halfway mark and finishes strong. Once the villain's motivation becomes clear, the Black Panther becomes the most thought provoking MCU movie yet, despite being a little sloppy in execution.","Black Panther",2387,4.1,1.1
"2388",0.5,"  What is everybody talking about. This movie was horrible! Corny, predictable, very slow moving for the first hour....and the hidden agenda in the movie was not hidden much....if at all. I think this movie is getting the high rating it has based more on political factors than the quality of the movie.","Black Panther",2388,4.1,3.6

"2394",4.5,"  It may not take any risks in the technical aspects, except for costume design, but Ryan Coogler's effort succeeds within the MCU thanks to its effective ""Godfather-meets-James-Bond"" kind of story, great action scenes, dazzling tribal imagery and magnificent performances by its mostly black cast, especially those by Chadwick Boseman, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis and Michael B. Jordan. Moreover, this film is an outstanding honor to African American society while still maintaining a sense of universality and delivers a critique on America's superiority complex while also asking for true brotherhood with the other nations. For all these reasons, ""Black Panther"" matters.","Black Panther",2394,4.1,-0.4

"2403",0.5,"  shitty racist movie................................","Black Panther",2403,4.1,3.6
"2404",4,"  Black Panther is a new, bold direction for action/superhero films; it is like a unique immersion into the African/fictional Wakandan culture which is best displayed in its ""afrofuturistic"" potential. This film takes interesting steps by exploring political and socially relevant issues regarding race, culture, and a sense of identity; people of color are also represented in a more positive light. Despite some problems with poor pacing, lack of great action, and bloated CGI, Black Panther fulfills expectations by delivering wonderful production design, colorful costumes, Shakesperean-esque drama, solid characters, and a substantial narrative.","Black Panther",2404,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2405",0.5,"  This movie is overrated af. Not even top 5 marvel mcu. So boring. CGI is terrible and doesnt look natural. Save your money movie is overhyped","Black Panther",2405,4.1,3.6
"2406",3.5,"  Most likely an unpopular opinion: great superhero film, but not much else. Slow start to the film and sped up too fast near the end. Killmonger enters Wakanda and has himself a duel and the throne within 10 minutes? Then he loses the battle and dies without much drama even though his whole life had revolved around finding and taking over Wakanda. Regardless of the flaws, it was a delight to see almost an all-black cast with strong and witty performances all around. The cinematography was on point as was the music. Would definitely recommend, but does not live up to the hype coming out of the US","Black Panther",2406,4.1,0.6
"2407",2.5,"  Disappointing! Black Panther has been a favorite character since I started collecting comics 40 years ago and really hoped for success on the big screen. Major plot holes, downright bad CGI in several scenes, and unnecessary political themes. This movie was better than anything DC/WB has produced but as far as Marvel goes did not meet expectations. Blade 1 & 2 were better.","Black Panther",2407,4.1,1.6
"2408",4,"  A good, worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic universe. It is slightly overrated and contains a major plot hole that just feels like lazy writing. But nonetheless, a decent movie","Black Panther",2408,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2414",3,"  It was alright. Not great, but not terrible. Spent too much time on the pointless or political and not enough time spent being a superhero. While it might have a cultural signifigance, I found my eyes rolling more than once over some obvious and out-of-place digs and the bad guys were the best part of the film by far. Scar was energetic and just entertaining to watch, and his screentime was fun and actually entertaining. Killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get too much and was kind of an arse, he was still a fairly believable bad guy and person. Overall I wouldn't rush to theaters to see it, but if your local movie place has it as a cheap rental I'd consider picking it up. Here's hoping Black Panther gets to really show off his claws in another, better, movie.","Black Panther",2414,4.1,1.1
"2415",5,"  outstanding, movie of the year!","Black Panther",2415,4.1,-0.9
"2416",4,"  All together, Black Panther is a strong film and one of the best MCU movies to date. The strongest elements of the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of Wakanda. Chadwick Boseman is incredible as the lead and easily one of the most relatable and best heroes of the MCU. The story focuses more on his struggles trying to lead a kingdom rather than being a perfect superhero, relying too much in his powers. This makes him very relatable to the audience. The same goes for Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, who is arguably the greatest MCU villain to date. Killmonger is one of the best aspects of the film; however, his screen time is limited compared to what it could have been. The rest of the cast also put in top performances, specifically Andy Serkis, Florence Kasumba, and Letitia Wright. Although the movie is solid overall, it still has its flaws despite the massive hype and expectations. The action sequences are often weak and the CGI is poor at times. This is specifically noticeable in the final fight. The fight between Killmonger and Black Panther is fought in a dark setting, so it can be difficult to see the action. Also, the large scale fight is underwhelming with Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi constantly switching sides not making much sense and feeling necessary only for the fight to happen. The second half of the movie can feel a little rushed too. Despite these drawbacks, the overall story and connectable and strong characters make up for the flaws. Black Panther is an enjoyable movie and a solid entry into the world of Wakanda and Black Panther.","Black Panther",2416,4.1,0.0999999999999996

Well done marvel and director Ryan Coogler you guys made a very well crafted and fun superhero film ever and black panther is my favorite superhero because he knows how to rule a country and he is a king for god sake's and I like that. Good job and well done best superhero film of 2018 can wait for infinity war and that one is going to be the best one and they save the best one for last. Black panther welcome to the family.

The movie doesn't have to be completely realistic, but there is a fine line between what is okay when it comes to being unrealistic and being downright insane. It was boring, the visuals were dull, and there weren't any good sound effects. If you want to waste your time, here's the movie for you!","Black Panther",2425,4.1,3.1
"2426",3,"  After watching Annihilation, this movie rocked! Excellent acting by all actors. Loved seeing a few LOTOR alumni, walking dead Michonne actress kicking ass, and the story was well played out and action packed of course. By no means a Guardians of the Galaxy or Iron Man caliber but still very entertaining.","Black Panther",2426,4.1,1.1
"2427",4,"  Very fun and splendidly acted action flick. Highly recommend.","Black Panther",2427,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2428",4.5,"  Black Panther is easily one of the most talked about movies in recent memory. A lot of it stems from the fact that it's (debatably) the first mainstream blockbuster to have a predominantly Black cast, and also the first that deals with issues affecting Black people around the world. For a lot of people, this was more than just a movie. It was a cultural moment. That's completely understandable, given Hollywood's history of racism and underrepresentation. Black Panther broke all sorts of records, and reeled in over $200,000,000 opening weekend, in the U.S. alone. It's really making its mark, and for good reason.It also helps that it's one of Marvel's best. After T'Challa (Black Panther) stole the show in Civil War, people were excited to see him in a story of his own. In this movie, he has become the king of Wakanda, an African nation that mines Vibranium (the stuff Captain America's shield is made of) to create extraordinary technology but disguises itself as an impoverished, third world country. T'Challa is conflicted about whether he should continue allowing Wakanda to thrive as an isolationist country or if he should use its wealth and technology to benefit the rest of the world. He begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be when the throne is challenged by Killmonger, a soldier who seeks to start worldwide uprising and bring it all under Wakanda. Killmonger was easily one of the best villains in the MCU, if not the best overall. He has a charismatic and patient side, but also a violent and aggressive side. Without giving too much away, his last on-screen appearance was a very good scene. The other characters were also pretty good. Shuri was fun to watch with all her technology. Okoye had some great fight scenes. Ross was a good comic relief. M'Baku was a good character. Andy Serkis is one of the best actors to play a villain. The list goes on. One of the best things about the movie is the way it builds the world. You don't need to be familiar with the comics to understand Wakanda, and its people, culture, and traditions are shown in great detail, making it fascinating to watch. Wakanda is beautiful, the people, the landscape, and the futuristic cityscape. It also helps that the movie's soundtrack, which ranges from traditional African music to orchestral movie music to rap and hip-hop, is absolutely fantastic. The blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film, with the combat shown ranging from swordfights to aerial battles that look like they're right out of Star Wars. The rituals shown involving T'Challa's coronation were great. He participates in ritual combat, and talks to his deceased father in the Ancestral Plane, which reminds me of The Lion King. That's actually a downside to the film, without giving too much away, it's strikingly similar to The Lion King in several different ways, not just because it's set in Africa. Black Panther still does it very well, though. The people show the different cultures of Wakanda, which are based on real African cultures. There are articles online that document the real life inspiration behind some of Black Panther's imagery, which are really great reads.In conclusion, Black Panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of memorable characters, an amazing world and culture within its setting, and a great albeit familiar story. This movie meant a lot for many people, and it was an absolute pleasure to see on the big screen. This one is very highly recommended.","Black Panther",2428,4.1,-0.4
"2429",5,"  Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!","Black Panther",2429,4.1,-0.9
"2430",4.5,"  Was a good movie, but don't go seeing it believing the ""best ever hype"" because of the best Marvel DC movies, each one has aspects that are better and worse than the others. I'd say it's on par with Home Coming / Civil War / Wonder Woman / Ragnarok , but by no means are any of them ""the best"". It was a good movie, with good characters, a good story, and a wonderful take on the MCU world we've not seen yet. The villain was probably the most stand out part.","Black Panther",2430,4.1,-0.4
"2431",5,"  Enjoyed the elements Marvel added. The villain was great.","Black Panther",2431,4.1,-0.9
"2432",0.5,"  I attempted to leave a review of this on the 23rd. For the next four days, I could see no reviews. Now reviews are showing. This movie is about as anti-American and insulting to black Americans as any I've seen. It suggests that blacks in the US are so pathetic as to be unable to do anything for themselves, and that America is so lacking that spaceship flying Africans have to bring aid to help them. It is anti-capitalist. It presents a society in the middle of Africa that looks like any US city with US type tastes and activities and language. The only thing African about it is the superficial dress and kitsch hanging on stalls. It's insulting to Africans. It suggests that blacks all over the world are somehow linked to one another when the opening sequence contains blacks enslaving blacks, killing blacks, and separated into multiple factions. It's a mass of contradictions, trite superficial observations, and leftist drivel. I strongly advise against seeing it.","Black Panther",2432,4.1,3.6
"2433",3.5,"  Overall a pretty good effort, but Guardians is still tops!","Black Panther",2433,4.1,0.6
"2434",5,"  I will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the movies still. In my opinion the gender roles are very balance. I didn't see anything involving racism like some people trying to make it look. You always have those who find bad things about any movie and even cartoons.  I think is a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are. When I went to see this movie the audience was very diverse and people applaud at the end of the movie. You don't see this kind of people's reaction for a movie that much nowadays. When they show women warriors in this movie, they were not kidding. They have some nice martial arts skills. Coming from a person who has done martial arts and involve with different styles since the 80's.","Black Panther",2434,4.1,-0.9
"2435",4,"  Marvel superhero film with most diverse and greatest depth of characters across good and evil. A lot of layers making one care about heroes and villains and the grey areas in between. Strong male and female characters and each with their own story arc and struggle to overcome.","Black Panther",2435,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2436",5,"  Awesome movie. Saw it twice. Headed back for a third viewing.","Black Panther",2436,4.1,-0.9
"2437",3,"  Watched it this past weekend with my wife and two children.I thought it was okay, but I don't see how this movie is seen as groundbreaking. Like almost all Marvel movies, the villain died relatively easily, nobody got hurt and things went according to plan. There was the obligatory fighting-falling scene right out The Matrix. No Way was this better than Ironman, Ironman 3, Winter Soldier, Ant Man, Civil War. This was right with Spider-Man Homecoming. It was okay, but you don't leave the theatre with strong emotions.","Black Panther",2437,4.1,1.1

"2440",1,"  The last two superhero movies I enjoyed were Deadpool and (if you relax the definition a bit) The Last Jedi. The genre just does nothing for me. I had high-hopes for this film--given the stellar reviews it's been getting. My reaction to this film was almost identical to another highly-regarded superhero movie: Wonderwoman. But, as with that film, 30 minutes in, and I was done. The costumes and production design were quite creative, but I had zero emotional investment in any of the characters. How can you possibly sit thru a story where you don't FEEL anything (except bored and antsy)? At the half-hour mark I went into the lobby to ask about refund/re-admission policy and they (to their credit) cheerfully refunded my money. If superhero movies aren't your thing, I'd strongly advise you skip this one, too.","Black Panther",2440,4.1,3.1
"2441",5,"  This movie was pure perfection! The cinematography, the story, the acting, the music, EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!!! I am waiting for the moment I can go back and watch it again!!!","Black Panther",2441,4.1,-0.9
"2442",5,"  Black Panther is great with a great hero played by Chadwick Boseman and giving us MCU version of Klaw but the best part of the movie is Michael B. Jordan kill-monger was very different from most MCU villains with better motives than other MCU bad guys to Kill-Monger was the best part of this movie. Black Panther is one of the best Marvel movies its a great movie 10/10","Black Panther",2442,4.1,-0.9
"2443",5,"  Black Panther is Marvel's answer to DC's The Dark Knight. Pairing a complex hero with an equally relatable antagonist that create a very dynamic protagonist-antagonist relationship.","Black Panther",2443,4.1,-0.9
"2444",2,"  A star-studded special-effects extravaganza, ruined by numerous plot holes and by making Wakanda into Donald Trump's wet dream (only with black people). Relies mostly on moving so fast that you have no time to realize how nonsensical or racist it is (really? black people HOOTING like apes, and doing it PROUDLY because they're doing it at a white guy?). Two stars, strictly for SFX, acting quality and direction, in that order.","Black Panther",2444,4.1,2.1
"2445",2,"  It was alright. I don't get all of the hype.","Black Panther",2445,4.1,2.1
"2446",4.5,"  Black Panther elevates superhero movies to a new level beyond expectations telling one of the MCU'S best and most absorbing stories. The performances from the whole cast are great playing some of the MCU's most realized and well thought out characters. Overall, the stories and characters are something even non-superhero fans can enjoy.","Black Panther",2446,4.1,-0.4

"2454",0.5,"  Wow worst movie I have ever seen. Will be forgotten and filed under ""overrated super hero crap"".","Black Panther",2454,4.1,3.6
"2455",3.5,"  Its decent Marvel fare though nothing spectacular. Standard formula set in Africa instead of Asgaard say. Michael B Jordan's character put a bit of a spin on the villain though I wish there was more of Andy Serkis's Klaue. Supporting cast forgettable though. Very noticeably PG-13 film with some of the deaths and lack of blood with one death in particular. Premise of Wakanda is absurd of course but it being a comic book film I'll give it a quick eye roll and accept it.","Black Panther",2455,4.1,0.6
"2456",5,"  Great movie! Loved the story line and the characters. Definitely a recommendation to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.","Black Panther",2456,4.1,-0.9
"2457",4.5,"  Marvel's most satisfying and authentic origin story. Full review soon. Rating: 87","Black Panther",2457,4.1,-0.4
"2458",1,"  First time through, it was great, but they dont deliver a believable advanced society. Most of the technology is more superfluous junk like we already have, and its nothing Stark couldnt manage.","Black Panther",2458,4.1,3.1
"2459",5,"  Black Panther is honestly one of the greatest superhero movies of all times, and the greatest solo superhero movie since Wonder Woman. The cast, specifically Chadwick Boseman, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan, provides such strong performances.","Black Panther",2459,4.1,-0.9
"2460",5,"  The story was pretty generic; prince becomes king, loses crown, has to fight to win it back. It is the subtext that really shines; what is man's duty to help others, and what is the cost? And the women are empowered in this movie; nice to see!","Black Panther",2460,4.1,-0.9
"2461",2,"  rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the hype and the disappointment was insurmountable to the hype it lived up to.","Black Panther",2461,4.1,2.1
"2462",5,"  Just an ALL AROUND AMAZING MOVIE! Killmonger had you wondering if you should be believing in his measage or black panther's!!! Well casted and amazing writing.","Black Panther",2462,4.1,-0.9
"2463",1,"  This movie was very over-hyped and under-delivered. The two main villains were more interesting than the movies heroes. I enjoyed the movies scenery but was very disappointed with the fight scenes compared with past Marvel movies.","Black Panther",2463,4.1,3.1
"2464",4,"  Visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best origin films since the original Iron Man. Michael B Jordan stuns as the villain, though he could have done more if he wanted to go down as one of the all time great villains.","Black Panther",2464,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2468",5,"  Black Panther - it's been a long time coming, but was worth the wait. Insightful, funny, and all the glamour of a super hero movie.","Black Panther",2468,4.1,-0.9
"2469",3.5,"  A good Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Not the best, definitely not the worst. Casting and acting were great - the actors did a spectacular job of bringing their characters to life and everyone seemed to get a good amount of screen time. Chadwick Boseman really brought T'Challa to life, as did Michael Jordan with Killmonger who I felt could have used a little more screen-time. Letitia Wright gets a special shout-out here for bringing just enough humor and lightheartedness to the movie to keep it lively.Action scenes were great - no surprise there but the best action scene is probably the car-chase that happens mid-movie. The big scene at the end suffers a bit from too many simultaneous things happening at once and thus, too many cuts and jumps from one battle to another. The effects were spot on and some of Marvels best, especially the aerial craft and Wakanda scenes. Exception to this was the creatures, like the battle-rhinos, which screamed CGI in that bad way. The pacing was good - I never had the feeling I was getting bored or the movie was stalling, and I didn't have the feeling it was moving too fast to me to keep up with it. Cinematography is average to good with no fancy camera angles or tricks to write home about. Sound and music the same. No scenes stand out that I'll remember a year from now based on any of these alone unlike Andy Dufrane's escape from Shawshank Prison or the quiet hum of Darth Vader's lightsaber as he's standing in the corridor waiting for Obi-wan Kenobi.The writing - mediocre. I think they could have told a better story for Black Panther rather than creating a Marvel version of ""The Lion King"" - Young king who is inexperienced and unsure of himself who has to suddenly take over the kingdom. Spiritual advice from his deceased father during vision quest. Primary antagonist is his unc..actually, cousin in this one, who is wildly unpopular among the people of this utopia; which still handles matters of succession not by democracy or any kind of elect system, but through ritual bloodsport of the strongest. It's usually in the writing that Marvel Cinematic Universe movies do good or bad in with few exceptions. Overall, Black Panther was good, not great. It's not ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1"" great or ""Ironman"" great or ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" great and it has it's flaws but most of Marvel's CU lineup does. Why the paid critics choose to give it such high marks is beyond me, and I expect some of it is due to internal politics and not their love of movies. When you rank the Marvel lineup by audience score, you see a different picture which puts Black Panther in the middle of the pack where I feel is more appropriate for what I saw on the screen. I haven't seen a ""bad"" Marvel Cinematic Universe movie yet and when Black Panther's sequel comes out, I'll be picking up my ticket again opening night.","Black Panther",2469,4.1,0.6

"2474",4,"  Black Panther is above all, a solid film that ranks among the top tier of Marvel films. What holds it back from being truly transcendent of its genre is the tonal dichotomy that never quite works. Black Panther can't quick decide if it wants to be an intimate, cultural opus or a flashy, revolutionary tale and suffers ever so slightly for trying to be both. An important film none-the-less, Black Panther is undoubtedly a success.","Black Panther",2474,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2475",5,"  Breathtaking, Revolutionary, Stunning","Black Panther",2475,4.1,-0.9
"2476",2.5,"  I found many aspects of Black Panther to be copied from other Marvel films such as the Thor Trilogy such as dream sequence where both Thor & T'Challa interact with late fathers etc. Also Similar to Thors brother Loki assuming command of Asgard after Thors fall from grace similar to T'Challa's cousin assuming command of Wakanda after his fall from grace!Then we have T'Challa reluctantly on both parts teaming up with an outcast tribe similar to Thor teaming up with Loki & rebels to save Asgardians.Then we have T'Challa having secret relation due to his uncle having a kid who returns home after the old ruler of Wakanda dies to claim the throne just like in Thor 3 when Odin dies, Hela comes along & does the exact same thing!I even saw similarities between Thors Asgard protector Heimdal & Black Panthers Wakanda protector Okoye... both loyal to royal blood line!Had I not have seen & loved Thor films then I would have been blown away by Black Panther!","Black Panther",2476,4.1,1.6
"2477",5,"  Easily Marvel's best film. Black Panther represents what can happen when you use the comic book genre for more than just a battle with a generic villain bent on destroying or ruling the world. The actors are fantastic and with a film full of characters none feel two-dimensional. The director adeptly juggles the characters so that each one feels defined in spite of the limits of time. This film is groundbreaking on so many levels and marks a milestone for Marvel. The love those who created this film had for the material shines through in every minute of the film.Wakanda forever!","Black Panther",2477,4.1,-0.9
"2478",2.5,"  After all the hype everywhere, and a 100% rating on RT, I was expecting something truly epic, with a side dish of liberal BS as seems to be the case everywhere these days. What I got instead was a typical, completely predictable Marvel Trope. Honestly, not as much liberal BS as I was expecting. The movie kinda delves into the origins of Black Panthers, why they wanted their fictional country of Wakanda ot stay hidden, and fair enough, the motivations of both sides are understandable, and you can empathize with both sides. Where the movie fails completely is execution. There is only maybe 10-15 minutes of decent action, and maybe another 15 mins of completely ridiculous ""Godzilla"" style fights where the viewer is not emotionally invested at all. *spoiler alert* Both antagonists and protagonists wear a pretty much indestructible suit, and proceed to punch the crap out of each other, but in the end, everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy. Pluses: The sister of the king is fairly enjoyable to watch, she has some decent one liners, some jokes:""What are THOOOSE?!"" fall a bit flat, but maybe that's just because of the current meme culture, where something is extremely funny for a week, and then immediately dated and old. The inevitable political BS: Honestly, not as much as I expected. Sure, 95% of characters are black. Well, sure, it's a movie set in Africa, what did you expect? But as far as pushing any kind of propaganda, I didn't see almost any of it. They just wanted to make a movie about Black Panther, they just didn't make it all that interesting. The last 30-40 mins of the movie I was seriously considering leaving the theater, because you knew exactly what was going to happen. Overall, I'd say 2.5/5","Black Panther",2478,4.1,1.6
"2479",5,"  Pure fun. This movie raises the bar for super hero films. Great story, believable character development, and fantastic villains.

Most of the movie I was just wondering if it was almost over. I thought the entire movie was very forgettable other than the talented Letitia Wright, whose role as the female sister heroine 'Q' type gadget guru saved the film. Michael B.

The villain is interesting for a while, but it turns out he's just a one-dimensional radical, while the hero is a one-dimensional good-because-he-is-good guy.

"2494",1.5,"  this was a really bad movie. I was so disappointed in this movie that I wanted a refund after I saw the movie.","Black Panther",2494,4.1,2.6
"2495",3,"  You can say what you will of the several decades long Marvel cinematic franchise, but one thing you can't say it is not is ""average"". Marvel and subsequent owners Disney have constructed a Michelin 3-star bivouac of action movie tent poles in which to house the American collective unconscious. These are movies that are guaranteed to give you a chuckle, a thrill, maybe a chill, but you certainly won't be leaving the theater any more or less enlightened than when you walked in. This makes the franchise the pinnacle of what ""esteemed"" American director Paul S. W. Anderson calls ""populist film making"". In that aspect, Black Panther undoubtedly joins the ranks of the franchise's finest, like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Howard the Duck.""It's popular ergo it's good"" is a statement one would attribute to flawed logic. Just look at the Fast and Furious, Resident Evil, and Transformers franchises. Please don't misunderstand me here; this movie doesn't even come close to stooping to that level of crapola mediocrity. It is killing at the box office not only because it hardly has anything to compete with, but, on a technical level, it checks all of the boxes. Lucky for Marvel Disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype and accolades, but as I hope to make a bit clearer, there is something very tainted surrounding Black Panther, a conflict lying hidden within the deeper layers of the film. You could see it as a profound commentary on American society, an ingenious marketing ploy, or something antithetical to the filmmakers' philosophical aspirations.In the most indefatigable subtext, Black Panther is a story of the Black people working against their oppressors, within and outside - told by Ryan Coogler, an African American, a Black man, a Black director working in a very white Hollywood, within a literary world crafted by and serving a primarily white audience. As the box office numbers will attest, this is an intellectual (and, more importantly for white people, financial) coup for every facet of mainstream movie making. This is the mold-breaker of tokenism. Not only does it fulfill all vicarious expectations that would be required of white action, adventure, and fantasy tropes for a Black audience, but it makes those same tropes accessible, adoptable, and funky fresh for white audiences. You think the main villain is Andy Serkis? Bam! He's a Macguffin villain. You think Martin Freeman is a necessary character with agency? Bam! He's a Macguffin white savior of absolutely no consequence except to be window dressing for the Black power utopia.On the other side of the political aisle, Black Panther gives white nationalists all the vitriolic virtue signaling that they detest Hollywood for in the first place. The soundtrack is primarily African rhythms and hip-hop, and every major character is Black and indestructible. The major nationalistic debate of the fictional nation Wakanda is isolationism versus jingoistic, world-policing presumptions and condescension (that could in some perplexing esoteric context be mistaken for a parallel to American military interventionism). The final conflict ultimately comes down to Black on Black violence only reinforcing the presupposition that, absent the white man, none can bring a better homeostasis to our global economy, especially when a Utopian Black society is reduced to hand to hand combat via electromagnetic, neon nano-tech versus alloy-armored GMO rhinoceroses.Like so many movies, it all comes down to what you brought in with you to cinema. Are you ready to fight the man, or do you just want to shut your brain off? Or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that the mainstream media is a farce, dictating to the world what the powers that be think you need to think, yet never back up in any sort of sociopolitical policy outside of the cinema? Black Panther has it all folks. It's everything you want and not. It's so average that it transcends the amalgamation of all genres it inhabits. Truth be told, I yawned a lot, but it's good food for thought...and Hollywood inches ever closer to a satisfactory ""intersectional, progressive values"" to profit ratio.","Black Panther",2495,4.1,1.1
"2496",4,"  It's a good film, much better than Thor Ragnarok or Spiderman Homecoming. It's not reduced to a comedy film like Thor Ragnarok. Chadwick Boseman is awesome as T'Challa, also Michael B Jordan & other actors did a great job. It's filled with high octane action, great VFX & a good storyline.

"2502",4,"  Having always been a fan of the Pink Panther movies I was interested to see this new spin off. However, imagine my disappointment when I discovered it wasn't a slapstick heist / police detective movie but another addition to the ever expanding Marvel Universe! Once I got over my initial disappointment I found myself enjoying the story that began in Civil War where Black Panther was first introduced. Unlike other characters in the Marvel cinematic universe, this is a character I knew very little about and the film makers have done a decent job creating his back story as well as linking it with the central villain of the piece who was played well by Michael B. Jordan. The side villain Ulysses Klaue played by Andy Serkis was considered a little over the top by some but I enjoyed his performance and thought he played a suitably manic villain. The cast as a whole can not be faulted, there were some exciting set pieces, especially the car chase through the South Korea and a very decent story. At some point Marvel will run out of steam but they show no signs of slowing down yet and are still bringing interesting and exciting characters to the big and small screens.I think this current Marvel run will end or at least change somewhat after the events of Infinity War, I'm interested to find out if I am still enjoying their films afterwards.","Black Panther",2502,4.1,0.0999999999999996

This isn't your typical superhero movie, in fact I would hesitate to even call it a superhero movie since it mostly centers around a conflict confined to one country. The action scenes are really cool and all of the characters and villains are really interesting. They also did a great job with all stunning and beautiful settings. This movie is very colorful and uses many diverse styles of architecture that really draw you into the movie. If there was anything I didn't like about the movie it was that it moved a little to fast in the beginning for my tastes and some of the typical disney/marvel brand humor moderately disrupted the flow at times.Now of course a movie like this is going to have some political themes as well (I mean it's BLACK PANTHER for God's sake) which speaking as someone who's moderately conservative and voted for Trump, I think they couldn't have done a better job! The movie actually started off surprisingly pro right-wing, emphasizing the importance of isolationism and displaying very socially conservative/traditionalist themes. Of course the movie's politics slowly shift more towards black power, which was satisfyingly not like the typical left-wing, victimhood, virtue-signaling that most overly progressive movies display today. Movies that do progressive politics wrong (i.e. star wars 8) could really learn a thing or two from this. It was really cool and even put a heavy emphasis on female empowerment through the heavily female body guards which were super cool to watch in the action scenes!It works so well because you don't feel like you're forcefed some overly diverse/female cast. You just legitimately like the characters and they work great together, which is pretty much the most you could ask for.","Black Panther",2506,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2509",4.5,"  OK I went and saw BP last night and all I can say is WOW! What a great movie. Not sure what the people are bitching about being political. I'm white, 56, conservative, voted for Donald Trump, and absolutely loved this movie. I mean if you want to say that some of this might be political, well so did many who went and saw Avatar but I was not one of those. It was just a great movie. LIke this guy: ThorZeroFeb 17, 2018Mediocre, don't bother with this movie. Decent special effects, boring with poor humor. Jump of the hype train. Never ride it.All I can say of this review is bullshit! This guy must of been going to the counter eating popcorn or something cause is stupid. T'Challa is full of love and not hate. This movie is love and not hate. T'Challa and Peter Parker was great in Captain America and were both my favorite in CA and it transferred over into this movie. Both Spider-Man and Black Panther are great movies.","Black Panther",2509,4.1,-0.4
"2510",3.5,"  Great movie, not perfect. It didn't sit well with me that a civilisation so far advanced would be so insular and not do far more (even covertly) than they do for the incredibly poor nations around them. It didn't sit well that such a nation decides leaders through ritual combat to the death. It didn't sit well that such a nation thinks armored rhinos and spears are valid weapons (rhinos looked terribly fake too).But the characters were wonderful (loved Shuri) and the story suitably epic and the South Korea sequence great (although just because you disdain guns shouldn't mean bullets just ignore you).Liked the villains, my god villains that aren't soulless CGI monstrosities, DC could learn a thing or two there.","Black Panther",2510,4.1,0.6
"2511",5,"  Brilliant! CGI fight scene at the end were a bit sketchy, but strong cast and acting make it throughly enjoyable.","Black Panther",2511,4.1,-0.9
"2512",4,"  Solid MCU offering that does far more than entertain. No weak links in the cast: Letitia Wright is a wonderful highlight as Shuri, Chadwick Boseman continues to be awesome. I really enjoyed this film. It's a good MCU story and mixes humour and tact over its role in groundbreaking for racial equality. Objectively, it's still a comic-book movie and won't help anyone with superhero fatigue but it's a great example of the genre and, finally, why diverse casting and story-telling has been long overdue in Hollywood. It only raises the bar in anticipation of the Infinity Wars. More like this please.","Black Panther",2512,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2516",3,"  Uneven. Mismatched CGI against African exteriors. Nelson Mandela channelled beside the real Black Panthers. Another Marvel film where interest and emotion is sparked by the villains rather than the heroes.","Black Panther",2516,4.1,1.1
"2517",5,"  An excellent film. Powerful exposition, character development, and an actual tying into African culture(s). It's important that it takes place in an African nation where the people were never touched by slavery or colonialism. The Eric Killmonger character, his pain and internal conflict, is better than I could've imagined and will be discussed for years.","Black Panther",2517,4.1,-0.9
"2518",3,"  Strong black and female characters dominate; its impressive tackling of political isolationism also makes it the right film at the right time. Unrealistic video-game violence significantly undermines impact, however. It's just too predictable now.","Black Panther",2518,4.1,1.1
"2519",5,"  I've seen Black Panther twice now and I loved it even more the second time around! The world building, the character development, the themes and the villian...loved it all! Wakanda forever!","Black Panther",2519,4.1,-0.9

"2521",5,"  I loved it. I hope they have another one.","Black Panther",2521,4.1,-0.9
"2522",5,"  The movie goes beyond special effects and action. The main characters are well developed and complex as well as the story line that is filled with historical and social references. I love that the films puts African themes in a futuristic setting (one wonders what Africa could have been like if it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its resources and labor). And I also love that it brings the racists out on social media who will look for reasons to denigrate or hate this movie??.","Black Panther",2522,4.1,-0.9
"2523",2.5,"  I found the movie a bit boring to be honest. I always like the black panther character but the movie was underwhelming. especially after reading the hype by some people.","Black Panther",2523,4.1,1.6
"2524",2.5,"  As a movie critic, my chief responsibility is to tell you whether a given release is worth your time and money. While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie.","Black Panther",2524,4.1,1.6
"2525",5,"  This film has been a long time coming. Where Wonder Woman celebrates the strongest, most heroic, and fearless that women can be as superheroes while starring them, where Coco (and Book of Life) sincerely celebrates Mexican culture, Black Panther rises on a pedestal that embraces an amazing ensemble of actors and actresses doing justice by the characters they portray while glorifying the various elements and cultures of Africa through Wakanda. This is one of the better, if not best, Marvel film to come out yet, beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi, mystical fantasy, spy, drama, and action elements, standing out as more than a superhero story. While it focuses on Chadwick Boseman as an African King and his nation at a peak unlike anything imaginable, this film is also unafraid to call back to the real-life cruel histories of slavery, colonization, and centuries of racial oppression and discrimination through Killmonger, amazingly portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, who has now joined the tiers of great and compelling super villains like Ian McKellen's Magneto, Tom Hiddleston's Loki, and Heath Ledger's Joker. While a film like this has been a long time coming since Blade, I am actually glad it took this long to make a Black Panther movie because no other director, no other writers, no other team, no other studio in any previous time would have given Black Panther the dedication, the music, the characters, and story that would have done this superhero and Wakanda justice. Black Panther is not only possibly the best Marvel movie, it is also one of the best superhero movies period. Also, watch it in IMAX. It makes a real difference.","Black Panther",2525,4.1,-0.9

"2529",3.5,"  I saw the movie yesterday and I have to say it was a great movie, but it was way to predictable. We've seen Black Panther in Civil War and in my opinion he was more awesome in Civil War than in his own movie. The movie also created to many questions. There were a lot scenes where I thought: wait how and why did this happened. Everybody was so hyped about it and especially about Killmonger, but I liked Ulysses Klaue more. In my opinion the movie could have been better. I give the movie a 76%","Black Panther",2529,4.1,0.6
"2530",1,"  Terrible. Could have been a 4/4.5 star movie! Instead they had to throw in Social Justice multiple times during the movie, and turned the Farthest Right Wing hero into a raging leftists. Ruined the character and its pretty clear disney is going to ruin the Franchise.","Black Panther",2530,4.1,3.1
"2531",0.5,"  A fantasy what if movie. Attractive characters running around with no real focus or story. The whole thing comes off as a social justice psa with a watered down marvel twist. The movie does not leave any room or opening for any other super heros from the marvel franchise. This leads me to believe this will be another Edward Norton (Hulk) or Tobey Maguire (Spiderman) movie that will be remade and re-released to tweak the story to fit the franchise and hopefully get some substance. Basically a small portion of Africa has the same protective bubble that the Amazon s have in wonder woman...(real original). Inside the bubble are 5 tribes that basically fight for the right to rule the bubble. They have advanced technology and super smarts the perfect facade of Utopia. But all the advanced tools and tech is not enough to get them out of the tribal mindset so they have to fight and challenge to find the one man worthy to be King and thus the black panther. Surprised feminist haven't started rioting on that account. But to their credit they royal soldier force are made of woman. So long story short real history happens outside the bubble and the 5 tribes do nothing to circumvent things like slavery. Then in 92 a prince gets killed in America leaving an orphaned boy to be raised by the system. Turns out the boy does really well for himself is promoted through the us military and decides he wants the bubble for himself and then the world because he feels all black people are still slaves. He confronts the king of the bubble whose response is that black people in other countries are not citizens of the bubble just because of their skin color and thus not a priority. So the boy gets mad steals the throne for a few days with plans to liberate every black person around the world and end the colonization control. Anyone not black is seen as a colonizer and thus is oppressive to anyone black. As a stand alone movie I think it works, but if it's held up to the franchise, it is severely lacking.","Black Panther",2531,4.1,3.6

"2533",5,"  To all the people who are offended by this movie or think it's racist, it's completely not. It was one hell of a plot twist and shared an story adaptation. If you find this movie somewhat offensive either you are to dang sensitive or just looking to be offended.","Black Panther",2533,4.1,-0.9
"2534",3,"  I THOUGHT IT WAS SLOW BUT MY TEENAGE SON LOVED SO IT WORTH IT BUT LIKED SPIDERMAN AND OTHERS BETTER","Black Panther",2534,4.1,1.1
"2535",4,"  Black Panther amazes with stunning visuals, interesting characters, and an overall great experience. After 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally introduces a villain that has meaningful motivations yet is as evil as they come. Micheal B. Jordan delivers a remarkable performance and brings the role of Erik Killmonger to life. His performance as the main villain is by far the best part about the movie. The signature Marvel humor did pop up from time to time, but there was rarely an over-abundance of humor, it was well controlled and distributed throughout the movie, giving the movie a real dramatic feel. As great as the movie is, it is not one without flaws. For instance, the action sequences were great but were hard to keep up with due to the large amount of people fighting on screen at once. The action was reportedly inspired by 2015's Creed, which focuses on one on one combat, so it seems Ryan tried to bring that sort of action to the Black Panther film but frankly did not fit well with the film's large cast and battle sequences. Black Panther is the latest (as of Feb 2018) of films directed by Ryan Coogler and certainly does not disappoint.","Black Panther",2535,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2536",4.5,"  For a superhero movie, this was surprisingly deep and well-written. Very entertaining from start to finish, and an amazing script that criss-crosses real-world issues with fantasy, creating one of the best villains with the perfect shade of grey in Killmonger","Black Panther",2536,4.1,-0.4
"2537",4.5,"  With Creed director Ryan Coogler at the helm and some jaw-dropping cinematography from Mudbound's Rachel Morrison, Black Panther is a cut above the rest, a unique and original vision that could mark the dawn of a new era in studio filmmaking. It's also one of the MCU's best entries yet.","Black Panther",2537,4.1,-0.4
"2538",5,"  Great movie. It was extremely well done and the story was very interesting as well. Great visual effects and lots of action with just enough humor that did not compromise the seriousness of the story.","Black Panther",2538,4.1,-0.9
"2539",3.5,"  Really enjoyable superhero movie. Plot is pretty good, but not perfect. Some character motivations seem sketchy and forced, like the way one of the Wakanda tribes abandons all sense to support an outsider's challenge for the throne. And it's hard to rationalize the existence of super-advanced technology/medicine with a culture that accepts one-on-one mortal combat as a legitimate way to challenge and depose a new king. The acting is solid and the action is fun. Not sure how this expanded Marvel universe works, with so many powerful alternative worlds in co-existence (our world, Spiderman's, the X-Men's, Asgard, Wakanda, Dr. Strange's world, etc.). I favor the separate characters and separate imaginary worlds; I wish there wasn't always the push for supergroups when members come from alternative universes.","Black Panther",2539,4.1,0.6
"2540",0.5,"  Walked out at the hour mark. Bored out of my mind of this Iron Man mixed with ""James Bond"" thrown in (his sister is ""Q""). A challenge fight at last second that we all know main character will win, drug enhanced dreams of showing dead father speaking to him, and somehow missed an important artifact was stolen to eventually lead to showdown with the villain. I am completely dumfounded by the RT scores for this.","Black Panther",2540,4.1,3.6
"2541",3.5,"  Trigger Warning: A Caucasian individual is going to review Black Panther.Awe, yisss! The movie that one should take care in today's politicized climate...But y'know what? Let's set a racialized dialog aside and tackle this movie head on: it has its fun set-pieces in a rather scripted and derivative story arc. I wouldn't call it ""fresh"" or ""groundbreaking,"" but this movie is not without its charm. Chadwick Boseman steals the show with a persona mixed with calm aggression and warmth befitting a hero. In my eyes though, Winston Duke hit it out of the park with M'Baku. His delivery and take on this character evoked laughter from me, entertaining me to such a degree that I want to see a spin-off for his character. Danai Gurira's and Lupita Nyong'o's roles did not resonate as strongly as Boseman's and as such, their respective roles (Okoye and Nakia, respectively) failed to develop into fully formed characters worthy of attention. If anything, these characters existed to elevate Boseman's role even higher. Jordan's Killmonger was a flop for me - a slang-riddled opportunity that was wasted given Jordan's ability to perform well onscreen. I found his character to be a gauche clash with the immersive surroundings and as such, seeing him onscreen really took me out of the immersion. This is a sad reality given the amount of attention and care was put forth into building Wakanda as a living and breathing city. Andy Serkis though - man, can this guy mold into roles.Were there be threads of social commentary mixed in the screenplay? Sadly, yes and I did find myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. Is it obnoxious though? Not really and I did not find it to detract from the overall narrative. Does it live up to the hype? Honestly? I would say that it's better to see it on a cheap night: it did not resonate as strongly with me as previous Marvel outings and as such, I would not call this movie to be ""the best Marvel movie evar."" It is a solid 3.5/5. But seriously, Winston Duke....Man, I am impressed. ""Oooooh, Oooooh, Ooooooh"" - M'Baku.3.5 Colonizers out of 5.","Black Panther",2541,4.1,0.6

Michele B Jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the actors do fine.

"2553",2.5,"  I thought the costumes were great, but the pacing was super slow. I guess thats to be expected from an origins movie, but there are only like 4 action scenes in the whole movie and they are the type of action scene where there is a cut to a different close in camera angle before every punch. Seriously, you have over a 100 million dollar budget, the least you could do is hire a stunt coordinator for your ""action movie."" But dont get me wrong, I liked most of the characters, especially Killmonger who was pretty much the only character that wasn't one-dimensional.

"2561",5,"  Chadwick Boseman returns to don the power and suit of the Black Panther. This time in his own movie! After his father died, T'Challa finds himself in a novelty path of becoming what it is to be a true king of Wakanda but while being thwarted by something that was created a long time ago, an adversary by blood. The dark past catches up in T'Challa's life and not just him, but everyone around him are in danger. With the help of the people he trusts and love, the kingdom must be saved.Despite of what everyone is claiming it to be and don't get me wrong, this is by far the best Marvel comic book movie adaptation ever. Thor Ragnarok was just the tip of the iceberg, bridging and weaving in the story to our ultimate goal: Infinity War. Black Panther is what I hoped for and while I expect nothing less of the movie, the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow. Michael B. Jordan as the super villain known as Killmonger did a superb job and I must say, he totally redeem himself from that other Marvel movie he was in. So I deem him one of our greatest super villains in the MCU. Lupita Nyong'O as Nakia, Danai Gurira as Okoya, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, and last but not least Letitia Wright as Shuri, all did so frickin' awesome with their performances! I can see why everyone loves Shuri and it's understandable but man oh man, Chadwick Boseman outdone himself again as the Black Panther. His first appearance in Captain America: Civil War was truly great and seeing him in his own solo movie as Black Panther is without a doubt another superb performance. Can't wait to see him to continue the role in Infinity War. Hopefully we can get another sequel? Maybe even two more? Black Panther is actually one of my favorite characters in the Marvel comic book universe, so would love to see more of him. Let's not forget Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. He did more than we thought he could do in the film and he kicked ass. Glad to see he has enough spotlight as everyone else did. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue was such titular villain that seeing his performance with the character was a great treat.Black Panther is a comic book movie from Marvel Studios that you can not miss. If you're on a journey like the rest of us who watched since the very first build up from the very beginning, then you know that it's just the beginning for these beloved Marvel characters. With Infinity War coming real soon, our hype is just growing by the day.","Black Panther",2561,4.1,-0.9

We all want to to see movies with big ideas, about diverse stories and cultures, and the journey that makes one greater.Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan are amazing as defining others- T'Challa (Black Panther) and Erik Stevens. Heroes like Chadwick have power in their tears, their compassion.

"2573",4,"  One of the best of the MCU, the action is great, the humor is enjoyable yet not insufferable like some other Marvel productions, the script may be a little predictible but the performance and the overall message of the movie makes up for it.","Black Panther",2573,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2574",1,"  This movie has great reviews because the cast is black, the director is black and the writers are black. Everyone is afraid to say it's only a mediocre Marvel film because of that. It's no better than any of the Spiderman or Fantastic 4 films - in fact some of the CGI and most of the script is very subpar. On top of being exuberantly antiwhite and grotesquely metapolitical (huge distraction from mostly 'meh' film), the movie is just a middle of the road action flick and just another Marvel event. I found myself intensely disliking this movie.","Black Panther",2574,4.1,3.1
"2575",2.5,"  Highly overrated, presumably due to the political implications surrounding the film. If you review this solely as a film it simply misses the mark on what could have been something great.The world building would have been more believable if they had bothered to build real complete sets and avoided such an over reliance on CGI. Sadly by the third act it becomes a mess of CGI and we do not even get a decent end battle between the Boseman and Jordan. Is it really to much to ask for some real fight choreography and stuntwork?Performances are great however from the cast , Boseman does well but feels like he's not given enough time to shine in his own film.Jordan is fine but far from the fantastic villain other reviewers have proclaimed killmonger to be.Serkis is great as always and chews up the scenary.Freeman is pretty much pointless and should have been left out of the film.","Black Panther",2575,4.1,1.6
"2576",4.5,"  This movie was so much fun. Loved it. after the first 30 minutes it really kicked into high gear and i was fixed. great story. great origin. great world created and systems created. great villain with a great back story and motive. what a fascinating character kill monger was. i loved the story of someone who was radicalized. so well done. Michael B Jordan was phenomenal as kill monger. and Andy Serkis as Klau. Charisma just oozing off the screen. he need more real life roles. why was chadwick boseman whispering or yelling the whole movie. kind of annoying. the accents were all over the place. a little distracting.i never freeze - lame character development attempt that never played out. the green screen when Tchalla sees his ancestors when gets is covered in snow while in the coma. the echo sound effect really shows you the green screen. which maybe is acceptable because it is heaven or something. but it read as green screen.why did the guy from 'get out' surrender to the female warrior? story didnt readi never got any closure with the wakandans? mom returning? t'challa dealing with the guy from get out?how did he survive that fall? not buying it.what move did tchalla do to win the battle at the end? that michael b jordan said nice move and the fighting wskindo f hidden and literally dont know what the climatic action moment of the movie was. does the US not care that those wakandan planes were flying all over oakland?","Black Panther",2576,4.1,-0.4

"2581",5,"  The five stars is due to the fact that I expected the MCU formula and was pleasantly surprised instead.Loved it. Great characters all around. Especially refreshing to see a complex, three-dimensional villain for the first time in an MCU movie.I loved the fact that it wasn't preachy at all. The female and black characters felt like real and likeable people and not like artificial tools to send a PC message.Thematically it is also the best MCU film by far.","Black Panther",2581,4.1,-0.9
"2582",3,"  With all of the hype I was really expecting a better superhero movie. I get the attention, it is a cool story with originality and it has a very timely subject matter... but the execution, the action, the CGI and the story telling was WAY under par for the critical acclaim. You can obsess over it for political reasons or whatever, as a superhero movie I think there are many better ones out there. (IronMan 1, Avengers, Dark Night, Capt America Civil War)","Black Panther",2582,4.1,1.1
"2583",5,"  This movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite MCU movie along side the winter soldier, but as a stand-alone movie this is where this movie goes above and beyond.

"2585",3.5,"  Quality film, I think it's good but it could have been a touch better with minor tweaks. Some will call it the best Marvel movie ever and for some people they may see it that way. It's got cultural significance, there's a lot to like. I loved the supporting cast more than the main characters. I saw it in 3D AVX and I don't know that 3D added much to it. I'll give people who are going to see it this advice, it's pacing is somewhat uneven, even slow and most of the film is dialogue driven. Don't expect it to blow you away but be confident you'll enjoy the experience.","Black Panther",2585,4.1,0.6
"2586",2,"  i saw the movie. it's a weird movie, it wasn't bad, but not as good as any of the previous marvel movies. the black folks lived in a country with very unstable government (all you need to do to be leader with real political power is defeat the existing leader in combat), they are totally reliant on one form of resource, and for some reason they believe they are oppressed (spolier alert)-at the end of the movie, a Wankandian said something along the lines of-i'd die than living in bondage, like my ancestors-Wakanda was never conquered by European settlers, all wakandians lived in secrecy, how could his ancestors have been slaves??the action scenes weren't as good for Marvel standards","Black Panther",2586,4.1,2.1

"2589",2.5,"  It's ok, but far from the best MCU film as some say. In fact it still follows the same tired Marvel formula. It actually took a lot of plot points from Thor Ragnarok which is why I can't give it more than a 4. Marvel needs to start giving us more expansive and diverse stories, and not just the same stories told in a slightly different way. This film did the same thing Doctor Strange did with Iron man.","Black Panther",2589,4.1,1.6
"2590",5,"  What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!","Black Panther",2590,4.1,-0.9
"2591",4,"  Breaking box office records, does Black Panther live up to the hype? Sort of. It is certainly a good film that will result in a fine time at the cinema, but to say it's better than other MCU movies would be a stretch. After an appearance in the recent Captain America movie, Civil War, Chadwick Boseman returns to the big screen donning the Black Panther outfit. This time he is ascending to the throne of Wakanda, the third world African nation that isn't all it seems from the outside. Boseman does an adequate job creating the legend called the Black Panther, also known as T'Challa; he is both a force to be reckoned with and a balanced character with quiet intellect and noble ambition. However, T'Challa lacks the charisma of a Captain America or Tony Stark and his character over the course of the film is rather static. This makes him more of a plain superhero in a dope suit. This also leads to many scenes being stolen from him; you likely will remember scenes from the movie because of something someone else said or did. The women surrounding T'Challa, in particular, deserve credit for distinguishing themselves as independent, unique characters that serve as more than the typical female love interest. Danai Gurira (Walking Dead fans will know her as Michonne) plays Okoye, a strong leader of an all-female security/military regiment; her intensity in the role may come off as overly serious, but I think it makes her character more intimidating. Letitia Wright plays Shuri, the younger sister of T'Challa who plays a Lucius Fox-esque role, always looking to improve and create the tech that makes Black Panther so strong. Her playfulness with T'Challa and lively spirit help to lighten the mood. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia, who is an untraditional love interest who plays hard to get with T'Challa. The standout of the film, however, is Michael B. Jordan, who plays the menacing antagonist Killmonger with a hunger for vengeance. Jordan is magnetic in the role and one of the more compelling, complicated villains I have seen in this type of movie. What makes Killmonger a special antagonist is that his anger is both understandable and reasonable. His grand statements are based on sensible arguments and his goals go beyond simply taking over the world. I only wish his role in the movie was more prominent. Other performances of note include Andy Serkis, who is fun to watch as baddie Ulysses Klaue; Martin Freeman, who pretty much ends up playing Martin Freeman, and Daniel Kaluuya, the Get Out star, who goes underused in the movie and doesn't add much to the story. Beyond the performances, there are plenty of things to like in Black Panther. The score is solid, driven by the sound beat of a drum and African chorals. I am a fan not only of the Black Panther suit but think the costumes (and makeup) all around were very well done and served as vibrant shows of African culture. However, the movie relies heavily on CGI which I thought at times was too noticeable. My bigger problem, however, was the large-scale battle towards the end of the film which becomes a hectic CG fest. There is a lot going on, but the excess of visuals does little to enhance the film other than to amplify the action. It becomes the same saturated mess that quite frankly, I am tired of watching. The more intimate fights for the throne that take place on a waterfall(?), are much more interesting; each punch and stab is felt by the audience and in turn, you become more engaged in what is happening. Although infrequent, these fights are the best moments in the movie. Unfortunately, one of those fights is not the final showdown between T'Challa and Killmonger. Black Panther is a solid film that, without a doubt, will entertain. Nonetheless, the film has imperfections. It is a bit predictable, the main protagonist isn't particularly interesting, and the ending turns into a conventional, superhero frenzy without the personal connection great superhero movies like Logan have. I certainly recommend seeing Black Panther, but calling it a tad overrated is not out of the question.","Black Panther",2591,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2598",3.5,"  One of the best of the Marvel superhero movies I've seen. I wasn't familiar with the Black Panther going in so the storyline development was useful. There are several characters that are well developed, including the primary villain. And a lot of the characters were strong women, which is good to see.

"2604",5,"  Black Panther has transcended the cookie cutter Marvel franchise. In seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of African culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world. Set designs, costumes, music. In that context it places complex characters, and lets the audience experience with them the unfolding of unexpected information about people close to them. Lets the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations. Villains with complexity. Heroes with complexity. Layered story lines. So many characters doing the unexpected. This movie raises the bar for anyone attempting to adapt a comic book to the screen.","Black Panther",2604,4.1,-0.9
"2605",3.5,"  very solid movie but definitely over hyped. Michael B is quite a unique character and a villain that hasn't really be presented in theatres yet in the Marcel universe.

"2606",2,"  BLACK PANTHERwas good but not the be all its being made out to be.There was very little action and the messaging was very heavy handed and it also felt like the people who made this relied on a lot of African stereo types i.e the plate lip thing that was a practice that was started to put off the white slavers they didn't want unattractive slaves and in this wakanda has been isolated for millennia so why would this have been part of there culture because it sure made talking an issue lol the film was over long and they didn't film any of it in Africa wtf","Black Panther",2606,4.1,2.1

Everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time making it. Some plot holes and inconsistencies, but if you ignore the fact that Wakanda is LITERALLY ""Atlantis"" and not just a secret nation, but a totally alien one, then you will have a great time watching it. Interested to see how the tech in Wakanda changes the world in the MArvel universe, will it affect MAOS and the Netflix stories, because the tech is even more impossible than what Tony Stark has! All in all a truly enjoyable movie to watch.","Black Panther",2622,4.1,-0.4

"2627",2.5,"  Even if you ignore all the social media hoopla, 'Panther' could have been so much better. Marvel seems to have topped out creatively with ships and buildings that are unique to Wakanda are not so unique to the MCU. There are plot issues and leaps in logic (other than willing suspension of disbelief). Hopefully, his second outing will flow and entertain better than the first. Not a bad movie, just not good enough to watch again.","Black Panther",2627,4.1,1.6
"2628",4,"  What makes Marvel's ""Black Panther"" such a breath of fresh air is the creative visual style and character focused storytelling. I really liked all of the characters in this movie and the motivations were clear. Coogler truly has made a movie that really can't be compared to any other movie currently in the MCU. I feel this movie showcased one of the best villains Marvel is had recently with Michael B. Jordan. I understood his frustrations and motivations and thought he was very compelling. The downside is that he really isn't in the movie for very long. I thought this was a missed opportunity since his character was so interesting to me. This is a very character-focused movie, which in the end makes it impressive, but it also hinders some of the pacing in the first half and a few segments dragged for me. This is still a first-rate Marvel movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. The story is unique and visually stunning and the actions scenes are all excellent. There is one chase scene, in particular, that is very well done and the finale is also breathtaking. All in all the movie is a joyous celebration of African culture and a captivating, character-driven story that will please Marvel fans who are looking for something different.","Black Panther",2628,4.1,0.0999999999999996

The story is all about T'Challa, and his struggle to be a noble king. Along comes Killmonger, played nicely by Jordan who wants the throne for himself. The cast is great, with Boseman doing a good job. The visuals are solid, though some of the effects could use some work. The pacing is fine, and the second act is the best. The third act loses some momentum but overall it ends on a deeply personal note that makes up for it. Black Panther is a great entry into the MCU and is my fifth favorite one behind Civil War, Guardians, Spider-Man Homecoming, and Age of Ultron. Now please give me Infinity War.","Black Panther",2641,4.1,-0.4

"2647",4,"  Black Panther (Movie Review)..""this is a spoiler-free review, don't worry! you're safe with me.""...I have to say, this has been a wonderful 10 years for the Marvel Cinematic Universe...This film was great, it's not that perfect but it's amazing. Thomas and I were really hoping that the storyline for Black Panther would be very intreresting, and it hit our expectations just right....I'm not going to describe the film's flaws, I'm just here to explain what I felt when we watched the film..The one thing that I really liked about this movie was the ""pacing"", because it built up certain characters, and the plot was given piece by piece to the audience like it is an important thing for the next ""Avengers"" film, and when the climax was happening you would actually care for the characters...Especially for the main villain here, I have to be honest with you, the main antagonist was an absolute necessary in the storyline. Because he has a reason why he's doing all of these bad things, even though he's on the wrong side, you could actually see him as a human being...And that is what I call ""Good Writing"", the writers in this film really focused on the ""characters"", because they wanted you to root for ""Black Panther"" when ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is already happening....I think all of them did a pretty good job in making the ""MCU"" films. I don't know...I mean, I don't know how they do it...Because NONE of the MCU films were awful, every single one of them was either ""great"" or ""okay""......I can't say anything else, please, go see this film if you have free time...It's worth it!.I'm going to give ""Black Panther"" a solid ""9 out of 10""","Black Panther",2647,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2648",3,"  INTRODUCTION:This was a pretty good show. Not as good as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1, or Ant Man, but pretty good. And it's definitely way better than The Last Jedi, but that's not saying much.THE GOOD:* Very cool presentation of Wakanda* Interesting to see how the Black Panther transitions to new people* Great to see an advanced African culture* The characters and acting were greatTHE BAD:* The main villain wasn't really somebody I hated; he was too sympathetic* Not super funny, like some of the other Marvel shows, and that's probably okay; not every movie needs to be stand-up comedy (*cough* *cough* - The Last Jedi); so maybe disregard this comment* Don't really have a desire to watch it again; it was good, but not that good; but I wouldn't avoid it; it's a good movie, but for me, it's just not blow-my-socks-off awesomeCONCLUSION:Overall, I enjoyed the show, but not sure I'd put it on as high a pedestal as some have. For me, I think the movie was definitely a good, high quality show, but without a strong urge to re-watch. For me, it kind of ranks there with Captain America: The First Avenger.","Black Panther",2648,4.1,1.1
"2649",4,"  This movie is good by far but it is not as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says. This movie is fun and all but it is not as good as other marvel movies such as civil war. The villain is okay and predicable but did have potential. T'challa did not grow very much in the movie but gave some good action. I did like this movie not to bash it but it was not as good as most of the others. Max I could give it is 4 stars.","Black Panther",2649,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2650",5,"  I saw this movie and it was amazing. The special effects were next level. I also really enjoyed the fact that the cast was mostly black. It was also interesting to see traditional African cultures meet the high tech advanced Wakanda in an action packed adventure.","Black Panther",2650,4.1,-0.9
"2651",5,"  A great superhero film carried by its directing and cast. This is one of the best looking movies, marvel has ever done.. The action, through scarce, is very well done and very riveting. Overall this well directed movie is one of the best marvel has to offer","Black Panther",2651,4.1,-0.9
"2652",5,"  OMG!!!! Amazing. The action, emotion, scenery, make up and costumes, character development.... My top Marvel movie right now!","Black Panther",2652,4.1,-0.9
"2653",1,"  Totally Overrated - No Plot, bad CGI, bad Movie.","Black Panther",2653,4.1,3.1
"2654",2.5,"  Well, the movie is not bad, but being a Marvel flick it comes across a bit weak. Especially compared to the last one, Thor Ragnarok, it's incredibly weak. Sure, there are cool fighting scenes with spears (it's Africa, right?!) and even an OK battle, but as a whole it does not convince. Besides that, the visual quality when there are scene swipes from one side to the other is surprisingly poor, even perturbing your eyes (even more so in 3D or so). All in all, it's watchable, but nothing to brag about. 5/10 points.","Black Panther",2654,4.1,1.6
"2655",3.5,"  The screenplay adaptation of Stan Lee's comic novel seems very accurate. As an introductory movie, Black Panther gives the character a strong backdrop of his history and origins. The actors all pull off amazing performances, enhanced by a strong use of CGI. The movie puts across the significance of many cultural and humanitarian principles, as most Stan Lee's superhero's strive to do, yet social topics throughout the movie could be referenced with more empathy. The script writing for dialogue seems poor, and the implicit nature of feminist and cultural (west vs africa, white vs black, ). The amount of emphasis of Wakanda's superior technology, fuelled by vibranium, wares thin and cringey as the film progresses (not to mention how the Wakandan's are actually a rather hostile people, formed of many tribes, all reluctant to share either the knowledge or material resources.) Although the action scenes are well worth giving this movie watch. Overall a good watch, but one to take with a pinch of salt when listening to any means of this trying to bridge social-cultural gaps.","Black Panther",2655,4.1,0.6
"2656",3,"  see, its called democracy..Black PantherAn alluring and beguile world, fancy technology, mythically inherent rituals and a knack for projecting breathtaking action sequences are the high points of this feature that is not only supported but celebrated by the IMAX screen. Black Panther is raw non-volatile feature that begrudges and empowers the humanness in it despite of its ""superness"" but is confined within a territory that is loosely placed on over 134 minutes of runtime stretching its way to create something colossal out of just a mere idea. Ryan Coogler puts all his chips in to create this huge act and is convincing throughout the course of it but is somewhat restrained by the script that is familiar to the viewers. Chadwick Boseman tries a lot to overpower the other actors opposite him but there is something that just doesn't feel like ""king"" to us yet, whilst on the other hand he is supported by some of the finest talents like Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o and other cameos that holds tightly onto their parts. Black Panther takes its time to settle in; especially its first act, and reaches for the bigger bite on its second act which is quite interesting as the plot thickens and politics gets in but all of that is barely around us before the last act arrives which is not only predictable but also seems a bit long.","Black Panther",2656,4.1,1.1
"2657",4.5,"  It was a great story with an incredibly nuanced villain that demonstrated the historic dynamic between Africans and African Americans. The costumes were amazing and the action was incredible. If you can, go see it in 3D or 4D.","Black Panther",2657,4.1,-0.4
"2658",0.5,"  i rate this movie 1/10 cus it bad. And has bad story telling, bad action scene and in all is a marvel movie so bad.","Black Panther",2658,4.1,3.6
"2659",3,"  I read on social media, that angry DC fans are trying to sabotage this film here on Rotten Tomatoes. I can assure you that I am not a angry DC fan and I am writing this review only after having seen the film. As I said, I am not a DC fan and I am not a Marvel fan either. I am just your average movie goers, who goes to watch films in expectation of entertainment and perhaps a couple of life-lessons to take away home.I didn't expect life-lessons from Black Panther, only entertainment, which I feel it failed to deliver. You don't need angry DC fans for this film to write bad reviews, this film is capable of doing that on it's own!I can't tell you much about the story because I couldn't understand half of what they were speaking because I wasn't able to get through their thick accents. The movie theatre didn't even have the decency to provide subtitles.Black Panther feels like two different films in its two different halves. The things that happen in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half. The action sequences were amazing and the I loved the long continuous take of fighting sequences, but as I said none of that mattered in the long run.The second half is where I started to gain interest, but it wasn't enough. Erik Killmonger was a decent villain played decently by Michael B. Jordan. The plot devices so save our heroes were pretty obvious. The last fight sequence fell flat for me.Brand me a racist if you want, I can't say that I liked Black Panther. Maybe it was the hype that was generated around this film or it was just a bad film I don't know. I regret spending my money and wasting my time on it.","Black Panther",2659,4.1,1.1
"2660",4.5,"  This movie does a great job of expanding the Marvel brand into uncharted territories, and connecting with an audience on numerous levels. I found myself wanting to dig deeper into character motivations, primarily those of T'Challa and N'Jadaka (Killmonger). Ultimately, this kept me locked in to the evolution of the plot. I'd go 87/100. NIce!","Black Panther",2660,4.1,-0.4
"2661",1.5,"  The worst marvel movie besides civil war, the plot was boring and was overwhelmed by the effort to give it a social complaining, the angles of the camera were lazy and tchalla was a boxing bag","Black Panther",2661,4.1,2.6
"2662",3,"  It's neither a dumb supehero movie, nor a strong, politically heavy film. Apart from some really good work with the characters like Ulysses Klaue, which was my favorite, Black Panther is a standard sci-fi/action/adventure with predictable storytelling and average cg and action.","Black Panther",2662,4.1,1.1
"2663",5,"  Anyone who knows me knows I'm one of the harshest MCU critics. So don't take this lightly & believe me when I say this, ""Black Panther"" is a true masterpiece.The costume design department did a terrific job of encompassing clothing styles from different African cultures & blending them with some slick modern touches thus creating some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the MCU has ever sewn.A film such as this one is unavoidably CGI-heavy. So a special care must be taken into smoothing everything & mixing it all together. This film, albeit the final battle which looked a bit cartoonish, did so meticulously. The way Wakanda's technological advancements are presented is a sight to be seen & the attention to even the smallest detail is something I always highly appreciate.The score or soundtrack, in my opinion, is one of the most critical aspects of a film. It can single-handedly destroy, pass through unnoticed or elevate a film. I must admit, going in & by the very few promotional materials I had watched beforehand, I had a completely different idea of how the film's score was going to sound. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Both Ludwig Göransson & Kendrick Lamar did an exceptional job & created an organic & befitting score.The amount of acting talent brought together for ""Black Panther"" felt uncommonly high for an MCU film, so much so that I almost felt starstrucked. Major acting names such as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya & many more, made their MCU debut & I have to say, they did an absolutely terrific job.Lupita Nyong'o was really good & thankfully her character wasn't reduced to the typical ""love interest"" but instead is shown as a badass warrior & a philanthropist who will always speak her mind no matter what. Of course, the trophy for the most absolute badass character of them all must go to none other than ""Okoye"" (Danai Gurira), the forever-loyal Wakandan general of the ""Dora Milaje"". Let's just say you should never get on her cross-hairs if you know what's good for you. My new favourite MCU supporting character is ""Shuri"" who is brought to life by Letitia Wright. Let us hope she gets a good chunk of screen-time during ""Infinity War"" in order to develop her character because I desperately want to see much more of her. Andy Serkis exudes a level of craziness, almost on a psychopathic level, that has left me in awe of his acting chops, even without the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores.Last but certainly not least, a couple of big names surrounding the film, the protagonist Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) & the antagonist Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Chadwick portrays a Prince trying to step into the shoes of a King & realizing it's a task that hides many dangers & secrets. What more can be said about Chadwick after such a performance other than he has now become the embodiment of Black Panther & it'll be difficult watching him in other roles in the future. A special mention must specifically be made to Michael B. Jordan who has now officially joined the list of actors who have redeemed themselves for previous comic-book movie roles. After 10 years, Michael brings to life the MCU's 1st formidable villain who is completely serious, doesn't joke around, means business & at the same time is a villain the audience can actually relate to. Throughout the film, viewers develop a level of sympathy towards him despite his violent tendencies & can understand where he is coming from, even somewhat justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure. Michael B. Jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film & delivers one of the most (if not the most) powerful & memorable lines in the entirety of the MCU. A phrase that manages to stick with you even several days after viewing the film. Since my reviews tend to be spoiler-free, I'll not be adding it here. Those who have watched the film surely know which one I'm referring to. As for the rest of you, what the hell are you even still doing here? Go watch the film.""Black Panther"" is a contemporary comic-book movie gem, a proof that the age of comic-book movies is not yet over. A further testament that comic-book movies can still produce original, fresh ideas that shelter deep, thought-provoking messages of female empowerment as well as racial & people of color recognition, appreciation & representation while at the same time challenging some misguided sociopolitical norms that are bleeding our planet & its inhabitants.(Updated from 15/02/2018)","Black Panther",2663,4.1,-0.9
"2664",2.5,"  Black Panther is a deathly serious superhero movie that attempts light-hearted comedic moments and fails entirely. As far a marvel films go it is incredibly average in terms of action. Compared to other recent marvel movies, the social references we're out of control, especially with a what are those reference, and it falls flat comedically and breaks the serious tone the movie sets about delicate social issues. The movie tries very hard to add real world social issues into a fictional universe, somewhat succeeds but ultimately falls a little flat in terms of actual solutions to those problems (the social issues can play into the fictional world but the solutions can't come from the fictional world to the real one). Some positives, Jack Kirby was given credit for the character in the credits. The CGI to me almost looked dated and out of place for a marvel movie, especially in 2018, with some scenes reminding me of early 2000s animation. The music in the film was interesting, most if the kendric Lamar songs did not the moment it was used, but was there just to create links to our world in order to trick the viewer into making real world comparisons, which is interesting. Some of the accents in the film we're closer to fake African accents, seeing as most of the actors don't carry the African accent in their daily lives. Overall, Black Panther is an alright film that certainly did not deserve the praise it received from critics and is ultimately going to be remembered not as a cultural milestone, but the 20th or so movie before Infinity War. Not as exciting as Captain America Winter Soldier, but not as boring as Thor: Dark World as far as action goes. Overall okay film, very average but enjoyable for fans of superhero movies and the MCU.","Black Panther",2664,4.1,1.6

I actually liked it more than thor ragnarok. sadly though I will forget about this movie once infinity wars comes out.OH i forgot I liked Lupita Nyong'o, she was good.","Black Panther",2666,4.1,1.1
"2667",2,"  At this point, I don't know if Marvel/Disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive. This film (like Aladdin) made me question my reality in the sense that it presented so many stereotypical, cultural subtleties that I became paranoid of my perspective of culture as a whole. This is probably the most positive thing about the movie. That and Andy Serkis 'hamming' up the script.Like most reviewers, I found the pacing off at times. When I thought there was going to be some plot development in the 'club', oh oh no. The flimmakers probably decided to cut to action pretty quick so they did not have to make a compelling character.Marvel studios (once again) succeeds at dazzling the audience with beautiful people and great visuals to make you forget they are peddling garbage at the cinema.","Black Panther",2667,4.1,2.1

"2672",5,"  This is an amazing movie, it did everything right: Story was spot on, Villain was 3 dimensional, and the concept was executed perfectly. Beyond all that, what set this movie apart is that it focused on topical issues without being bogged down by them: Black identity, racism, immigration/refugee, militarism, and so on. It's more serious than most Marvel movies, but still retain the unique humor that people like. I honestly feel like this is Marvel's answer to Batman franchise of DC. Black Panther should be the hero of gritty social commentary, like Batman is the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order.","Black Panther",2672,4.1,-0.9
"2673",4.5,"  Plot: The film starts out, as most franchise starting films do, with a lot of exposition. The first third of the movie is world building. Establishing Wakanda, what Vibranium is, introducing characters essential to the plot. While world building can sometimes be tedious to sit through, you don't really have that with this film. The pacing is quicker than you normally see for this kind of world building but not to the point that it loses the audience or leaves them confused. The only flaw I can see in this part is that the origin of Vibranium is explained, but they don't really take the time to explain how the Vibranium based technology utilizes it. This, combined with overusing the Vibranium as a plot point at times, makes it feel like it's just a way for them to use magic and call it science. Probably could have been helped a bit with a throwaway line with some scientific mumbo jumbo.The second act of the film is where the meat of the story begins. The main conflict of the film is set up, the backgrounds of the antagonists are set up. This part is also paced extremely well. There's zero lag here, everything has a purpose, and the action sequences are well done. It almost has the feel of a James Bond film, right down to the cool gadgets (and Q-esque character introducing the gadgets), spies, car chases, and double-crosses. This is far and away the strongest portion of the film.The third act resolves the conflict. This is also really well executed, if a bit predictable. Stellar action sequences that would make Star Wars proud and all of the important story points tie up neatly (if a bit too neatly).Characters: The characters in the film are wonderfully written and well acted, particularly the secondary characters. If there's a flaw in the writing of the characters, it's that the secondary characters are so good that they make T'Challa seem a bit bland by comparison. But it works really well, especially in the portion of the movie where T'Challa is off screen for a while and they're expected to carry the story (and do it extraordinarily well). The villain is likable without sacrificing his ability to be threatening. He's complex in ways that you don't normally see from super hero movie villains (Loki being the notable exception). The secondary protagonists are extremely strong characters to the point that it takes some work to make you believe that they're in danger (which the film still manages to pull off) and when they are in danger, you're invested and care about them as much as you care about T'Challa, if not more. It's also refreshing to see strong female protagonists. When we see female characters as secondary protagonists in films, they're usually a damsel in distress plot-point, to be captured by the villain and saved by the male protagonist, or are little more than window dressing. These women are having none of that nonsense and the film is better for it.Effects and Cinematography: The film is beautiful. There's no other way to say it. From perfectly shot action sequences that immerse you in the moment to landscapes and sunsets. Everything captures your eye, nothing looks out of place, the effects are fantastic and never take you out of the immersive experience of the film, as can happen with a bad effect (I'm looking at you, Indominous Rex).Summary: It's a great film. There are a few things that could have been done better (Vibranium=Magic, predictable conclusion, and T'Challa being about the 5th most interesting character), but it's an immersive experience, well written, well acted, a strong underlying message that isn't heavy-handed, and a good set up for future films in the franchise.","Black Panther",2673,4.1,-0.4

"2677",3.5,"  Like a good portion of the past few Marvel solo outings, Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" could have been a great film, but it also just so happens to do at least a pretty good job at all of the aspects I was looking forward to upon walking into it. The action and effects are mostly effective. The world and tech are undeniably cool. The protagonist and antagonist are both supremely well-developed. But where a lot of the other recent Marvel solo outings fell short, this one does as well. The plot is at times questionably paced and not entirely well-thought-out. Some stylistic choices here and there either sucked me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way. And the humor, while definitely more toned down in this than in other recent solo flicks, also became grating over time. Still, ""Black Panther"" is not a bad film. Maybe close to great, even. But it's also yet another solo Marvel film that's left me with the same conclusion - the team-up's are still the most to me entertaining as of late.","Black Panther",2677,4.1,0.6

"2701",3.5,"  Black Panther 3.5/5 Stars. A solid addition to the Marvel universe, Panther is a bar-raising film in some ways, and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others. -Things they got right:It cannot be denied that this is a culturally important picture, with an almost all African American cast in a setting that is not U.S. slavery era or Malcolm X. The cast was awesome, especially the 3 female leads who mostly held this story together. Lititia Wright as Shuri steals every scene she is in. Danai Gurira , Lupita Nyong'o and Chadwick Boseman are all very charismatic and fun to watch. The art department for Black Panther deserves high praise. The costumes and gadgetry are eye popping. Character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes, and i really liked some of the supporting roles. -Things they got wrong:Where did the cool music from the trailer go? i guess it got cut. Otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place.Like the Soundtrack- i felt like the movie couldnt decide what it wanted to be. Are we trying to feel grounded in reality, are we diving into the crazy end of the pool like Ragnarok? Are we trying to be a solemn culturally aware film with an overall positive message or are we making bad jokes relating to memes that noone will remember in 10 years?Most of the CGI looked good, but sometimes it was used inexplicably, like they were trying to get away with shooting something that was supposed to be outside but couldnt make it happen. The story was not strong as far as the steps executed. i felt Disney's hand in some of this. Don't tell me you don't see Lion King all over this, i couldnt help it. i don't think they risked enough to differentiate the plot from dozens of other hero's journeys and it's a shame because Black Panther's history is interesting. So, overall solid, but not a standout. Better than what many franchises are doing these days but probably middle of the pack for me as far as the Marvel Universe is concerned.","Black Panther",2701,4.1,0.6
"2702",4.5,"  Along with Thor Ragnarok, I think this film is ushering in a new age of Marvel movies that can balance all the things that makes Marvel great in equal measure. It has the imagination and humor of films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man, as well as the emotion and moral dilemmas of films like Captain America Winter Soldier and Avengers:Age of Ultron. The characters are interesting and complex, the action scenes are amazing, the storyline is engaging, and I could write a whole novel on how gorgeous this movie is. The costumes, the scenery, the lighting, I could watch this movie without sound and still be completely enthralled. I see this being one of the films I can see over and over again without ever getting bored.","Black Panther",2702,4.1,-0.4

"2704",5,"  An excellent film! History, dynamics, drama, battle scenes are all at the highest level.","Black Panther",2704,4.1,-0.9
"2705",2.5,"  Rather slow. Weak and forgetabble action sequence/choreography. Actions at almost first half not well lit. The suit cgi looks more like magic rather than tech like what it supposed to be. And the final battle cgi when they both are falling and fighting are quite video-gamey. Interesting speech at the end of the movie thou. So all in all is rather overhyped.","Black Panther",2705,4.1,1.6
"2706",4.5,"  87/100""Black Panther"" dirigida estupendamente por Ryan Coogler sorprende gratamente a la hora de ofrecer no solo un espléndido entretenimiento, sino una película lo suficientemente inspirada y con personalidad, que sabe lo que quiere ser y que consigue ser (casi del todo) única; y eso se debe gracias al guion de Coogler y Joe Robert Cole quienes se empeñan por darle una voz propia tanto a los personajes como al lugar donde transcurre gran parte de la historia (Wakanda es increíble y aborda con mucho acierto temas sociales y políticos) que se beneficia del magnífico talento de sus actores (Chadwick Boseman como T'Challa consigue engancharnos al ver sus primeros pasos como monarca y Michael B. Jordan dota de gran autenticidad emocional a su villano; Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o y Leticia Wright ponen la guinda del pastel con sus bien perfilados personajes femeninos, tanto que llegan a opacar el también buen hacer de Andy Serkis como Klaw, Forrest Whitaker como Zuri y Martin Freeman como Ross), de la espectacular banda sonora y de una hermosa fotografía, aun cuando su acabado visual no termine de estar a la altura del film (hay algunos momentos donde no termina de convencer).","Black Panther",2706,4.1,-0.4
"2707",3.5,"  Lots of fun, great characters, another solid Marvel movie.","Black Panther",2707,4.1,0.6
"2708",4.5,"  Strengths: Director Ryan Coogler had a lot of faith put in him to helm this movie after only directing two prior films. And yet, he does a fantastic job with it. He nails the action sequences and the big set pieces in a way you'd expect from a more seasoned director of this genre. They did a fantastic job of making Wakanda look breathtaking. It is a wonderful place and has me excited that it will be a partial setting for Infinity War. Cinematographer Rachel Morrison made sure Wakanda was impressive. It was more visually stunning than more famous utopias like Avatar. Moving into the performances, everyone delivers. Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) is a great lead, bringing a coolness and vulnerability to the role that was needed. However, the show stealer is easily Michael B. Jordan (N'Jadaka/Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens). The best villains are the ones who have a good claim to actually being right in what they're doing and you could easily sympathize with this character. Every single time he's on screen, you're captivated. It's incredible to watch, especially if you (like me) have been a fan of Jordan since his early work. The other supporting actors are all great. The standouts are the surprising Sterling K. Brown (N'Jobu) in a small, but poignant role, Letitia Wright (Shuri), and Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia). Seriously though, they're all great. Not only that, but even the lesser characters get fully developed arcs and are well-rounded. Throw in a tremendous soundtrack and you've got a winner. Weaknesses: My biggest gripe with the film came from the character W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya). Daniel did fine in the role, but his character arc felt kind of rushed. I understand the motivation behind it, but he goes from our protagonist's best friend, to turning on him too quickly. He ends up feeling more like a nuisance than anything. Also, because Jordan was so great as the villain, I do think a bit too much time might've been spent on Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue). Granted, Serkis was good, but not getting much of Jordan for the first portion of the movie left me wanting more. These are minor qualms, though. Overall: There was so much hype surrounding this film and they managed to live up to, and surpass, most of it. The performances, set pieces, direction, action scenes, and soundtrack were all stellar. This is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie that we needed at the right time. One of the best MCU films ever, which is saying something.","Black Panther",2708,4.1,-0.4

"2714",5,"  I will admit given the current political climate and what people had been saying, and not being a fan of the main actor ( I tend to find him stiff and borish ). I even heard it was the best MCU movie BEFORE it was released ( Overhype before release usually bad sign, RE: The current Star Wars Movies, anything with Rhianna in it ) so I had real low expectations. I was sorely mistaken, I wouldn't and won't say it was THE BEST MCU movie EVER.. ( like others ), but it was well written, well acted. Yes, its a mainly Black cast, Black actor, etc.. But thats neither the focal point, nor in anyway something you ""think about"". In the same way The Walking Dead is not about Zombies and you forget about the Zombies as you get engrossed by the story and the acting, the same is true of Black Panther. The story is set in Africa, so yes the characters are African, and the country is African, and the story line revolves around this African country. They happen to be black, because they are African thats it. There are social elements injected into the story line but not in what you would expect. Is this the BEST Superhero or MCU movie.. ? No, thats simply hyperbolic, Is it some blacksplotation MCU movie railing ""Against the man"", Nope not that BS either. What it is is a great Superhero movie, and in my top 2. Behind Dr Strange. Becuase that movie set the bar... Overall great movie, great writing, and goes without saying great visuals","Black Panther",2714,4.1,-0.9

"2716",4.5,"  While not a flawless film, Ryan Coogler's take on the MCU proves to be one of their best films. Including one of their most fascinating stories, fully realized characters, stunning action, and great performances from Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and a standout, yet charismatic turn from Michael B. Jordan.","Black Panther",2716,4.1,-0.4
"2717",1,"  I was amazed when I saw that the Gimp from Pulp Fiction got his own movie, but it was a big disappointment when I found out that it's just another one of these vapid Disney Marvel movies. Just your standard, inane Marvel fare, skip it and watch it on a Sunday morning when you're fighting off a hangover and you need to turn off your brain for 2 hours.","Black Panther",2717,4.1,3.1
"2718",0.5,"  Richard Spencer (the alt-right guy behind the whole Charlottesville thing) loves it for it's portrayal ethnonationalism and so do the critics. The alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing. Pathetic.","Black Panther",2718,4.1,3.6
"2719",3.5,"  Good mid range Marvel movie. Spent a bunch of time on the 'wonders of Wakanda', but otherwise did a good job with character development -esp supporting characters. Marvel tends to do a better job than DC on this stuff vs DC 'stuff blows up real good'.There is a bit of 'slight whitey', but whatever. It isn't like there aren't movies in the past that went the other way. More like blacks trying to decide their role in the world, which is what drives the plot conflict.","Black Panther",2719,4.1,0.6
"2720",5,"  If you don't go see this movie your gonna regret it","Black Panther",2720,4.1,-0.9
"2721",0.5,"  This movie is overrated as fuck. The CGI looks like ass and most of the dialogue is inconsequential to the story. I thought the mish-mash of African cultures was distracting (I can only assume some white studio executive approved it all without knowing much about the cultures themselves), and the vibranium was a plot device with no limitations that just made the main characters immortal, therefore all the fight scenes had no real stakes, and fixed all the other problems in Wakanda. The movie failed at being a good superhero movie, because there weren't enough fight scenes and the one ones we got we mostly CGIfests that weren't that interesting, and it didn't work as a political drama either because the forces superhero themes distracted from a political and emotional connection, and the ideas of racial injustice were watered down. It didn't help that it was all implied either; there is no scene detailing the racial tension anywhere in the movie, which could have added some more compelling narrative as opposed trying to establish T'Challa as ruler or whatever (which took way too much time in the movie). I would have liked to see Kilmonger's story expanded because he was the only good part of the movie. His backstory and personality were interesting but underdeveloped. I think it would be really fun to see him succeed and get the vibranium weapons out of WakandaThis movie had a lot to improve on. It wasn't terrible but all of you fanboys piss me off because this movie isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. ""It's representation of black people in mainstream culture that we haven't seen before""I'll give you that, this is an important cultural moment. I hope we get more black and minority representation in movies because of the success of this movie. But I also hope in the future those movies aren't super boring","Black Panther",2721,4.1,3.6
"2722",2.5,"  another dull marvel movie. If you enjoyed the other mcu films you will probably enjoy this. Its mostly free of the terrible disney humor and has a good setting. Not much here if you're already tired of these films. pretty average","Black Panther",2722,4.1,1.6

"2724",4,"  Marvelously realized, an heir to the throne must not only fend for his people, but right the wrongs of his legacy. A taught, fresh action fantasy that kicks down doors in all the right ways. *If you liked: Rogue One, The Hunger Games, The Force Awakens, Game of Thrones.","Black Panther",2724,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2725",5,"  So great to see one of my three most favorite Avengers on the big screen, along with Thor and Captain America. Film is pretty much a standalone MCU movie, which is fine, but they do give a great background story for the history of Wakanda. Boseman as the Black Panther was outstanding, gives off the regal vibe the character should have. Loved all of the action scenes, and I didn't think too much was given away in the trailers, except for the Seoul car chase. The villains were outstanding, between Klaue and Killmonger. Serkis and Jordan delivered wonderful performances.","Black Panther",2725,4.1,-0.9
"2726",4.5,"  Culturally significant comic book cinema that looks fantastic and is loaded with lots of great characters. While the movie has many strong females in the plot and a dignified moral leading man , the story is up-staged by the lovely presence of Michael B Jordan as the villain. you can't take your eyes off the dude....","Black Panther",2726,4.1,-0.4
"2727",5,"  I saw it. I loved it. The layers of themes happening in the movie -- revenge, identity, defending the crown, embracing female leaders and strengths, AND a majority Black cast! This is the first time I've left a movie feeling so invigorated and good about myself. I was able to identify with so many of the characters and situations. And the fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I'm going to see it again.","Black Panther",2727,4.1,-0.9

"2731",4,"  Visually-stunning and topped-off with stellar performances all around and incredible action sequences, Black Panther in some ways lives up to the hype. The story, however, could've been tied together a bit more. Definitely NOT a 97%, however.","Black Panther",2731,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2732",1.5,"  Just another mediocre marvel movie. CG a B- at best. A string cast, but not enough to save the movie. A story line that in this day and age should be being questioned and or considered the antithesis of what so called progressive minded people want. Yet the media spin machine is making millions for the folks behind marvel universe.","Black Panther",2732,4.1,2.6

"2735",4.5,"  I had a few issues with some of the seemingly rushed or exagerrated character motivations (most notably Wakabi and Killmonger, the latter of whom's rage really borders on unbelievable and psychotic, despite his ability to successfully pull off a major coup) but other than that, Black Panther is a FANTASTIC epic of royal blood, kings, and kingdoms, that successfully updates the Hamlet narrative in a way that pushes the boundary of Hollywood gatekeeping and provides a truly entertaining spectacle.","Black Panther",2735,4.1,-0.4
"2736",4,"  This is not a great movie, but it is hilariously entertaining. Not so much the Black Panther himself (he's boring with his daddy issues) but the supporting cast. Letitia Wright's witty sister, Martin Freeman's Caucasian comic relief, and, most of all, Michael B. Jordan's Angry Black Man from Hell villain with his jarring, slang-filled American accent (his final words must surely win the Unintentional Humor of the Year Award).","Black Panther",2736,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"2738",4,"  This is a very good superhero movie. The performance were excellent. But a lot of details lacked explanation, and resolution. If Wakanda is a hidden peaceful wonderland in the middle of Africa, why do they still have warring tribes? Sounds like they haven't evolved beyond the outside world from which they're hiding. And if Killmonger is the product of a Wakandan and a white worman how did his ancestors throw themselves into the sea from slave ships? Was his mom raised on a white-slave ship? They don't explain how vibranium can apparently do EVERYTHING, which is OK, but smart (ass) guy Stark should have ALSO figured that out, since Captain America's shield is made from the same stuff. DEADPOOL: still the best superhero film, since it refuses to take itself seriously.","Black Panther",2738,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2739",4,"  A tier 2 Marvel character that ended up delivering a tier 1 movie!!Hard to find fault with this flick. Great acting with bold characters. Good story line that followed safe but entertaining pacing. The only misstep would be the almost Ikea type innovation lab. Powerful technology and yet, it was all presented on a fold away table with a hint of teen bedroom on a budget - surely a culture that could produce a stunning technological masterpiece as the holographic cockpit could afford better lab furniture.But, that goes to show how well polished the rest of the movie was where an apparent mis-step on set design was all that irked. Every character felt meaningful. The baddie and good guy interaction never strayed too far into comic book blah - they had emotions that were believable and transient beyond their role. And as for the supporting cast - you know it is good when they never felt like they were there to be bit parts. They became characters worth watching in their own right.The whole ensemble of characters jumped out of the screen with such clarity and visceral realism that even in 2d, you felt whole absorbed into their world. Roll on BP2!!","Black Panther",2739,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2740",5,"  Wow. Fantastic costuming, excellent dialogue, powerful supporting characters, amazing portrayals, cool special effects. There was not a single bad moment in this movie. I'm not really an action flick fan, normally, but I've been loving some of the superhero movies and this one is, breadth-wise, the best yet. I had only one jarring moment, and that was the music used when T'Challa meets his father at the Panther tree (for lack of a better nonspoilery description) the first time. I'll probably see this in the theater twice, and I hardly ever see movies more than once on the big screen. Even the minor characters were awesome, and the sweeping shifts in locale were well done. A new classic.","Black Panther",2740,4.1,-0.9
"2741",4,"  Fun film overall. I would've liked to see more of T'challa with his father. Killmonger was the best part of the film.","Black Panther",2741,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2742",2.5,"  The Preview for the movie didn't grab me and I went into this movie with the same expectation as Ant Man. The difference was that Ant Man actually surprised me and was a fun movie to watch. Black Panther felt more like a political statement and after about an hour into the movie I was checking my watch. It really didn't lead up to Infinity Wars at all, which I think was strange since that is the next movie to be released. I am a huge Marvel Avengers series fan and own all the movies. Winter Soldier, Thor Rag, Avengers, Civil War, Guardians 1 are at the top of my list, but this might be the first Avenger series movie I don't buy.","Black Panther",2742,4.1,1.6

"2758",1,"  The first third of the movie is very good and compelling. It then becomes increasingly boring with very little investment in any further character development or nuance. There is almost no super hero action and the character arcs all seem built upon making sure each character gets their big triumphant moment without enough investment to make it meaningful when they do so. There is very little black panther in this black panther movie and our hero loses almost every fight he is in only winning by sheer luck at the last second in most. Overall this is a sub par superhero movie with some good moments and a nice political narrative that carries the film in spite of all its other flaws. In the end it is boring however and the final ""epic battle"" is lame and without tension.","Black Panther",2758,4.1,3.1

Sure, there are spots were the film works for a few minutes, but as a whole, Black Panther just isn't very good. Really can't understand how so many critics love this one and how anyone would give this 10 stars. My advice is wait for the digital/dvd release and save your money.","Black Panther",2765,4.1,3.1

"2773",1,"  Worst Averagers movie","Black Panther",2773,4.1,3.1
"2774",1,"  I bought into the hype and saw Black Panther tonight. Based on the Rotten Tomatoes scores, this should have been the best movie of the year and one of the greats.I must not have drunk the right Kool-aid. This may have been the worst movie I've seen in years. It's got action and special effects but the rest is awful: The plot barely hangs together. It's hard to care about characters that are so weakly written. The audience walked out of the movie confused and low energy.You may win Political Correctness points for seeing and pretending to like this movie, but honestly, this emperor has no clothes.","Black Panther",2774,4.1,3.1
"2775",1,"  Not very good after all the hype. Sad to see most of the positive ratings are by people who have not seen it yet. This is misleading. Watch it then rate it.","Black Panther",2775,4.1,3.1
"2776",0.5,"  Looking at the Critic Reviews, I can't help but think how pathetic Hollywood is. 100%? Really? This movie was perfect? I love the virtue signaling bs. I'm won't watch it just because of the political nonsense. Let me know when we start making movies again.","Black Panther",2776,4.1,3.6
"2777",0.5,"  another stupid marvel movie. they are all the same why waste money and time","Black Panther",2777,4.1,3.6
"2778",1,"  Overrated. I don't recommend. Possibly on the bottom of Marvel movies.","Black Panther",2778,4.1,3.1
"2779",3.5,"  As a Disney investor, I really want this movie to be good, but movies are getting so politically charged and partisan, Im afraid its going to be another 'Last Jedi fiasco' full of Hollywood self righteousness and preachiness. I pray its not going to preach to me. Most poeple today dont care about a persons skin color, race, ethnicity, etc. Really we dont. Just be a decent human being please and stop 'white-splaining' us to death. A message is not what makes movies great, its the acting, the production and a story that can stand on its own. I cant trust the critics anymore.","Black Panther",2779,4.1,0.6
"2780",4.5,"  I am very excited for this one! I like the trailers so far, and I love the costuming and the cast!","Black Panther",2780,4.1,-0.4
"2781",1,"  It's a decent movie,but the hyped killed it","Black Panther",2781,4.1,3.1
"2782",1,"  After like 1/2 hour, the story becomes lame. No more surprises or twist after the reveal of MB Jordan back-story. Its too predictable & lame from that point. Action scenes almost until the last battle were all already shown us in trailers & thats all.Not hated it but it isn't a Marvel's entertaining & humorous style movie by any means. Felt like watching a classic bollywood movie.","Black Panther",2782,4.1,3.1
"2783",1,"  Really? Terrible. Nearly the worst Marvel film ever.","Black Panther",2783,4.1,3.1

"2785",1,NA,"Black Panther",2785,4.1,3.1
"2786",1,"  boring, cheesy low-rent effects, crap fight scenes, fake fake fake stupid worst show of the year, shoulda gone straight to video. Ratings propped up by trolls to fit a political agenda for a bunch of losers.","Black Panther",2786,4.1,3.1
"2787",1,"  truly awesomely AWFUL","Black Panther",2787,4.1,3.1
"2788",1,"  Very disappointing it lacked a lot of element that a marvel movie has a complete waste of time that only thing good about this movie is the snacks I was eating","Black Panther",2788,4.1,3.1
"2789",2,"  first time it was amazing but now its just getting old","Black Panther",2789,4.1,2.1
"2790",1,"  The CGI in almost whole movie look ridiclious Didn't looked real at all and it semmed peculiar about the villan and the overall story and triend to wrap it in an nutshell it wasnt up to the mark but it was a still good effort","Black Panther",2790,4.1,3.1
"2791",2,"  Can you just make a movie and stop adding in all your propaganda? Visually, the movie was stunning! Story was okay. Not really impressed.","Black Panther",2791,4.1,2.1
"2792",3,"  i guess I was expecting a better ,different movie because of all the hoopla.....this is typ[cal super hero fare.....bloodless fights,dead people alive again,plot that makes no sense.....I've actually avoided these movies for awhile,just because they're so pointless.....oh well.....what do I know...it'll make a billion dollars i'm sure....","Black Panther",2792,4.1,1.1
"2793",1,"  I didn't make it past the first act. The action was great, but the redundancy of the second king origin story was unwatchable; they showed the exact same fight scene twice in the first hour (fight to death, with MMA rules). I will try again when its out on streaming.","Black Panther",2793,4.1,3.1

"2798",0.5,"  Another mediocre marvel action flick, brainless action like the rest. but theyll call you racist if u dont like it, so reviewers are keen on over-hyping it for ""breaking barriers"" regardless of quality.","Black Panther",2798,4.1,3.6
"2799",1,"  eh, just another generic, by-numbers flick from marvel/disney","Black Panther",2799,4.1,3.1
"2800",1,"  Where are the user reviews for Black Panther?","Black Panther",2800,4.1,3.1
"2801",1,"  This is just another super hero movie being overly praised.As a superhero movie, it is nothing we haven't seen before.As a movie, its another horrible mess with tons of plot holes, uninteresting characters with 0 development and mess of a story. Despise of what most ""critics"" say, this movie has not brought us anything new.","Black Panther",2801,4.1,3.1
"2802",1,"  It's basically the same Marvel movie again only with different hero.","Black Panther",2802,4.1,3.1

"2804",1,"  overrated. The villain was better than the ""hero"" #KillmongerWasRight","Black Panther",2804,4.1,3.1
"2805",1,"  Overly hyped movie once again by the critics. Good thing I only paid $5 at the matinee because that's all this movie is worth.","Black Panther",2805,4.1,3.1
"2806",5,"  I'm open because I loved comics. I love the actors also and grew up on Marvel. Racial and political views are in almost every movie you see. You have to learn to choose what you get from movies and form your own opinions, separating biases, and appreciate story telling from the artists who worked hard to present it. I'm hoping for the best and excited to see the effects and CGI. Pass peace and love.","Black Panther",2806,4.1,-0.9
"2807",1,"  Utterly over-rated and desperately overhyped for reasons of political-correctness. Identity-politics has rugby-tackled the Marvel genre and won't let go. Oh dear. (Iron Man, all is forgiven)","Black Panther",2807,4.1,3.1

"2811",1,"  i am really getting tired of all the dry & dull humour in these movies & honestly the acting was terrible.","Black Panther",2811,4.1,3.1
"2812",1,"  Average movie at best. Wished it had tied in with the MCU as well as a bit of a hint towards infinity war.","Black Panther",2812,4.1,3.1
"2813",1,"  this movie was a real disappointment to me personally. It let me down and seeing a build up to Infinity Wars and it let me down with an uninteresting plot and storyline. It also failed to entertain or to mesmerise. Even the comic relief wasn't even funny. Kilmore was a poorly developed character that they gave way too much time too. I don't feel like this film had any too much bearing on the Marvel Universe.","Black Panther",2813,4.1,3.1
"2814",1,"  What a disappointment. The movie has about 20 minutes of really interesting action time and the rest is a total bore. Total cliche of a movie that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.","Black Panther",2814,4.1,3.1
"2815",1,"  Never laughed so hard, this movie is a joke .","Black Panther",2815,4.1,3.1
"2816",3,"  This movie is going to take the political thriller of winter soldier and civil war to a new level of awesomeness!!! Cant wait!!!","Black Panther",2816,4.1,1.1
"2817",1,"  More of a stand alone movie than anything addint to the MCU which is my biggest gripe. It makes T'Challa out to be a weak leader and I thought it was very one dimensional.I was expecting a lot more, yes there was SOME political leaning about black people but that didn't bother me. It was more just .... what was the point? That Wakanda will be sharing it's tech with the world now?Definitely dissapointed and the 97% rating from critics is like usual complete and utter crap that is already being dispelled. 77% user rating now and that will likely drop.Critis and Hollywood need to get a grip, the people of the world don't like the tripe they try to command people they like.2.5/5 stars for me, I'll watchg it when it is on HBO again, but it is no Thor or Dr. Strange or Iron Man, I will tell you that.I actually thought Black Panther had a much stronger, better and more fulfilling war in Civil War than he didn in his own moie.","Black Panther",2817,4.1,3.1
"2818",1,"  Too much drama and irrelevant teachings of imaginary African tribes.Barring few visual surprises, this one has absolutely nothing to offer.","Black Panther",2818,4.1,3.1
"2819",1,"  Most underwhelming and overhyped thing I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.","Black Panther",2819,4.1,3.1
"2820",3,"  Not as fun as I had hoped","Black Panther",2820,4.1,1.1
"2821",1,"  The WORST marvel movie I've seen. Acting terrible..Story terrible.. If you want to sit through 2 hours of political correctness run amok ... have at it. I think I'm done with the movies.. Hollywood. Look for this to tank next week.","Black Panther",2821,4.1,3.1
"2822",4,"  Pretty good film. For a Marvel film it was great, but I've grown accustomed to a lot of action and though this film had action the pacing in between was a wee bit too slow. Loved the spiritual elements, the geopolitical elements, and the family abandonment and the pain it can cause. Great message, good film.","Black Panther",2822,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2823",3,"  I'll see it, but I'm not expecting gold. It seems like it'd be just another forgettable film like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange.I doubt leave a lasting impact to me like the Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, Captain America, Ghost Rider, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil and especially Spider-Man (the superior series with Tobey Maguire, not the shitty ass series with Andrew Garfield) . . .","Black Panther",2823,4.1,1.1
"2824",1,"  This is a visual spectacle...the CGi parts...but can't, for the life of me, understand the wooden statue performances. There are Oscar nominated actors/actresses (and one winner) in this movie who are saying lines, standing in place, showing nothing. If this is what the director was going for, then success. If not, I can't see the big hullabaloo. The women warriors were outstanding in action sequences---but said little. Michael B. Jackson should have at least been nominated for Fruitvale Station--should have Won an Oscar for Creed, but this is nothing comparatively speaking. When I think of Lupita's scenes in 12 years a Slave, I am still moved---as well as Daniel Kalaayua in Get Out. These performances are nothing next to those mentioned. I don't get it.","Black Panther",2824,4.1,3.1
"2825",1,"  boring, slow and bad acting plus terrible dialogue","Black Panther",2825,4.1,3.1
"2826",1,"  One really over rated much hyped film, wouldn't waste your time seeing this bag of tripe","Black Panther",2826,4.1,3.1
"2827",4,"  Don't look at all these 1/2 Star rating. It's a huge group bombing it to ruin the audience score. This was a sold 4 star movie","Black Panther",2827,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2828",1,"  Awful effects, stilted acting and strange back story. I'm so tired of Disney's hype machine for these bad films.","Black Panther",2828,4.1,3.1

"2832",0.5,"  too politicized, as a movie, just another marvel thing","Black Panther",2832,4.1,3.6
"2833",1,"  I don't get the positive reviews. This movie does not meet the hype. The Disney machine must be doing its thing of getting everybody excited about a mediocre movie and calling it the ""best movie of the year"".","Black Panther",2833,4.1,3.1
"2834",3,"  Fairly good movie Hollywood typical","Black Panther",2834,4.1,1.1

"2848",1,"  Seen the movie, think real life lion king you'll get the plot. Found it slow, 1 fight repeated 3 tines, think this will drop off steep, after word of mouth. Infinity war please hurry up. Worst mcu movie so far, as bad as phantom menace talking trade federations. Only up point is showing strong women.","Black Panther",2848,4.1,3.1

"2853",1,"  Saw the movie. It was OK. It wasn't bad but I found it's Social Justice messages annoying and that really detracted from the movie. I think all the over-the-top reviews are simply based on a desire to see the obvious racially charged movie do well, not on the actual movie itself.","Black Panther",2853,4.1,3.1
"2854",1,"  Nope, not at all interested in this.","Black Panther",2854,4.1,3.1

"2857",5,"  This movie is better than you expected, Marvel keeps cracking these great movie one after another.","Black Panther",2857,4.1,-0.9
"2858",1,"  This movie was honest to god the most disappointing and least interesting Marvel movie I have ever seen. I feel this movie could have easily have been more interesting if they just spent more time on it. Black Panther is one of my favorite superheroes and when I watched Civil War I wanted to see more of the MCU version but I feel this movie took the amazing Black Panther from Civil War and made him boring. Also the movie is filled with deaths you don't even care about. *Spoilers* I feel Forest Winikers character was completely wasted. He got like 5 boring minutes of screen time and I feel like we were actually supposed to care about his death meanwhile I didn't. Also I feel the dialogue was a little out of place to. Especially when Forest Winiker was talking to Black Panther about how his dad created Kilmonger. Also I hated the constant switch in language from Wakandan 2 English. It made the movie overall confusing and hard to follow. This movie was overall disappointing and I found BvS more intereseating than this.","Black Panther",2858,4.1,3.1
"2859",0.5,"  horrible CGI, makes justice league look good","Black Panther",2859,4.1,3.6
"2860",1,"  Ummm, no. Very disappointed. I am not going to applaud this movie because there are a bunch of black people in it. It had a plot that has been done numerous times before...main character: I am king. Antagonist: No you're not, I am King. Antagonist takes throneProtagonist goes through some redemption process and takes back throne.The EndThink Lion King without the talent and crappy dialogue.Enjoy","Black Panther",2860,4.1,3.1
"2861",1,"  Meh. Just another cookie-cutter superhero film. Not anything novel or interesting enough to make me want to see it twice.","Black Panther",2861,4.1,3.1
"2862",4,"  Solid addition to the MCU. First quarter of the movie was slow but the backstory is necessary. It's not a fun and entertaining as GOTG or Thor Ragnorok but it's a solid movie.","Black Panther",2862,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"2863",1,"  Interesting but very by the books. No real surprises to grab my attention.","Black Panther",2863,4.1,3.1
"2864",0.5,"  This film looks sad...","Black Panther",2864,4.1,3.6
"2865",1,"  I did not see the hype in this at all. Felt very little in the way of caring about any of the characters or their decisions. I'm pretty sure the love interest subplot was an after thought cause I forgot about it entirely. Definitely wasn't anything to hoop and holler about, unless you're a fan of the Ape man and his ability to literally steal the show at every opportunity. Did not care for him being used as the only comic relief and the predictability of his actions. Wasn't the worst MCU film, I couldn't say it was worth the ticket prices though. Probably should have just waited for infinity wars.","Black Panther",2865,4.1,3.1
"2866",5,"  I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT WAIT! THE TRAILERS LOOK AMAZZZZIIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!","Black Panther",2866,4.1,-0.9
"2867",1,"  I was so hyped for this movie and it fell flat. The best bits were in the trailer and they switched the bad guys in the middle of the film!! It only got exciting 75% into the film....","Black Panther",2867,4.1,3.1
"2868",5,"  I saw Black Panther at Atlanta screening. It's the best superhero movie since Captain America Civil War. This one is an absolute must see. Everyone will love this movie. No question it will have a well deserved special meaning for anyone with African roots. I have never heard so much applause during the entire course of a movie. This one will have legs at the box office. I would put good money on this one breaking a billion worldwide.","Black Panther",2868,4.1,-0.9
"2869",5,"  I am thrilled and excited about this film for a variety reasons. As a woman, a mother, a person of color and child of the 80's who loves comics and super heroes, it means so very much. For me, it goes beyond the entertainment, the action and the fandom. It's the representation on the big screen that makes it so thrilling. When I was young, being a dark skinned black girl was treated like a crime. I was picked on, laughed at and called names because of my skin tone. But now, the amazing dark-skinned women in this film are revered, respected and seen as beautiful, awesome, kick-ass heroines. Coming full circle does not even begin to describe it. I can't wait to see it.","Black Panther",2869,4.1,-0.9
"2870",1,"  Many of the fresh tomato critics summed it up too well for me to compete. I'm glad that even with Disneys immoral pressure for them to rate it fresh they still list it as ""2/5,"" or say their true feelings in the review.","Black Panther",2870,4.1,3.1
"2871",5,"  Can't wait to see this!! The sad comments by alt-right idiots notwithstanding...","Black Panther",2871,4.1,-0.9
"2872",1,"  Too many racist undertones . I could've been a great movie, but they didn't really follow the story and made raise a big part of it. Not worth your time or money","Black Panther",2872,4.1,3.1
"2873",1,"  Saw it, another comic ripoff. Nice to know there was no huge dog at the end of the movie. Now the critics are either on the take with the studio or they are trying to be PC for the people that read their reviews, that's the only thing that can explain such a ludicrously high rating for what amounts to be a very mediocre action flick.","Black Panther",2873,4.1,3.1
"2874",5,"  It's clear to me that most of the people in the ""Not Interested"" section seem racist as h*ll. All I see most of them saying that it's impossible for this movie to have gained critical praise and that it's an SJW conspiracy. A movie with an all Black cast can only be bad or average? Besides, this is no propaganda movie, it's a Marvel film that is SET IN AFRICA and doesn't intend to be anything more than that, and I'm looking forward to it.","Black Panther",2874,4.1,-0.9
"2875",5,"  im going to be seeing this february 16th lat @ night. ;)","Black Panther",2875,4.1,-0.9
"2876",1,"  Just returned from the theater, the movie was interesting, but not worth recommending to others. In regards to the marvel universe, Black Panther lacks a charm that makes others worth watching repeatedly. There was too much randomness that didnt align with a productive storyline. Was interesting, but I am not too enthusiastic about the film. 1-2 stars as a superhero movie, 1 star as a action movie in general.","Black Panther",2876,4.1,3.1
"2877",1,"  just an Ok movie, nothing special about this","Black Panther",2877,4.1,3.1

"2879",5,"  Oh yea I can't wait!!","Black Panther",2879,4.1,-0.9
"2880",1,"  It has some flashy visuals and everyone holds a spear, but the plot is silly and most of the characters other than the protagonist himself are unlikable, especially his sister. I really don't understand why this movie has managed to wow critics when better movies than it have been snubbed. Its not particularly beautiful, and it has a lot of obvious CGI. It was about as enjoyable as Thor: The Dark World. I can think of worse movies, but I can think of much better movies as well. Its definitely one of the worst Marvel movies, with the exception of the aforementioned Thor film. Its also better than Fan 4 stic. By the time it was over I was pretty bored. Wish I had not bought into the hype about this movie, since it is massively overrated.","Black Panther",2880,4.1,3.1
"2881",1,"  Bad character development. Sad to see some really good actors having to bear playing in this total failure.","Black Panther",2881,4.1,3.1
"2882",1,"  This felt like a Michael bay movie, they spent too much time on special fx instead of the dialog. I can't get over how awful the acting was. They tried way too hard, but thats how 99% of Marvel movies are these days. Marvel movies dont have the rewatchability like most other movies, especially Black Panther...Try again Marvel!","Black Panther",2882,4.1,3.1

"2903",3.5,"  This take on the book A Wrinkle in Time is done in a way that it feels like it will be loved more in the years to come than in the time it first comes out. The cast does a good job to bring up the message about how you are perfect just the way you are, but they do have some faults. Storm Reid definitely takes the cake with her dramatic performance but the rest of the cast falls a little flat but there characters are portrayed well. This movie needs a little more credit for it's visuals and performances. Disney took a risk with this movie and the final product is honourable even though it had faults.","A Wrinkle in Time",2903,2.6,-0.9
"2904",1,"  Although great scenery and special effects, the story line was bland and confusing. The way the story was told was to confusing and illogical. Things happened in the movie that were unexplained and confusing. Overall, I did not enjoy this film at all.","A Wrinkle in Time",2904,2.6,1.6
"2905",2,"  This was probably a good movie for young girls, but it was so slow and boring. I think I remember the books being more exciting, but this one didn't have much to it. I wouldn't waste your time watching this movie unless you have a young daughter.","A Wrinkle in Time",2905,2.6,0.6

"2912",3.5,"  The cinematic relationship within an adaptation between a book and a film tends to attract spectators to the film before knowing there's already a book at the first thought. Should I read the book before seeing the film to see whether or not it's a faithful adaptation? Or just go straight to the film and read the book another time? It should be based on the level of your own anticipation towards the upcoming film that you may like to see in the theaters before reading the book.""The Martian"" provided an interesting narrative while ""Wonder"" showed a heartening promise, and both films apparently proved to be subconsciously faithful without reading the book. Then there's Disney's latest dive into the fantasy genre as a new film form of imagination that's based off from the pages being transformed under Disney's magical hypnosis effect. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" was earlier compelling, along with a nice set of announced cast, by a possible mysterious concept that may be concerning time travel. But after seeing the film, after being compelled to check out the book a week prior, it may have been a different experience below the initial expectations.The story focuses on a young girl named Meg Murry, who been dealing with the disappearance of her father Dr. Alex Murry for five years since he somehow discovered a new planet. Her wandering little brother Charles Wallace meets the mysterious astral travelers Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which; then the two siblings, joined by Meg's classmate Calvin, got put into a dangerous journey to bring back their father under the travelers' guidance. It would take the kids' bravery to get through a planet that possesses the universe's evil soul, while the siblings' bond will be put into an eventual test along the way.From what I grasped after the first viewing, ""A Wrinkle in Time"" is rather complex to the meaningful soul mainly by the abrupt folds in the narrative flow, lacking any smoothness for the characters and the overall approach. It's another of those attempts made by Disney to be ambitious only to occasionally falter when created a visionary void with not much to fill the rest for balance that's relied on to the writing and the cast. The descriptive and emotional human soul noticeably provides repetitive moments for the heroine's understanding of the surrounding circumstance with communicated lines that tried to go beyond, only to turn out to be awkward writing.Thanks to the writing, it had affected the nicely-selected cast's somewhat squandered talents, but not their charms when putting literal-balanced energy into their characters. Respectively portraying the astral travelers, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling did their best to guide through a fantasy scale while radiating pleasantness in their known presence. Chris Pine energetically performed fine when setting the idea up and trying to put it all to rest. The main, most-energetic spotlight goes to the young stars Levi Miller and breakthroughs Storm Reid and Deric McCabe as they venture throughout the given flow and gave it their best than the veteran actors, though still part of the unbalancing. Simply put, the appealing cast performed decently at the film's average.Director Ava DuVernay's intention with this project besides going into the adaptation and having fun along with the rest of the cast is to express a message about diversity and female empowerment, with Jennifer Lee from ""Frozen"" as one of the writers. She did that nicely well amid the visionary void through the characterization under her own spin, especially when providing an insightful understanding as a moral pinch of social commentary salt - hence the meaningfulness. Accompanying that approach next to the characters, along with occasional unique style, is the elegantly fitting music that seems to express the encouraging spirit that composer Ramin Djawadi didn't need to heighten.So yeah ""A Wrinkle in Time"" may be questioned regarding its faithfulness to the unread source material as it would take another viewing then a reading of the book to fully grasp it. But as of the first viewing, despite not really being engaging as hoped, it's a decent film for visual entertainment with a subtext in the veins as part of the celebrated soul in reflection form. How flawed it may be at the front with qualities to enjoyably appreciate, it's more important that the cast and production crew had fun doing the project. Otherwise if they didn't, it would be a bad movie. (B)","A Wrinkle in Time",2912,2.6,-0.9

"2921",2.5,"  A rarity for me being so baffled by a movie; I highly anticipated A Wrinkle In Time from the moment I heard it was in production. Then came the amazing first teaser trailer which captivated me more in 1 min and 50 secs then the entire movie did. This was set to be a poignant movie experience and perhaps was, but not in the manner that I had expected. Walking into this movie I wanted to be transcended with emotion and evoked with deep thought, deep adventure and deep story telling considering the amazing cast featuring none other then Oprah. This was a poignant experience, but more of one that left me confused, unfulfilled and dumbfounded. All that deepness I hoped was left wading in shallow waters. Not having read the book I went to this with pure movie mindset and walked out thinking I may need to read the book to get even an ounce of what this story was. Major, and I do mean major, plot holes are all over the place in this movie that lacks any kind of depth to what is being told. The climax of the movie is perhaps the worst part of it all. Its much of a Alice in Wonderland story, however the journey is no where near as fun and charismatic. Kudos to the wonderful cast, however they could have pushed their characters a bit more. One gripping emotional moment shared between two characters/actors does bring you into the movie one extra much needed level. This movie left me so unsure of what to think that Im even more unsure of how to critique it or my thoughts of it. With all that said Im curious of its Rewatchability factor. If I see this on TV down the road would I tune in? Thats where my intrigue peaks itself. Watching it again I may be forgiving of the plot holes or the distributing climax. The journey is simple and could make for an easy movie to tune into at any point ,have on, and not need to pay close attention to while doing stuff around the house. For that it might make it worth the rewatch for the emotional, but short, moment during the climax. Basically, wading in shallow waters can be relaxing. Only time will tell for this one, so I guess it does live up to its namesake.","A Wrinkle in Time",2921,2.6,0.1

"2926",1.5,"  When I went to see this movie I was reallly exited but I really felt the movie was underwhelming . First of all the main actor (Storm Reid) was by no means terrible but her line are often delivered akwardly and that slows down the whole movie. The worst part about this movie is the special affects. Every thing in the show felt so fake and most of the time you can tell they are on a green screen and that takes from the magic.

"2932",0.5,"  Horrible movie. You get no sense of any real asveture. Aside from terrible story telling the movie makes no sense. Disney never should have removed the one element that binds the characters and story in the book: religion.","A Wrinkle in Time",2932,2.6,2.1
"2933",0.5,"  I... kind of hated this film, and I feel bad saying that as there are not a lot of films I end up actively disliking upon viewing them. ""It was different from the book"" is no excuse because it's a film adaptation and some of the best adaptations I've seen take the heart and SPIRIT of a book without strictly following it line to line! This film, however, does the opposite--it removes the best parts of the book and keeps the most weak parts, adding to the weakness and even dragging it out.You know the ""happy medium"" that has been pretty universally terrible in every version? Well the actor himself is thankfully more tolerable here but I hope you enjoy watching people struggle to stand on one foot for half an hour (this scene drags on and onnnnnn). Similarly, the magical creature ride on the first planet they get to... in the book at least they had a reason for the ride, to see the darkness and watch light literally fight it off giving you further insight into what sort of wonderous creatures the 3 lady's are and how important the battle is... in the film that is ALL gone and you're left with less than stellar CGI with our characters stupidly grinning in ""wonder"", omg, how magical! Except we're flying for no reason. And there's an action sequence because we were dumb, and that's REALLY what I wanted to see-- Our characters (who are all supposed to be extremely smart) doing STUPID things.I'm going to have to bullet point the rest of this because I have so many complaints:* The witches are introduced and are stunning and beautiful the entire film. This is a problem because they're supposed to be seen as quirky homeless-types at the start (the sort of person you might genuinely be concerned your 7 year old is talking to) which makes their later glory/wisdom all the more surprising and meaningful.* Talking/moving flowers. Puke.* Calvin is useless in this film. The actor does fine (though all he really has to do is smile and praise our protagonist at weird moments). I would have cut film Calvin entirely, he contributes nothing plot-wise or theme-wise.* Meg is not portrayed as actually smart, she's just a normal high schooler dealing with the stereotypical high school bully problems. Charles Wallace isn't smart either--but they TALK about how smart he is and we see him drawing so that must mean he's smart, right?! No, that just means he likes doodling like every other kid.* Bouncing ball Camazotz scene: not terrible, actually. But it could have been a lot more unnerving and creepy. It was way too short and transitioned into my next complaint--* Beach scene. What the actual heck. Charles Wallace just gets brainwashed... because. Why not In the book he gets taken control of because he CHOOSES to go to IT, his hubris and feelings of superiority gets the best of him and leads to his downfall. So much more interesting than ""number number, okay, I'm bad now for no reason.""* Meg and her father. I admit that I loved the scene of them reuniting, that was well acted and sweet. But god almighty the movie deliberately chose not to address him leaving Charles Wallace behind and Meg being furious at him because of it. In fact, Meg isn't given a moment of bravery and sacrifice CHOOSING to return alone to try and save her brother, instead she just screams and refuses to get whisked away in the first place. Look, I get time restrictions and all but couldn't you have cut 10 minutes of rock balancing and green creature flying to actually give our characters a meaningful arc?In this movie people are special just because people say they are, not because they actually say or do anything special. The whole time I watched it I just cringed or groaned. Heck, I'll even say that the crappy tv movie was better than this one because at LEAST they got some of the arcs right (and I can forgive some bad effects since they obviously didn't have the money).","A Wrinkle in Time",2933,2.6,2.1

"2936",2.5,"  Meg (the protagonist) was well acted and written. Sadly, the rest of the characters felt flat/2 dimensional. I realize it's primarily a kid's movie, but c'mon disney. This felt lazy as far as character development went. The incredibles and monsters Inc had much richer characters that the audience cared about.Someone said they'd bring their tween to watch this. I seriously don't think any of my nieces or nephews over the age of 10 would find it engaging enough to sit for the whole thing. It did ramble as someone else said here. ALL THIS SAID, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE FUN AND THE MESSAGE IS ONE THAT IS WORTH REPEATING.","A Wrinkle in Time",2936,2.6,0.1
"2937",1,"  It's just ... not good. Charles Wallace is ... after adjusting for him being just a kid ... actually surprisingly good, and Meg did well enough. Almost everyone else seems to have seen the script for the first time five minutes before the cameras started rolling (the exceptions are Reese Witherspoon and Zach Gallifianakis, who play characters that are kind of cliched, but at least don't just appear to be cold reading their lines off of cue cards).A LOT of liberties were taken with the source material, and ultimately there was only one of them that I would be willing to say ""Okay, that was different, but it wasn't clearly worse in every way"" (that being the Happy Medium). The movie lingers on scenes that should have been much shorter if not cut entirely. I can forgive the omission of Meg's older brothers but reducing Aunt Beast's entire species to a three second cameo is just intolerable.","A Wrinkle in Time",2937,2.6,1.6
"2938",5,"  A Wrinkle in Time, summed up in one word is Amazing. Amazing All-Star cast, amazing music, amazing CGI, amazing plot, and amazing sound/visual effects.

"2946",1,"  Disney Channel meets The View. Insufferable platitudes about the light and the dark and personal empowerment woven through a never-ending series of special effects, sprinked with a cringe-worthy way-too-young love affair, all created in the service of a feminist agenda. The perfect storm for a move that you have to work hard to sit all the way through. Oprah can't act to save her life, but her performance is Oscar-worthy compared to Mindy Kaling's, which has all the dynamic expression of a wet log. The director somehow even managed to drag all the personality out of Zach Galifianakis. As in all the feminist propoganda movies of late, the movie culminates in the father figure apologizing for his abandonment, even though in the book he did no such thing. Take a pass on this train wreck of a movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",2946,2.6,1.6
"2947",3.5,"  Disney's latest live-action outing is a dimension-traversing trip that centres on troubled 13-year-old Meg (Storm Reid), as she journeys into the unknown to find her scientist father (Chris Pine) who disappeared four years earlier. Joined by her precocious whizz-kid brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and cute-guy-next-door Calvin (Levi Miller), our headstrong but vulnerable protagonist must confront both evil otherworldly forces and her own life-blocking emotions. Aiming to be accessible for younger audiences, the core message - internal growth is impossible without self-belief - is hardly new, but, despite a completely on-the-nose delivery, it's also effective. The connective tissue isn't always the best (the less time spent thinking about plot machinations the better), though there's no shortage of thrills and wonder, or heart wrenching payoffs, in the numerous high-concept set pieces. There are parts of this movie that are unintentionally silly and a few of director Ava DuVerney's stylistic choices are dubious (over-sized Oprah Winfrey? standard black-tentacle incarnation of 'evil'?), yet enough goodwill is generated elsewhere to forgive these missteps. DuVerney doesn't hide her influences either, family classics such as Avatar and Wizard of Oz are obvious touchstones whilst more adult-leaning masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey and even The Exorcist (""Charles Wallace is not at home right now"") provide inspiration. Reid is an absolute gem in the lead role too, equally convincing in her self-destructive stubbornness to detach from the world as she is in the gradual shift to valuing her strengths, weaknesses and everything in between. She feels right at home sharing the big screen with Hollywood veterans such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, who, along with comedian Mindy Kaling, play an amusing trio of peculiar beings that guide our heroes on their trek. Ambitious to a fault, A Wrinkle in Time is a family-friendly fantasy saga that wears its heart on its sleeve whilst delivering a visually wondrous, if occasionally scatty, rollercoaster ride.","A Wrinkle in Time",2947,2.6,-0.9
"2948",3.5,"  While it wasn't the most compelling adaptation of the book, there was a lot of good going on in this film. As many have said, it was visually stunning. That's a given. The message was a great one, and one worth remembering whether you're a kid or an adult. It is certainly important to go in with a child's wonder, as some of the gaps or character traits are not as explained/fleshed out as in some other movies. However, the multilayered character portrayal of Meg Murray (Storm Reid) is as rich as one could ever hope for, and that, along with the story of her journey, is really what carries this movie. Good, and certainly worth watching, especially if you have a tween. Definitely worth a watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",2948,2.6,-0.9
"2949",2.5,"  I read the reviews before seeing it, so my expectations had been lowered and I'm glad they were. The visuals were amazing, but the story was just a bit thin, yet complicated at the same time if that makes sense.One recurring line in the film is ""I'm underwhelmed,"" which is ironic because that is exactly how this film makes you feel. They do all this work with the visuals, but the story line and the payoff are not worth it. As a result the film feels like a bunch of loosely connected scenes that you end up wanting to be explained or elaborated on, but they never get explained. For example, the scene we've all seen in the trailer of the suburban neighborhood where the kids are bouncing balls, lasts for just a couple minutes and we never return there. It is never explained. It is even curious why they would even cast an actress like Bellamy Young to play such a pointless character. There are scenes like that throughout the film.I never read the book, but I've seen movies that stay faithful to the book have this problem, so my guess is that's what happened: In trying to stay faithful to the original story, they created a movie that was just too thin and overly complicated and weird. Weird is okay, but you've got to add substance to justifiy it or at least make it make sense to the audience, which this film never does. By the end of the film, you're just like ""HUH?...Is that it?....2 hours and this is where we end up?""","A Wrinkle in Time",2949,2.6,0.1
"2950",0.5,"  The least they could have done would be to cast a few good looking people. I already can't stand Mindy and Reese. Such a dead bore","A Wrinkle in Time",2950,2.6,2.1
"2951",1,"  This movie is an honest waste of time, money, and the talents of Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, and Chris Pine. It doesn't give you time to believe what you're seeing on screen, asks you to suspend your disbelief to an insane degree, the child actors give unbearably stiff performances, nothing in the narrative ties together and it's all wrapped in a bow of mediocre special effects.","A Wrinkle in Time",2951,2.6,1.6

"2954",1,"  One of my favorite books when I was young. Very disappointing. Not appropriate for younger children!","A Wrinkle in Time",2954,2.6,1.6
"2955",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time is based on a beloved children's classic published in 1961. It's directed by Ava DuVernay, who was responsible for Selma, one of the best films of 2014. There's a reason that Marvel offered her the directing gig for Black Panther. This film has big names, a big budget, and big talent behind the camera with a focus on upping the inclusion at the Mouse House... so why is the movie so unfortunately awful? A Wrinkle in Time is one of the worst experiences I've had in a theater. I was so thoroughly unattached that I started questioning how something this bad was so beloved for decades by different generations of, what I must now assume, children with terrible taste.Meg (Storm Reid) is a teenager still dealing with the pain and anger from the four-year disappearance of her father, Mr. Murry (Chris Pine). He was a scientist trying to discover a new form of space-time travel powered by... love, I think. Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is stuck trying to rear he troublesome daughter and Meg's adopted little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Then one day they and Meg's crush, Calvin (Levi Miller), are visited by a trio of strange, powerful (aliens? witches? fairies? spirits?) women: Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). They inform Meg and company that they know where her father is. They must travel the universe to save him, battle the source of negativity, The It (no relation to Stephen King), and maybe learn a thing or two about accepting one's true self, faults and all.Oprah as Dragonball Z?A Wrinkle in Time is simultaneously over complicated and meaninglessly shallow. I was baffled throughout the entirely of its near two-hour running time trying to make sense of anything. The story felt like it was written by computer that had been programmed with the scraps of genre storytelling as an exercise. There is no real internal logic that holds everything together, which makes every moment feel arbitrary. The story also lacks another vital aspect every fantasy movie needs - clarity. The goal is for the kids to find and rescue Mr. Murry, but every step leading to this goal feels unclear. Scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment, you don't have any clue how what they are doing will lead them any closer to achieving this goal. Every scene just asserts itself, and then something happens, and then something else happens, and then it's done. Hey one minute the kids are going to talk with flowers because, for whatever reason, they're the little gossips of the plant world. Then Mrs. Whatsit turns into a plant mantis goddess giant. Then the kids hop on her back and fly, and then fly on her while she's also flying, and then one kid falls off, so whoops, but the gossipy plants catch him. And then none of that matters. Even the villain is a nebulous concept of negativity designed to link up with a character's personal journey. There's a plot insofar as stuff happens and then it doesn't. The rules of this universe are never properly established. Anything is just anything in this movie. The final planet, where they do indeed find Mr. Murry, could just have easily been their first stop. If a fantasy movie doesn't properly orient the audience to its world and rules, it's only a matter of time before that same audience checks out, frustrated and uninterested.Afterwards, I did something I hardly ever do and ventured to read the Wikipedia summary to discover what was in the original story by author Madeline L'Engle. Surely the screenwriters must have butchered this oft-touted children's classic. To my surprise, the summary of the book is pretty close to what ends up in DuVernay's film, with some slight modernizing and name changing (I wonder why DuVernay might not have wanted the Big Evil Source of All Negativity to be called ""The Black Thing."" Hmmm.). I think maybe the book was never good but was liked by kids, and then they remembered it being better and passed it along to their kids, and so on and so on, until somebody finally runs screaming through the streets, trying to get everyone to realize the harsh reality.Another factor that doesn't seem developed or helpful or fulfilling are the three magical beings played by Oprah, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon. It feels like they're more award show hosts constantly changing their wardrobes than characters. They offer very Oprah-like self-help platitudes about acceptance, courage, and self-actualization. I felt sympathy for each actress being wasted, in particular Kaling, who speaks only in quotes and a plethora of reaction shots where she practices a wise expression. Witherspoon is definitely overdoing it and Oprah has settled into being talk show Oprah. They felt like rejects from a discarded Alice in Wonderland movie but with less personality. I think you could cut all three out of the film completely. The only meaningful way these three characters impact the plot is as expositional devices, but even that is whimsical nonsense.Speaking of exposition, oh boy is this script really bad when it comes to dialogue. There's an early scene that exists purely to inform the audience about the Murry children and to be eavesdropped upon by Charles Wallace (that name deserves to belong to a tax attorney or a serial killer). ""She's smart but hasn't been the same since her dad left,"" says one teacher. ""Yeah, but that little brother of hers, he's got potential but he sure is weird."" The conversation feels painfully inauthentic and transparent. Don't these teachers have other students of equal interest at the school to discuss? The Murry children's father disappeared four years ago and they're still talking about them this sloppily? The final film is stuffed with these moments, with characters transparently telling the each other who they are or how they should feel at all times. The pointless romantic sidekick, Calvin, is literally introduced as coming over and saying, ""Hey I sorta know you from school, and I felt like I should be here,"" as if he could feel the screenplay calling him. Also, Meg just happens to live next door to her chief bully in school, who is still bullying her every day for whatever reason. It's been four freaking years since her father left, and apparently this still offends this girl on a daily basis? Most of the dialogue made me wince.It will sound mean but we need to talk about the bad child acting in A Wrinkle in Time. In the modern age, after Room, It, and The Florida Project in particular, there really is no excuse for bad child acting. If you cannot feature quality child actors, you aren't looking hard enough or that may be a fault of the director's own abilities. McCabe (Stephanie) is, in particular, a bad choice to carry much of the movie's emotional climax at the end. He even gets possessed by the Bad Negative Force and must channel menace. It comes across more like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum in a store. Much of the conclusion hinges on tight close-ups of McCabe bellowing. It's unfortunate for everyone. Reid (12 Years a Slave) fares a little better but is relatively inexpressive, going even beyond the general withdrawn nature of her character. Miller's (Pan) character serves no purpose. He offers no skill or breakthrough for the plot. He is just there, blank-faced, and providing PG-rated prepubescent romantic tension. Or perhaps Meg really needs to hear the strong encouragement from the voice of an attractive white male in order to finally personally succeed?DuVernay's direction has some nice, sweeping visuals but the movie as a whole feels far more awkward and misapplied with its budget. Some of the special effects are shockingly shoddy for this kind of major release from Disney. The fantasy worlds feel like holdovers from other fantasy movies with little memorable distinction. There is one effective moment visually that stands supreme, and that's when the trio encounter a suburban neighborhood populated with Children of the Damned-style kids all bouncing balls in sync. Their individual mothers come out and march in the same eerie synchronicity, and it's the best-conceived and executed piece in the film. It's also one of the few sequences where the editing is a benefit. The editing is conspicuously poor. Early on, when Mrs. Whatsit had first introduced herself, every cut failed to match, every camera movement created a disconnect of space, and it generally felt off. It didn't get better from there. When you notice the editing, unless you're in a Scorsese or Aranofsky movie, it's a bad sign.In many ways, this film reminds me of the misguided, flabbergasting, and fascinating failed passion project that was 2014's A Winter's Tale. I could dissect that movie and its multitudinous of wrong-ness for hours. With A Wrinkle in Time, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to enjoy the movie and root for DuVernay being given the reins of a major studio film. I loved Selma and diversity behind the camera is hard to come by in Hollywood, let alone a woman of color given this sort of platform. Sadly, it feels like DuVernay wasn't quite ready. A Wrinkle in Time gave me nothing to engage with early on. I didn't care about the characters, the plot felt like it was being made up as it went, the rules were unclear, the dialogue was inauthentic, there was no sense of momentum, and when it does accidentally stumble into something slightly interesting, it quickly moves along again. It's about the power of love overcoming the power of negativity. I don't know whom this movie is for. Children will be bored. Adults will shrug. This movie doesn't work on a fundamental level and it left me bored. I closed my eyes and dreamed of a better movie but it never came to be. My dear father, who had the misfortune of enduring this experience with me, turned to me during the end credits and said, ""I am now going to treat you... by taking you far away from this movie.""

"2959",3.5,"  File under: solid popcorn flick with an AWESOME message and lots of heart. As a film goes, this is a visual masterpiece. I love DuVernay's choices top to bottom. I can't tell why it doesn't fully work for me, but I've seen it twice now with my 13 year-old daughter (who LOVES it), so something is working! It feels to me like it was cut a little too much. Like it should have been 10-20 minutes longer with a little more time spent on Meg's personal transformation. But whatever, I'm looking forward to owning this Blu Ray, and I hope that it gets released in 3D!","A Wrinkle in Time",2959,2.6,-0.9
"2960",2,"  This movie seems a bit full of itself. It relied too much on colorful special effects and had WAY TOO MANY closeups of the characters looking around in faux wonder and amazement for a beat or two too long. The story should have been relied on more and the grandiose vision of the director less.","A Wrinkle in Time",2960,2.6,0.6
"2961",0.5,"  Terrible. We walked out. Unwatchable.","A Wrinkle in Time",2961,2.6,2.1

"2963",1,"  Horrible, artless, unimaginative attempt that has killed all the charm and excitement of the story with a plot that is impossible to follow and close-up cinematography that makes you seasick. Oprah's glam, 70s makeup is clownish rather than bewitching, and the child actor for Charles Wallace is not up to the task of delivering his characters adult-like brainy dialogue. A big-budget disappointment.","A Wrinkle in Time",2963,2.6,1.6
"2964",1,"  One of the worst movie adaptations since Avatar the Last Air Bender or Eragon. There is little to no character development, no explanation of what is going on or why just some vague suggestions. The story is boring and overused with barely any actual plot.","A Wrinkle in Time",2964,2.6,1.6
"2965",3,"  This movie tried to put a message across about light and dark and the impact on our universe but itnfell short in so many ways. Acting wasnt great and there were chunks of content missing to help put the story together. Sadly disappointing.","A Wrinkle in Time",2965,2.6,-0.4
"2966",1.5,"  The acting was terrible and the message of the film was beat over our heads. There was zero nuance.","A Wrinkle in Time",2966,2.6,1.1
"2967",1,"  This movie was a total car crash. I found it hard to make sense of, and the supernatural themes were not appropriate for a children's movie. It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time.","A Wrinkle in Time",2967,2.6,1.6
"2968",1.5,"  I thought this movie was going to be a big shining diamond for Disney, but I was wrong. This movie was a big stain on the book movie category. it leaves out many scenes from the book and the trailer. The ant and string scene was in the trailer but wasn't in the movie. But anyways Calvin was probably the most boring part of the movie with his actor giving no energy into his role.","A Wrinkle in Time",2968,2.6,1.1
"2969",3,"  I wanted to like this from the start; the ideas and the visuals were worthwhile & the characters charming, especially Storm Reid and a very mad Reese Witherspoon. However, the ""big bad"" was frankly quite shit, made no sense and was easily beaten. Also...the ending?","A Wrinkle in Time",2969,2.6,-0.4
"2970",0.5,"  Absolutely the worst Disney movie I ever saw. If I could have walked out without climbing over other people's knees, I would have. Just horrible.","A Wrinkle in Time",2970,2.6,2.1
"2971",2,"  I am a fan of teaching people that love is better than hate. The world could definitely use more love. My issue with this movie is that all of the good characters are syrupy sweet to the point of nausea and they speak in this fairytale aloof Mr. Rogers, Glenda the Good witch, Joel Olsteen kind of way that drips with insincerity. Good people aren't always slow sweet talking human beings. You can be down to earth and good. The movie was just too over the top and quite predictable. I am very dissapointed to have waited a year to see this. The previews made me look forward to it. Instead, it was a total letdown.","A Wrinkle in Time",2971,2.6,0.6
"2972",4,"  How could people not like this movie?? It is good and the children can act!","A Wrinkle in Time",2972,2.6,-1.4
"2973",1.5,"  Other than the kids trying to find their dad the plot did not make sense to me. Actually my sister and I were roasting the movie the entire time watching it for it's weird dialogue and some of the characters bizarre behavior.Actually at times with these characters it was like watching a comedy improve troop trying to make sense of a fantasy film than whimascal characters. I like Harry Potter movies but this particular movie made no sense to me. I think there was some sort of well meaning message. I'm sure the book is way better the problem is trying to condense it in a 109 minute film leaving some vital details out on how their universe works. Visual wise Oprah's eyebrows were the only eye-catching thing in this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",2973,2.6,1.1
"2974",3,"  The movie needed more runtime. 109 minutes was not long enough to properly explain the complexity of the themes presented in this film. With a full 130 minutes, Ms. Ava would have produced a complete film. This was rushed, and maybe that is because she was not afforded the same budget as her male and Caucasian counterparts. Interesting decision by Disney, who produced and distributed this film.","A Wrinkle in Time",2974,2.6,-0.4
"2975",5,"  A thoroughly solid and beautiful tween movie. Ignore the reviewers who can't remember how it felt to be entering the turmoil of teenage years.","A Wrinkle in Time",2975,2.6,-2.4
"2976",0.5,"  CRITICS giving 3/5 stars are being generous. There was no suspense, likeability of characters, and no comedy. The only positive of this movie was some of the special effects but even they weren't enough to stop me from nodding off. I am so DISAPPOINTed with disney and have no idea how this passed an approval board.","A Wrinkle in Time",2976,2.6,2.1
"2977",2.5,"  Storyline just wasn't there. Acting was good and the effects great but without a flow of the story it just falls flat.","A Wrinkle in Time",2977,2.6,0.1
"2978",3.5,"  Although most of the cast were spectacular, this film fell short in terms of authenticity to the book and two out of four of our party fell asleep during the movie. Visually it was amazing but something did not wow us.","A Wrinkle in Time",2978,2.6,-0.9
"2979",2,NA,"A Wrinkle in Time",2979,2.6,0.6
"2980",2,"  This movie reminds me of boxcar kids in a fantasy world, which is not complimentary.Pros: Good messages. Power of love is pretty cliche, but liking yourself is important. The visuals are stunning. The actors are quite good, especially for child actors. Actually, all the acting is pretty good.Cons: So if this were a movie for adults, the plot holes would be unforgivable. Nothing that happens makes sense and the made up rules don't stick around long enough to be kept track of. Every character trudges along as though the plot fairy has a string tied to them, with no sense of motivation. Again, I get that it's a kids movie but could you at least try to build something resembling a story and not just a bunch of excuses to show off special effects?Overall: Not terrible, but definitely not good.","A Wrinkle in Time",2980,2.6,0.6
"2981",1,"  Ugh. So bad for so many reasons. Skip it. Save yourself the time, pain, and money...","A Wrinkle in Time",2981,2.6,1.6
"2982",0.5,"  This movie ruined going to the movies for me. I have never written a review on rotten tomatoes before but if my review stops even one person from going to see this horrid film, then it is worth it. I used to feel bad about those in the film industry lamenting how they can no longer make money. If you are going to put out this garbage then your industry deserves to fail. Wrinkle in Time is a good book, why not just follow the story line and do less with special effects. The premise didn't make sense, the dialog was preachy and also made no sense. Even my children who watch utter garbage thought this movie was awful. Just the worst movie I have ever seen. When movies cost close to $100 for a family of 5 to go to, they have to be better than this. This may be the last time I take my family to the movies for awhile. This movie just ruined going to the movies for me.","A Wrinkle in Time",2982,2.6,2.1
"2983",1,"  so pathetic to see people try and defend this","A Wrinkle in Time",2983,2.6,1.6
"2984",2,"  Wow, what a bad movie. I've never read the book but I get the feeling that this reads better than it looks visually on film. Beautifully brought to life in terms of graphics but completely lacking any type of coherent meaningful plot that actually entranced and brings you into the world (or universe) they are trying to create. It makes no sense, is boring, rambles all over the place and everything comes a bit too easily at times to our main protagonist whose performance while good isn't great (though compared to Levi Miller's awful performance she's exceptional). To be fair the messages regarding family are good but unfortunately their meaning is overshadowed by everything that is wrong with this movie. Not a good watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",2984,2.6,0.6
"2985",4,"  Basically the best live action Disney film","A Wrinkle in Time",2985,2.6,-1.4
"2986",1,"  One of the poorly produced moves I've seen. The little actor playing Charles W. I quite bad. Oprah should stick to doing inspirational speeches. Ware of my money. So upsetting.","A Wrinkle in Time",2986,2.6,1.6
"2987",3,"  a movie of grand proportions but falls a bit short of expectations - all while spreading the good word of light vs darkness. I personally took away the metaphor of depression. Also, fabulous costumes!","A Wrinkle in Time",2987,2.6,-0.4
"2988",1.5,"  I'm just gonna keep this review short and sweet, just read the book. This movie doesn't explain about this world and what the hell happens, the only way to know what's happening in the movie is to read the book first. I watched this movie three times, with people with and without knowledge of what has happened in the book, and we all got the same conclusion, and that would be that this movie explains nothing, and does a lot of telling but not showing. I also feel like the first 2/3 of the movie was just rushed, and the character acting was just horrible, however the last 1/3 of the movie seemed like a entirely different movie, because the quality was actually really decent.....although I feel like there was just a lot of filler, which is strange because we they didn't explain a lot or even show the character personality that much.","A Wrinkle in Time",2988,2.6,1.1
"2989",0.5,"  Worse effects ever. The story line is hard to follow and jumps around. I was excited for this movie ??","A Wrinkle in Time",2989,2.6,2.1
"2990",0.5,"  Awful. I really don't know how Disney let this release, I guess they had to? So so bad.","A Wrinkle in Time",2990,2.6,2.1
"2991",2.5,"  Good special effects and good cast.... but was hard to follow.","A Wrinkle in Time",2991,2.6,0.1
"2992",2.5,"  The film is wildly ambitious in some areas. However, for the most part fails to take advantage of it's cast, setting, and narrative; missing the mark in every sense.","A Wrinkle in Time",2992,2.6,0.1
"2993",1.5,"  Disney really came up short with A Wrinkle in Time. There was so much opportunity with no follow through. The worlds that could have been created where endless but the worlds that were created where mundane. Although there was a lot of star power, it could not make up for the inexperienced acting of the three protagonists. This is a challenge with any film relying on child actors, but it was especially brought to light throughout this movie when big emotional scenes were missed due to poor acting.Similarly, the movie missed the mark with the messages it was trying to convey, getting lost in creating nice sound proverbs that main the film feel a fake deepness to it that most children would not understand. I am not a child, so I am not sure how children respond to the film. However, I feel it lacks any true imagination and does not give children anything solid to grasp on to.","A Wrinkle in Time",2993,2.6,1.1
"2994",3,"  I was finally able to check out Ava DuVernay's film A Wrinkle in Time during a rainy Thursday matinee after several weeks in wide release. At this point, there is not much to the plot synopsis that I can really add. But, the screen presence of Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon as celestial guides speaking of light, energy, vibes and balance help elevate this Disney sci-fi fantasy into an enjoyable and mystical film that left me with a feeling of exhubeation long after the screening was over. By responding to A WRINKLE IN TIME in such an emotive manner, I know there are others as well, so I am completely perplexed why this film has a low rating on movie sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb? The female driven narrative about finding your own light, despite of other people's darkness is a positive message for a younger Disney audience and makes A WRINKLE IN TIME far from a terrible film.","A Wrinkle in Time",2994,2.6,-0.4
"2995",5,"  great movie! cant wait to see it again.","A Wrinkle in Time",2995,2.6,-2.4
"2996",5,"  I am struggling to understand the horrible reviews. I certainly get someone just not liking the movie, but hating it? I actually loved it. I had to step away from the book and take the movie on its own merits. I thought the cinematography was gorgeous and the message beautiful. I'm not sure why we can't just embrace a message of hope and love. We kinda need that these days. The message I took was that the ""It"" - darkness- whispers words of fear and hurt and anger in our ears, and feeds on them. And that we each must overcome our own process of mind to help build light in the larger world. Even as Meg stood facing her brother in the ""darkest of all minds""...you could see the neurons firing, telling her all the worst she had ever thought of herself. She had to listen to the voices of light to overcome those thoughts, and by doing so she could help Charles Wallace win as well. Beautiful, I think. Watching love and courage of self win is not such a bad way to spend a couple hours.","A Wrinkle in Time",2996,2.6,-2.4
"2997",3,"  Adapting a book into a movie is a thankless job. Choosing which details to include, and how to translate the text into film can go wrong in so many ways. Purists will pounce, often rightly, if the movie fails to stay true to the book. This is the crux A Wrinkle in Time finds itself in, and although it has the ingredients for a great movie, the best it ends up being is a good enough movie.People remember the sense of wonder and imagination the novel inspired in them the most, so naturally, that area is A Wrinkle in Time's strongest suit. Director Ava DuVernay does a commendable job visualizing the majestic worlds of the book. While each scene is shot in a real environment, like the redwood forests of California, the more fantastical elements are recreated through CGI. The CGI blends in perfectly with the live action. Unfortunately, it's also up to the audience to imagine where the characters are, as the editing sometimes loses track of them. On a more subtle level, the costume and makeup design convey the otherworldly nature of the adult characters by changing ever so slightly as the movie goes on. What really impressed me, however, was how the characters are framed. Instinctively, you can tell how they are feeling or whether they are good or bad based on how they're positioned in relation to the camera.Although the movie does a good job adapting that wonder, it's attempt at adapting the story itself is a little more mixed. Personally, I thought the book's dialogue was clunky, particularly in the beginning. For the most part, the script updates the 50 year old dialogue, so the characters speak more like modern audiences. Granted, Charles Wallace still gets called Charles Wallace every single time another character addresses him, but what are you going to do about that? The beginning also spends more time depicting the lives of the Murray family and explores their characters, which makes the decision to cut out Aunt Beast's scene later in the film so puzzling. Given that A Wrinkle in Time has trouble pinning down its pacing for most of the movie, it makes sense to maintain the climaxes' momentum by streamlining it into a single scene, but in doing so, the movie loses a key opportunity to delve into its characters and make their story arcs resonate with the audience. It doesn't help that the themes are sanitized of their religious undertones. On the other hand, the message of diversity that takes their place is laudable. Which is a shame, because DuVernay is a talented director, and Storm Reid shows potential as a child actor. Ultimately, though, A Wrinkle in Time is an OK movie when it could have been a great one.","A Wrinkle in Time",2997,2.6,-0.4
"2998",0.5,"  Was not very good, very disappointing to of had so many great actors involved. Just another bad movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",2998,2.6,2.1
"2999",0.5,"  During the movie, I debated either sleeping or leaving the theatre as a more effective use of my time. Can I sue to get two hours of my life back? There's a wrinkle in time I'm interested in.","A Wrinkle in Time",2999,2.6,2.1
"3000",5,"  What is wrong with people? This was an amazing movie, that was really faithful to the spirit of the book and hit most of the major, important plot points. It was visually dazzling, emotionally authentic, the characters well-developed, and the plot tight. I loved every minute of it. Plus, they were in giant brain... how cool is that?!","A Wrinkle in Time",3000,2.6,-2.4
"3001",0.5,"  worst movie of the year (possibly all time). boring cast, almost fell asleep until i died from laughter once they started flying on a lettuce cup and running away from tiny plants while in a very strange dress. first movie i've walked out of in years. this is absolute shit.","A Wrinkle in Time",3001,2.6,2.1
"3002",1,"  This film should be called ""A Wrinkled Mess."" The narrative is all over the place and the movie tries to rely on feelings instead of plot. The only problem? You're never pulled into the story long enough to feel anything.","A Wrinkle in Time",3002,2.6,1.6
"3003",2,"  To say that A Wrinkle in Time is disappointing, is an understatement. It was nothing short of a complete mess of an adaptation of a book. It was the classic over-the-top melodrama adorned with the pomp of tiresome lyricism and loud colours, to make up for uninspired, self-indulgent and distracted direction. While it was visually stunning, thanks to amazing CGI support, the story telling left much to be desired. Perhaps directors need to be reminded over and again, that less is more, and good story-telling is far more important than special effects. One long condescending overload of a self-help motivation video on self-worth.","A Wrinkle in Time",3003,2.6,0.6
"3004",5,"  I loved it, saw it twice. Gorgeous visuals and a touching story about a girl connecting with her dad. The dialogue is real, the people authentic (except for the Mrs. of course).

"3005",1,"  Why is Zachary Galifianakis a wise sage in this movie and why is Oprah Winfrey unenthusiastic about every line she delivers?2/10. Wackiest movie I've seen in my life. I kid you not, it was like a two-hour fever dream or acid trip.","A Wrinkle in Time",3005,2.6,1.6
"3006",2,"  Unfortunately, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" not only manages to fail of being a faithful adaptation to the books, but it also fails as a movie. It's cluttered, has some pretty horrible CGI sequences, and some pretty poor acting. A lot of them are okay, but it's tricky to have a movie rely so hard on kids, because if their acting is poor, the whole movie will feel that way. And sadly, some of them really miss the mark. It's not the worst movie of all time and it will have its fans, but it's too cluttered and ridiculous to match up to its best-selling source material.","A Wrinkle in Time",3006,2.6,0.6
"3007",1.5,"  Half-decent performances from some, but generally flat cinematography and a hole-riddled plot makes this movie rather, for a lack of a better word, bad.","A Wrinkle in Time",3007,2.6,1.1
"3008",0.5,"  This was literally the WORST movie I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time or money on this. I lost $25 and 2 hours of my life I can never get back. I would rather go to the dentist than watch this movie. I really wanted to walk out but I stayed until the end hoping it would get better. It never did and in fact got worse as it progressed.

"3013",3.5,"  This adaptation of a novel from 1962 was simply too short while being too faithful to the original book. This left only three planets, and two major characters. However, if you focus on Meg, the main character, and her journey, and her strength--and discard all connections to the book--then it's a well-acted sci-fi fantasty coming of age story staring a black woman protagonist.

"3017",4,"  I saw this film at Cineworld on Saturday, and there is rather a lot to say about it.The storyline may not be clever and perfect, but there are parts of the story that are understandable and emotional - and there may be too many special effects, but if there weren't, it'd be a dull and disappointing film, right?I also liked the acting and the unexpectedly beautiful happy ending. Although it isn't as good as Beauty And The Beast, if you like fantasy and sci-fi, A Wrinkle In Time is worth a watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3017,2.6,-1.4

"3023",2,"  This movie looked great and had some spectacular moments but was so nebulous and free flowing that the character development fell pretty flat and it was difficult to become invested in the abstract string of events.","A Wrinkle in Time",3023,2.6,0.6
"3024",3,"  I never quite understand how people rate movies. I didn't want to go this see and assumed it would be bad, but I was wrong. It was fun. It is a movie made for kids and if you go in and just hope for something exciting to watch with a happy ending and a good message, you will not be disappointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3024,2.6,-0.4
"3025",2.5,"  Amazing CGI, but dissipointed at the end. It didn't have many similarities with the book, and the movie boring at times. Overall, it did not live up to expectations.","A Wrinkle in Time",3025,2.6,0.1
"3026",1,"  We just went to see ""A Winkle in Time"" - what a waste of time.. I was so disappointed. I can say I believe this is the first Disney movie that left me wanting my 2 hours of time back!","A Wrinkle in Time",3026,2.6,1.6
"3027",1,"  Walt Disney must be spinning in his grave. I have never ever seen anything so dreadful in my 60 years plus of movie going! Unbelievable bad direction, poor acting, bewildering script ,passable special effects but the relentless screenfilling close ups of all and sundry had me chewing on the back off the cinema seat in frustration verging on apoplexy. Film is intended to have an effect on the viewer, this sure did three days later I am still seething with rage at such crass rubbish. Bring back hanging!","A Wrinkle in Time",3027,2.6,1.6
"3028",3.5,"  Even though ""A Wrinkle in Time"" relies heavily on exposition and is slow moving, it is still a visually gorgeous, inspirational, heartfelt, and emotionally resonant film that benefits from its strong acting performances, touching musical score, and dedicated direction.","A Wrinkle in Time",3028,2.6,-0.9
"3029",0.5,"  The terrible movie didn't even correspond with the book, i hated it and the casting was terrible","A Wrinkle in Time",3029,2.6,2.1
"3030",2,"  This movie was visually stunning, however the story was lost in all the glamour. The movie eventually became a bit of a bore. There was clearly a slew of information missing from the story. It was as if the story line came in third to the many stars of the film and the film's Glitz and glamour. I wish I'd waited for it to hit cable.","A Wrinkle in Time",3030,2.6,0.6

"3035",0.5,"  Lacking to say the very least, they had a great opportunity to make a fantastic film and they totally fell short. Extremely disappointing...","A Wrinkle in Time",3035,2.6,2.1
"3036",2,"  There was a moment in Wrinkle in Time when it showed darkness reaching the Earth and slowly engulfing it. It gave me chills. The movie suddenly felt extremely timely. It may have been talking about a popular girl struggling with an eating disorder and a great student being bullied by his father to do even better. But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios. In fact, much of the film felt as if they were already thinking about a ride as they were making it. My 9 year old liked it. Hopefully it will make him want to read the book. Then it will be worth it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3036,2.6,0.6
"3037",2.5,"  Fun but slow in some areas.","A Wrinkle in Time",3037,2.6,0.1
"3038",1,"  This film is a complete disgrace. The 2003 version was a far superior. This adaptation is all visuals and no substance version of this class novel. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is all over the place, and the actors are completely waisted. The only redeeming quality is the visuals.","A Wrinkle in Time",3038,2.6,1.6
"3039",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time certainly works hard to bring a modern take on the classic children's novel. Although the movie is visually pleasing and has a great cast, the film does fall somewhat flat.","A Wrinkle in Time",3039,2.6,-0.4
"3040",0.5,"  My girls read the books & were excited to see this. In short: SAVE YOUR MONEY & TIME with kids and do something else together. AWFUL!","A Wrinkle in Time",3040,2.6,2.1
"3041",0.5,"  This movie is only fit for small children who haven't read the book, because the CGI will enthrall them. Any adults should be ready for an uneven and ultimately unfulfilling experience. Heck, they didn't even truly explain what a tesseract was, and that is the basis for the title of the book! If I could give this 0 stars, I would.","A Wrinkle in Time",3041,2.6,2.1
"3042",1,"  Colorful,But very boring and Useless","A Wrinkle in Time",3042,2.6,1.6
"3043",1,"  Wow, that was bad. No world building at all. No character building. Things just happen with no explanation. An hour into the film and everyone acts like they've already been on this fantastic journey when they've only really moved a few feet. It feels like it was written and directed by people who had no handle on the source material, so they changed it into something they could understand.","A Wrinkle in Time",3043,2.6,1.6
"3044",5,"  Look, if you go into it expecting it to be anything other than a feel good family film, you're gonna be disappointed. It is a family movie based on a children's book and it did a wonderful job of being that. There are so many people saying basically that it wasn't nitty gritty enough who need to chill. It was visually stunning and an absolute joy to watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3044,2.6,-2.4
"3045",2,"  This had the potential to be good and had high hopes being done by Disney. The story was confusing and spent too much time trying to impress and not enough time developing a good story. Star power and messaging over a quality movie that did justice to the classic book was a big miss for my family.","A Wrinkle in Time",3045,2.6,0.6
"3046",2.5,"  They slaughtered this book. Very hard to follow/understand if you haven't read L'Engle's classic.","A Wrinkle in Time",3046,2.6,0.1
"3047",0.5,"  If you are a fan of the book the 2003 version while not perfect and much lighter on effects is better","A Wrinkle in Time",3047,2.6,2.1
"3048",3.5,"  They didn't explain a tesseract or wrinkle in time - the parents occupation was not explored enough which confused my grandson. However, I really enjoyed the movie, it was a visual banquet.","A Wrinkle in Time",3048,2.6,-0.9
"3049",0.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is truly a disappointing mess. Though the actors give it their all, it cannot make up for a lack of a coherent story, or a confusing and generic antagonist. Even the visuals sometimes fail to amaze. Overall a terrible movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3049,2.6,2.1
"3050",1,"  Terrible Adaptation. Awful Writing. Bad Directing. Bad Editing. Great Visuals. Painful to watch. Acting was handicapped by poor casting and dialog. Messages were twisted, sub plots were overly brief and messages were shallow at best. Disney had all the resources to make this great and they failed. Major disappointment. Worst movie I've seen in a while. Two scary for little kids(demonic possession, child abandonment) No explanation of science, no explanation of title other than a 3 second animation. Terrible attempt at scientific justification for flying was ""lift"" and for getting picked up and thrown by a tornado - ""physics"". Writers might have attempted to involve a real scientist for the writing. Also these writers should be given an award for worst writing ever. This movie could join ""The Room"" as a cult classic for how bad it is. Looks like the glitter budget was bigger than the writing, editing, and directing budgets combined based on the product.","A Wrinkle in Time",3050,2.6,1.6
"3051",4,"  I thought the movie was pretty good! Obviously, there were plenty of differences from the book, like the fact that the Murray family has a whole set of twins that were excluded from the screenplay. Whatever, they aren't necessary, especially if there won't be a sequel (which I don't foresee happening). Having read the books when I was younger, Ava did a pretty good job with this film. It was stunning, and the kid in me really enjoyed it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3051,2.6,-1.4
"3052",3.5,"  While the movie has it's flaws, as any movie does, all in all, I quite enjoyed the visuals and the characters. It hit the right tone , in my opinion, of coming of age, and the feelings of inadequacy many teens go through as they become young adults.","A Wrinkle in Time",3052,2.6,-0.9
"3053",5,"  Beautiful story and visually stunning","A Wrinkle in Time",3053,2.6,-2.4
"3054",0.5,"  Loved this story as a kid and I really wanted to like this movie, but it is terrible. I can't recommend it even if you loved the story as a kid.","A Wrinkle in Time",3054,2.6,2.1
"3055",3.5,"  Nice story putting a female character at the centre with skills in science and maths but still able to use love to beat hate as she learns to believe in herself and her abilities. This type of message is a good one to put out there to young girls as they grow up and find their place in the world themselves. The special effects will also appeal to younger audiences and look magical if you suspend your disbelief.","A Wrinkle in Time",3055,2.6,-0.9
"3056",5,"  A wrinkle in time was my favorite book in childhood. I thought that the film beautifully adapted the novel.","A Wrinkle in Time",3056,2.6,-2.4
"3057",3.5,"  I really can't remember all of the finer details from the original novel, but I felt this movie hit many of the required elements and themes. Visually, this movie had many well-designed scenes and effects. And from an overall narrative perspective, I felt there was a lot of emphasis placed on making sure the viewer could sympathize with Meg's difficult teenage life. Therein lies the crux of the movie. The CGI spectacles and science jargon are really just background material to highlight what ""A Wrinkle in Time"" is really about - the power of love and accepting oneself to make a difference in the world (not about whether girls can do science too or any other mis-guided view of this movie). Where I get a little hung up on this movie is trying to nail down who is the target audience. Clearly teenagers, teenage girls, and people who read the original novel are the intended audience; but the spectacle level of this movie seems like it is aiming to reach a broader audience. I just don't think the casual moviegoer will get much out of the high-minded physics concepts or the fantastical elements which seem oriented toward younger viewers. And younger viewers are likely to be disturbed by the actions of Charles Wallace and The It at many points in the back half of this movie. To be honest, the movie reminded me of a mashup between movies such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Interstellar, and Spy Kids. As one who formerly read this book I got a fair amount of enjoyment from the movie based on fun character interactions, the inclusion of key elements from the novel, beautiful imagery, and several touching thematic moments which spoke even to me as an adult. I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a movie that explores new worlds, anyone who read the novel, and anyone who enjoys young adult themed books or movies. For everyone else, check it out for a matinee or rent it later.","A Wrinkle in Time",3057,2.6,-0.9
"3058",0.5,"  Gets half a star, only because I didn't actually walk out.but only because my kids were there and they didn't like it either. Was just a poorly executed film from start to finish. I couldn't stand the kid cast as Charles Wallace, nor could I stand the cheesy CGI that was pervasive throughout the film. The constant usage of pop songs throughout actually took away from the scenes after a few times. The writing was terrible as well, it was so cringeworthy I felt sorry for the actors. I read the book a long time ago but didn't recall it being like this. They made the father quite cowardly and I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters. The pacing either dwells too much on a lengthy dialogue full of cheese or just jumps all over glossing over plot. I was shocked upon learning this had a 100m budget. Either they did not use up the budget or 100mil just doesn't buy what it used too. In any case, I think a competent director and screenwriter would have accomplished much more with less. This would have worked out much better as a 1 hour animated TV special for children.","A Wrinkle in Time",3058,2.6,2.1
"3059",1.5,"  The visuals of this movie are absolutely stunning, and the score is awesome. Chris Pine's acting is also phenomenal and is totally believable. However, that doesn't help save the movie from its many, many, many flaws. I found Meg to be a very unlikeable character (which is ironic considering her name is Meg), all the lore and backstories were uninteresting to me, and Calvin had no purpose is this movie apart from being the token white boy. And Charles Wallace...just...UGH!! I know he's only six-years-old, but I REALLY wanna beat him up. Instead of being cute and intelligent, he comes across as a know-it-all and a really rude one at that. Honestly, one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen. Overall, I think this movie had the potential to be really great, but the plot and the leading roles' acting is what made this movie fall so very short.","A Wrinkle in Time",3059,2.6,1.1
"3060",2,"  This movie is a waste of time and talent. The concept of time is interesting but the delivery was poor.","A Wrinkle in Time",3060,2.6,0.6
"3061",2,"  This was just an okay movie. The acting fell flat in so many ways. I was surprised that Disney would ruin another stand alone film after Tomorrowland. The story was rather odd.","A Wrinkle in Time",3061,2.6,0.6
"3062",2,"  Very disappointed. A favorite book since it came out in 1962. Heavy handed, over-the-top themes. Uneven characterization between female and male roles - and I'm a very strong woman. Messy in general but some stunning photography.","A Wrinkle in Time",3062,2.6,0.6
"3063",2,"  Probably a good movie if you're stoned","A Wrinkle in Time",3063,2.6,0.6
"3064",1.5,"  Just a dull and uninspiring as the book. The actors seemed to have called in their parts, especially Oprah Winfrey. I would only recommend this movie if one needed assistance falling asleep.","A Wrinkle in Time",3064,2.6,1.1
"3065",3,"  I want a movie to engage me emotionally; make me care for the characters, and be immersed in the story. I felt like Wrinkle in Time made really heavy emotional demands from the start, and never let up. Half way through I was exhausted and desensitized, rolling my eyes rather than tearing up. On the upside, the kids dug it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3065,2.6,-0.4
"3066",3,"  I had high expectations for this movie especially because of the book. Unfortunately Director Ava DuVernay doesn't execute the movie wither her full potential and as a result the overall movie falls short of likableness in comparison to the beloved book.They should of focused more on the characters and the story and explanations rather than the visual effects.Overall the movie isn't as bad as the score.","A Wrinkle in Time",3066,2.6,-0.4

"3073",2.5,"  This is an ambitious attempt at creating a classic family film from a classic novel. The visual effects are breathtaking throughout but it seems as though these effects are favoured over any kind of strong story. The plot is almost a secondary product of the feature and any enjoyment taken from the film disappears when you begin to think about what is happening. Storm Reid in particular as well as the other child actors stand out among an array of phoned-in and annoying performances from their elders.","A Wrinkle in Time",3073,2.6,0.1
"3074",3,"  A landmark film, its resplendent visuals and a strong, emotionally anchored first act fizzle into disconnected second and third acts. Makes bold artistic choices (for Disney) as did the book. Not something I'd watch again but respect immensely.","A Wrinkle in Time",3074,2.6,-0.4
"3075",0.5,"  I have long loved the book ""A Wrinkle in Time"". I wanted to see this film as soon as it came out. It was not true to the book and that fact ruined the movie for me. Religion played a huge role in the book and to change Christianity for inclusiveness was not true to the book. I would not waste another penny nor will I recommend this for my grandchildren to see or anyone. I hope it continues to fail and maybe finally Hollywood will see the need to be true to the character of the book. I won't count on it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3075,2.6,2.1

"3092",1,"  ""A Wrinkle in Time"" had talent in its overall gorgeous look. Other than that, it lacks any noticeable strengths at all.While I sat in the theatre, Disney showed a PSA to thank the crew on such a great project, but after I rushed out, all I could think of is how much of a waste it was to have talented people working on such garbage. My rating does not reflect the controversies with the book, but just the movie itself. A Wrinkle in Time over foreshadowed the future, and there was no surprise that I was looking for. I can see how some people can connect with the Mrs.'s, but I personally felt relieved when they left the screen. As weird as it may seem, I and many others struggled to connect with the lead characters, despite their similarities to many other people. In all, connections were lacking, the theme of the story was an extremely non-risky move, and the rest of the departments in the film struggled to make such a poor idea good. I hope that we can somehow move such amazing resources in the industry to work on stories that we can all enjoy.","A Wrinkle in Time",3092,2.6,1.6
"3093",5,"  This was an amazing movie, it definitely deserves higher ratings than those which it has received. Extremely moving, incredible actors. I initially was scared that with such a celebrity-heavy cast, the movie might rely too much on the game of it's actors. However, the celebrities that they chose fit very well in their roles, the characters never had to change to fit the actors playing them. The cinematography was fantastic, everything was beautiful and other-worldly and truly captured all of the weirdness and whimsicality of the book. There are not many movies that can move a whole theatre to tears like this one did.","A Wrinkle in Time",3093,2.6,-2.4
"3094",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time is directed by Ava Duvernay and stars Storm Reid, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Levi Miller, Deric McCabe, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Pena and Chris Pine.The story is of Meg who loses her scientist father. He was experimenting with this strange idea he had that you could bend the universe and travel light-years in seconds.When three strange beings arrived in Meg backyard Mrs. Which Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who. Meg her Brother and Friend go off on an adventure through time and space to try and find her father.This is a visually stunning film sometimes and then sometimes it is also fairly horrible looking. There is no escaping it, some of the special effects and green-screen are extremely noticeable and they're not quite as impressive as I think this film thinks they are; especially for a Disney production.There are some very touching scenes most of them involving Meg's family, you really do feel a sense of warmth in their household and when her father disappears you feel for character. But from the first act to the third act the story is such a jumbled mess, it felt like the movie was missing something after the touching opening. That was the human touch, after the first act the film was just really a lot of Wow sequences that didn't really land.When it comes to the Children leading the film all three give good performances for the most part, Storm Reid who plays Meg is fairly good in the movie especially in some of the more emotional scenes, she doesn't really show a lot of surprise when the awe-inspiring moments are happening before her eyes which was a little strange, but she is very good as an awkward young girl who is not comfortable with her own self yet.Her younger brother Charles Wallace started off strong then a lot of focus was on his character neither the end and sadly this is where he fell off.But the over reliance of the younger cast pushes a lot of them to one side, some of them just get one or two scenes in the movie which was incredibly disappointing to see.I think there's a chance that kids today will see this movie and it will be there Hook, Hook was critically pan by critics in 1991, but kids from that era love it. This could be this generations Hook.","A Wrinkle in Time",3094,2.6,0.6
"3095",1.5,"  This movie did not have nearly as much action as thought while had a very confusing plot","A Wrinkle in Time",3095,2.6,1.1
"3096",1,"  A flop that flounders all the way to the end. The little boy was annoying from start to finish. Not much in the way of realizing a story, but there was some potential. There is a good scene with Galifianakis, but the rest is a luke warm mess.","A Wrinkle in Time",3096,2.6,1.6
"3097",0.5,"  Slow, plodding, muddling, how many more synonyms for moves likes molasses can I come up with. It's a shame really, that such a wonderful classic story came across so poorly. See something else.","A Wrinkle in Time",3097,2.6,2.1
"3098",1.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time reminds me of The Dark Tower, in that it is a bland, emotionless and totally boring mess. The acting is good and it is nice to look at, but I'd rather do my homework instead.","A Wrinkle in Time",3098,2.6,1.1
"3099",0.5,"  This movie is just bad. I went to see it to enjoy a family night out which is rare due to my work schedule. With no other choices at the time we saw this movie. The best way to describe this is a mashup of Bridge to Terabithia and Shark boy and Lava Girl. Save your money and if you want to watch it try to find it in a Redbox or wait a year and it might be in the $5 bin at Walmart.","A Wrinkle in Time",3099,2.6,2.1
"3100",2.5,"  this was fine; i never read the book so i don't have anything to compare it to, but it seemed like a very nice kid-friendly/family movie. the story's weird - i'm sure the book is much better. the cast surprised me, though; lots of big names. when Reese's character kicks the girl i laughed real hard, haha.","A Wrinkle in Time",3100,2.6,0.1
"3101",1.5,"  I really wanted to like this movie but in the end it was just a huge disappointment","A Wrinkle in Time",3101,2.6,1.1
"3102",1,"  Visually very colourful and sometimes awe-inspiring, but definitely a case of style over substance. With a weak plot that descends into nonsensical tripe and some bizarre character choices, the film ends up being too weird to be engaging, with things being weird just for the sake of it - the costumes are a prime example. The moral messages and acting are ok, but otherwise, it's a disaster.","A Wrinkle in Time",3102,2.6,1.6
"3103",0.5,"  A combination of horrid CGI with lackluster music, combined with god-awful acting and a terrible plot, makes Disney's ""A Wrinkle in Time"" one of the biggest faliures of the year.","A Wrinkle in Time",3103,2.6,2.1
"3104",2.5,"  Plot was pretty messy. It has a great message about self confidence and positivity, but overall it was mediocre. The colors, CGI, costumes, and make up were fantastic. It madethe movie for me. Not horrible, but not great either.","A Wrinkle in Time",3104,2.6,0.1
"3105",2,"  I expected more story elements to this film, I guess I was watching too many of their trailers lately that I've been knocked out into their unclassical motives. It's like the opposite of Doctor Strange","A Wrinkle in Time",3105,2.6,0.6
"3106",2.5,"  It starts great and for some reason it looses its storyline and gets rushed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3106,2.6,0.1
"3107",0.5,"  This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen In my entir life I would not recommend this to anyone. Complete waste of my life","A Wrinkle in Time",3107,2.6,2.1
"3108",0.5,"  I have never snuck out of a movie.... until now. Worst movie ever.","A Wrinkle in Time",3108,2.6,2.1
"3109",5,"  My daughter and I loved this film. My daughter loved it so much that she wants to see it a second time!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3109,2.6,-2.4
"3110",1.5,"  Slow paced and preachy.","A Wrinkle in Time",3110,2.6,1.1
"3111",0.5,"  Don't watch if you read and enjoyed the book. Low budget Disney movie with bright colors.","A Wrinkle in Time",3111,2.6,2.1
"3112",0.5,"  I really wanted this movie to be good. Unfortunately it was anything but. The 0.5 point I gave was for some great characters but the story and ideas in this movie were just ridiculous and made not sense at all. The storyline was all over the place and I feel that no character achieved anything in this movie. Worst movie I've seen by far.","A Wrinkle in Time",3112,2.6,2.1
"3113",3,"  Love time travel? Love classic literature? Love ripping on bad adaptations of stuff? Well today, ya might get to enjoy all three!A WRINKLE IN TIMEIn all honesty, I never read the book, so I had to familiarize myself with the plot kind've on the fly. It was ok, little dated, but entertaining. As for this new adaptation...At less than 2 hours, this film moves at a pretty steady pace, but MAN is it a head trip! (Pro tip: never watch this film on acid or even weed!) I did feel like I was missing a chapter or two of the story, even though we got the whole beginning, middle, & end, it was still a bit hard to wrap my head around. Pretty though.It's been a while since I read up on the story, so IDK if the film is 100% book accurate. But honestly, it was pretty entertaining.The cast were all well chosen & acted the HECK outta their roles. The three guides, the kids, the adults, the background characters, it was like the film was Dr Pepper, & you could see how each flavor fit into & improved the whole. The villain was non-traditional, the evil that is & must be part of the universe, which was an intangible threat, but you could feel it in your spine, which made for some pretty good unsettling moments.The visuals were (& I'm dead serious) a bit too acid trippy for my taste, but not bad. You could tell what was CGI, but that only added to the trip, along with some (I kid you not) practical glitter effects that REALLY added to the trip. This film would've fit right into the '60s & '70s Disney era.The music was an ok mix of contemporary songs; didn't add much, but it didn't take anything away either.Over all, I'd call A Wrinkle in Time weird, hard to follow, but never boring. 3 stars outta 5, some would argue it deserves more, BUT...that's why this is MY humble opinion, not everyone's humble opinion.PS. When it comes to time travel, I...think I'll stick with a Delorian or Tardis, less headaches.","A Wrinkle in Time",3113,2.6,-0.4
"3114",0.5,"  Did the screen writers ever actually read the book? And what about the make-up staff...were they all taking hallucinogens or just most of them. An absolutely awful portrayal of perhaps the greatest children's book of the 20th century.","A Wrinkle in Time",3114,2.6,2.1
"3115",0.5,"  This is the 3rd time I've tried to post a review for this awful movie. Save your money, it's screenplay-bad, acting-hammy, CGI-good.","A Wrinkle in Time",3115,2.6,2.1
"3116",1,"  An overwrought, confused mess with tons of plot holes. It tried way too hard and fell flat.","A Wrinkle in Time",3116,2.6,1.6
"3117",1.5,"  It may have some really cool shots sometimes, but for the most part it is only really bad CGI. But my main problem with this movie is that it is really, really childish.","A Wrinkle in Time",3117,2.6,1.1
"3118",0.5,"  Horrible! Disjointed! Horrible acting by top actors; that takes effort.","A Wrinkle in Time",3118,2.6,2.1
"3119",1,"  This movie sucks. Harp o can't act. Reese W was lame and KELLI from the office was miscast. Cheesy special effects. Captain Kirk seemed like he mailed his performance in. What a wast of money which will probably make my annual pass price go up because of all the money Disney wasted on this crap.","A Wrinkle in Time",3119,2.6,1.6
"3120",4,"  I do not understand all the negative reviews. I watched it in theater with the kids and enjoyed it. I think the criticism towards Oprah is unfair. She had a small but important role and she did full justice to the character. Same for Reese Witherspoon. She was fine in her role. I have not read the book so cannot compare. But did not find any portion of the movie boring.","A Wrinkle in Time",3120,2.6,-1.4
"3121",1.5,"  This is not one of those ""the movie is not like the book"" kinda thing. I didn't like it, and friends who didn't read the book didn't like it either. I wasn't expecting anything from this movie and I still got disappointed","A Wrinkle in Time",3121,2.6,1.1
"3122",1,"  I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I wanted to give Disney a chance with this material. Sadly, it just didn't work. Heck, Disney already made this movie once before, a TV movie that's honestly much better than this.","A Wrinkle in Time",3122,2.6,1.6
"3123",1,"  Should be retitled to ""A Waste of Time""","A Wrinkle in Time",3123,2.6,1.6
"3124",0.5,"  I'm so confused how this is even considered a movie. What a mess of a movie that makes no sense at all. I feel like it's more like a 2 hour example of what it would be like to be on drugs.","A Wrinkle in Time",3124,2.6,2.1
"3125",0.5,"  The worse movie of the year. Save your money. I have never read the book but I know I had to survive this 2 hours. The kid actress is very good though.","A Wrinkle in Time",3125,2.6,2.1
"3126",1.5,"  its liike putting b cliche with greaat visuals","A Wrinkle in Time",3126,2.6,1.1
"3127",0.5,"  Absolutely awful movie but took my 10 year old daughter who wanted to see it. Not even worth a free showing as you will be robbed of your time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3127,2.6,2.1
"3128",0.5,"  Hideous metamorphosis of a beloved book from my childhood to something completely distasteful. Why does disney insist on adaptations filled with political messages. Just entertain us.","A Wrinkle in Time",3128,2.6,2.1
"3129",3,"  i give this a solid 3 stars. remember this is based on a kids book, do dont treat it like even a young adult novel. accept it for what it is and enjoy the ride","A Wrinkle in Time",3129,2.6,-0.4
"3130",0.5,"  This was a made-for-Disney-Channel--kids-reruns-on-Netflix movie that somehow made it to the theaters. What bag of dog vomit!","A Wrinkle in Time",3130,2.6,2.1
"3131",0.5,"  Dad was not a coward in the book. poor dad gets turned into a coward in this poorly done adaptation). the message is peculiar. He is saved by courageous daughter. I struggled to understand why she did not chastise him for his cowardice. this was a poor plot choice for a childrens movie. I gave it half a start for visual effects. Reese witherspoon and oprah were very funny in their roles.","A Wrinkle in Time",3131,2.6,2.1
"3132",5,"  I think this movie captured the serious struggles we face on a daily basis. The dynamics in characters were impeccable - inspiring, and heart warming. The ""it"" they speak of in the movie proves mass consciousness, with Stephen Kings ""It"". There is an evil force that proves jealousy and anger etc that spreads across the world. The reviews on this movie is a pure example of this It that is taking over man kind. This movie was GLORIOUS and to everyone involved - job well done. This movie made me cry, laugh, and hug my loved ones tight.I LOVED it. The best lesson I learned is stay true to yourself, and love is the biggest weapon. Embrace your faults, always be kind.","A Wrinkle in Time",3132,2.6,-2.4
"3133",2.5,"  Saw the movie last night....I'm glad I read the book first. This modernized version didn't help tell the story at all...and in my opinion detracted from the true nature of the book and the wonderful story I remember reading. It's just another case of too much superficiality...and blatant disregard for content.","A Wrinkle in Time",3133,2.6,0.1
"3134",0.5,"  Awful movie, sad too see such a good book trashed in this way.","A Wrinkle in Time",3134,2.6,2.1
"3135",0.5,"  Made an account just to say how terrible it actually was. No part of this movie resembled the book. Emotional scenes were fake and boring, the acting was miserable. Don't waste your good money on such an insult to a beautiful book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3135,2.6,2.1
"3136",0.5,"  Seriously, this movie almost made me puke. But I was a good dad and took one for the team","A Wrinkle in Time",3136,2.6,2.1
"3137",2,"  My 8 year old liked this movie. The rest of us did not. It is very Disney, by which I mean more Disney at their worst (their execrable TV shows) than Disney at their best. It is saccharin sweet, with no depth at all to make the saccharin tolerable. The studio has sacrificed story in favor of excessive and over-the-top special effects. It had its moments, but the adults in our party were disappointed at the oppurtunity to render a classic kids' sci fi well, and the decision to turn it into a schmalzy, special-effects, and terrible pre-teen music extravaganza.","A Wrinkle in Time",3137,2.6,0.6
"3138",0.5,"  Never read the book, so I'm not comparing. But I'll never see this movie again..","A Wrinkle in Time",3138,2.6,2.1
"3139",1,"  Bored out of my mine!!!!!!! Stupid director and stupid disney!!!!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3139,2.6,1.6
"3140",0.5,"  You know when your gut instinct tells you ..nope waste of money...like wrinkle in wallet..","A Wrinkle in Time",3140,2.6,2.1
"3141",3.5,"  Good movie, but I have some concerns about it. The costume for Mrs. Who was a bit overexaggerated because of the eyebrows. Also, the battle between possessed Charles Wallace and Meg could've been a bit longer. Still, the movie was exciting, but also mysterious...","A Wrinkle in Time",3141,2.6,-0.9
"3142",1.5,"  A dull, Disney-fied version of a book that should have been wonderful when put on the big screen. While there was certainly some good acting throughout, the romance sub-plot felt forced and turned the whole thing into a very traditional Disney film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3142,2.6,1.1
"3143",1,"  Thank you Disney for trashing one of my favorite childhood books. Anyone reading this, the books are amazing, but this movie was too bad for words. I hope Disney stops with this movie and doesn't try to make any of the sequels. I'm getting very tired of their directors inserting all their politically correct agenda into classic stories.","A Wrinkle in Time",3143,2.6,1.6
"3144",5,"  It was okay but book is the best but This one is kind of not that bad when this movie come out a blu ray and dvd l going to buy it??","A Wrinkle in Time",3144,2.6,-2.4
"3145",3,"  Some classic teen fantasy novels were never meant to be adapted. Better to get the book and share it when the time is right. Then find this retelling long after digesting the print version. You'll see why, and be glad of it. Or just tesser on your own! We all can, in a manner of speaking.","A Wrinkle in Time",3145,2.6,-0.4
"3146",2,"  two stars for the part of the story they got right: the tiny bit from the book, when the kids go to Camazotz to retrieve Professor Murray and ending with their return. About 20 authentic minutes. I was abnle to get past the obvious miscasting (the Murrays are all red-headed as detailed more in the ensuing books), but not the costuming mistakes (all of the Mrs' are very ragtag on Earth because they don't belong). My biggest disappoint was all of the added adventures, at the cost of the genuine ordeals already written; which are exciting enough for a film in my opinion. Another favorite book series ruined by its film. I really wish that filmamkers would actually read the book they are attempting to create on screen.","A Wrinkle in Time",3146,2.6,0.6
"3147",1,"  Disappointing. Poor movie making. I have a lot of grace for movies with a good message, but this was hard to watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3147,2.6,1.6
"3148",0.5,"  Total crap. I want my 2 hours back! Disney, you are slipping big time!!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3148,2.6,2.1
"3149",1,"  Oprah is fabulous in all her glory, and so is Storm Reid cast as Meg in all the horrible situations she's forced to endure, but the movie fails to convey a clear story, and completely misses a key part of the original story in its rush to get Meg and company home. Look no further than the Wizard of Oz as an example of great adaptation in the same vein as Wrinkle in Time. WoZ involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch. So, my thoughts: cut the special effects gimmicks, return to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.Good try, but really.....","A Wrinkle in Time",3149,2.6,1.6
"3150",1,"  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE","A Wrinkle in Time",3150,2.6,1.6
"3151",1,"  This should have been so good. Instead it felt like the editor was tasked to remove 30 minutes of plot, so closed their eyes and picked at random. Yet they left in the scene where Reese Witherspoon turns into a flying piece of kale. This unfortunately ends up being one beautifully costumed, well acted mess.","A Wrinkle in Time",3151,2.6,1.6
"3152",2.5,"  It was alright for adults, but children would probably enjoy it more.","A Wrinkle in Time",3152,2.6,0.1
"3153",0.5,"  Painful to watch, cliche' acting/lines, Everything is flat, the kind of mellow music that tires your mind throughout the movie","A Wrinkle in Time",3153,2.6,2.1
"3154",1,"  Another movie in which the best parts were shown in the previews. I came out wishing that I had not wasted the price of the ticket.","A Wrinkle in Time",3154,2.6,1.6
"3155",2.5,"  Solid performances and vivid imagery doesn't make up for this poor crafted adventure that leaves nothing but a facepalm.","A Wrinkle in Time",3155,2.6,0.1
"3156",0.5,"  This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Nothing in the movie is redeemable. The effects are good awful, the acting is atrocious, the music makes my ears bleed, and 99% of the movie is shot with these ugly downward facing shot that make an already ugly movie uglier than sin. Stay far away from this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3156,2.6,2.1
"3157",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time does contain some impressive visual, but storywise it is very incoherent. Sometimes it comes off as a string of unrelated scenes edited together. The acting is very bad, for the most part. Storm Reid actually does do a good job in her role. The characters aren't very well fleshed out. Calvin, in particular, just randomly appears and serves no further purpose to the film. He just tags along. The message was great, but I wish they took a more subtle approach. Instead, they beat you over the head with it. Ava DuVernay seemed to have good intentions her, you know what they say about good intentions. Unfortunately, this film does not deliver and is a huge misfire. Can't recommend anyone see this film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3157,2.6,0.6
"3158",5,"  This film is everything I had hoped an updated version of Wrinkle in Time would be. I'm only a little sad that Auntie Beast was cut out but I can live without her.","A Wrinkle in Time",3158,2.6,-2.4
"3159",1,"  What a waste of time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3159,2.6,1.6
"3160",0.5,"  It is a made for TV movie with a big budget","A Wrinkle in Time",3160,2.6,2.1
"3161",3,"  Visually stunning, but it felt like it was missing a crucial element in the development of the story and characters.","A Wrinkle in Time",3161,2.6,-0.4
"3162",4,"  Heartwarming. Great family movie with a good message about self-love that's important for girls. Some of the scenes felt a little clunky but Storm Reid gives a great performance. Oprah feels typecast as a towering wise figure and while I know this is an adaptation from a book, the dialogue and character development leaves much to be desired.","A Wrinkle in Time",3162,2.6,-1.4
"3163",2,"  There's no denying the importance that this movie may have for some audiences. The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.I walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.I've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.There are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.4.0/10","A Wrinkle in Time",3163,2.6,0.6
"3164",1.5,"  The only reason I'll give this film a star and half is because of its strong acting and amazing visuals. Other than that, this film was a major disappointment. Not only is it dull and empty, it completely takes away from the majesty that was Madeleine L'Engle's classic. From taking away religious/Christian references, to taking out some of our favorite characters, and most of all, Ava DuVernay's adaptation also hurts when she decided to take out one of the best lines in the book. Mrs. Who's advice to Meg before going on the journey. Not only did Ava ruin one of our favorite kid books, but she also destroyed all of our hopes for a great spring blockbuster. Congratulations Disney and Ava DuVernay, for messing up one of the greatest kid fantasies of all-time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3164,2.6,1.1
"3165",2,"  Not worth seeing! I had high hopes for this move, but ""A Wrinkle in Time"" was a big let down. The movie was confusing, disjointed, and filled with outlandish scenes that did not mesh well. My 15-year-old daughter had read the book and was excited to see this movie, but was unfortunately utterly disappointed with adaptation to the big screen. The cinematography and soundtrack were great; not much else was. I would give this movie 4 out of 10.","A Wrinkle in Time",3165,2.6,0.6
"3166",0.5,"  Storm Reid's performance is compared to Christian Slater's performance in ""Mobsters"", which means that this movie is yes, that this movie is as bad as the 1991 movie ""Mobsters"". I'm not even going to get into how bad Reese Witherspoon was in this film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3166,2.6,2.1
"3167",2.5,"  I see what their going for but none of it lands because of the overt CGI and the one note characters. Reece Witherspoon turns into a giant CGI flying lettuce leaf and thats the most character defining trait she has. Everything in the movie looks great but feels hollow because the emotional beats are to hammered in. This would have been a better animated movie, some of the dialogue and writing is very cringe worthy but might have been saved by animated characters. .","A Wrinkle in Time",3167,2.6,0.1
"3168",5,"  it is a movie for people that like the universe and the power universe","A Wrinkle in Time",3168,2.6,-2.4
"3169",3,"  the movie was great but it screwed the book over and was nothing like how great the book was.","A Wrinkle in Time",3169,2.6,-0.4
"3170",2,"  This movie was often visually interesting--but that's IT. The plot didn't really hang, and they worked way too hard for some overdone themes. I am as woo-woo as the next 45-yr-old liberal, but I COULD NOT STOP my eyes from rolling the last 20 minutes or so. LITERALLY COULD NOT STOP THEM, even when I noticed my my hormonally-wracked pubescent teen girl actually CRYING, so I honestly tried, out of respect for her. I gave it 2 stars because Oprah is an automatic half-star, the visuals were great, and, well, my daughter liked it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3170,2.6,0.6
"3171",0.5,"  Do yourself a favor and read the book. Disney really needs to get their stuff together. fIRST lAST jEDI, THEN bLACK pANTHER AND NOW THIS TRAIN WRECK. iTS LIKE dISNEY ISN'T EVEN TRYING ANYMORE. hALF A STAR BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T TRY AND TIE THE TESSERACT INTO THE MARVEL UNIVERSE SOMEHOW...so there's that.","A Wrinkle in Time",3171,2.6,2.1
"3172",5,"  Loved it, and we need more films like this that are empowering and hopeful. Go to the light!","A Wrinkle in Time",3172,2.6,-2.4
"3173",1,"  Horrible movie, just horrible save your money! I got up and left after 30 min.","A Wrinkle in Time",3173,2.6,1.6
"3174",3,"  The beginning kicks off and fly's into action! Then crashes to the ground half an hour later...","A Wrinkle in Time",3174,2.6,-0.4
"3175",4,"  I don't know why this movie is getting such low audience reviews. I found it to be charming and it stuck to the ideals of the book, even though it's not *exactly* replicating everything that's in the book. It's not too scary of a movie for elementary age students and is entertaining for adults as well. As an educator who loves this book and often reads it to my upper elementary students, I liked the movie a lot. Folks, get past the ""Hollywood names"" and focus on Meg and Charles Wallace and their story and fight against evil.","A Wrinkle in Time",3175,2.6,-1.4
"3176",1,"  Poor acting and dumb effects.","A Wrinkle in Time",3176,2.6,1.6
"3177",0.5,"  Inept and tone-deaf tinkering with a beloved story. Plenty of very talented actors misdirected through a mess of awkward transitions, poorly paced dialogue, improperly acted responses, and mis-cut scenes.","A Wrinkle in Time",3177,2.6,2.1
"3178",5,"  Powerful, beautiful journey of a young heroine. A refreshing alternative to the violent battle fare offered to kids. My 12 year old son and friends loved it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3178,2.6,-2.4
"3179",1.5,"  Visually stunning, but the story is so hacked from the book that it ends up making very little sense. Some characters seems to just be along for the ride because they've been stripped down so far while others have changed so much from the book that they end up seeming to contradict their own nature. One character cannot speak in her own words...right up until they couldn't find a quote that suited the situation, and she just starts speaking for herself.They would have been a lot better off not trying to purge all the Christian elements of the book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3179,2.6,1.1
"3180",1,"  If you need a good 2 hour nap this film is a good choice.","A Wrinkle in Time",3180,2.6,1.6
"3181",2,"  I liked the young actors and Reese. You could see where they spent $100 million on special effects. Mindy and Oprah's roles were less impressive. There was one scene where Oprah and others are offering ""gifts"". There was one scene where Oprah and others are offering ""gifts"". I fully expected to have Oprah's character to give a car to the young actress (and everyone in the scene). By the way, I had not read the book","A Wrinkle in Time",3181,2.6,0.6
"3182",1,"  One of my favorite childhood books turned into a glitzy, politically correct cartoon. Very sad.","A Wrinkle in Time",3182,2.6,1.6
"3183",0.5,"  A book that relies so heavily on the readers imagination is undoubtedly difficult to put to film. Many times people, when speaking of adaptations, claim that the source books are always better than the films. In this case it is very true. Wrinkle In Time must be translated through the minds eye, it is only in that field of view that it can be great.","A Wrinkle in Time",3183,2.6,2.1
"3184",1,"  More trash from disney... dont bother and stick with the classics.","A Wrinkle in Time",3184,2.6,1.6
"3185",0.5,"  A true Green screen extravaganza!If you like cgi, then you will LOVE this movie!","A Wrinkle in Time",3185,2.6,2.1
"3186",2,"  I found the drama to be over the top. The little boy becoming a monster personality was disturbing and horrible. The heady PROPHESYING was ridiculous. A boy gets dropped to his death basically and some flowers catch him at the last second......ok, that could have been cool except for the fact that it didn't scare him in the slightest when he basically thought he was going to become a human pizza. I was literally squirming in my seat bored and bothered. The graphics were cool for some of it. I liked the flying woman scenes. Too much anger for me though","A Wrinkle in Time",3186,2.6,0.6
"3187",2,"  Visually captivating but falls short in all other respects. Storyline was oddly dark for a Disney movie, definitely not one to bring younger children to. Pass on this movie, way too many other good movies worth seeing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3187,2.6,0.6
"3188",0.5,"  Slow to begin and the over far to quickly. Poorly paced, could of such a better movie. The young actors where good and have potential, kid who plays Michael Wallace is creepy and familiar","A Wrinkle in Time",3188,2.6,2.1
"3189",1,"  A cosmic turd thru time and space","A Wrinkle in Time",3189,2.6,1.6
"3190",0.5,"  Unfortunately Hollywood and Disney keep relying on hiring directors who love identity politics and keep pushing to influence the younger generation with these concepts. They destroyed Star Wars and I think before I ever go see a Disney film again I will wait until the audience reviews are in to make a decision on whether I should spend money on a ticket.","A Wrinkle in Time",3190,2.6,2.1
"3191",5,"  Awesome! I loved it. I saw it with my sister and my niece. They loved it too. We intend to see it again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3191,2.6,-2.4
"3192",5,"  I really enjoyed this movie, I really like the acting throughout the movie, for example when one of the misses was being sarcastic. That was funny.","A Wrinkle in Time",3192,2.6,-2.4
"3193",1,"  This movie is a total no-go. If you want to waste 2 hours of your time on this mess of a movie, go for it. Little to write about, simply dry performances and hard to follow twists.","A Wrinkle in Time",3193,2.6,1.6
"3194",0.5,"  I thought that A Wrinkle in Time was a total complete fail!!! They were missing the Meg's twin brothers. Just because the twins didn't have a important role doesn't mean not to add them in the movie. I wasn't really a fan of the makeup I think they weren't focused on the main reason of this story. I was really looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time?? Don't waste your precious time and money on this horrible movie. I rather watch Black Panther or stay at home and watch the wall than spend my money on this BAD! movie??The actors were good but the some of the special effects were unrealistic??","A Wrinkle in Time",3194,2.6,2.1
"3195",5,"  I love this movie. Is it corny at times? Yeah, sure. But it's a DISNEY movie FOR KIDS. The cast is wonderful. It was healing to see that many people of color and that many women on screen. Can't wait to go see it again. & again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3195,2.6,-2.4
"3196",2,"  Was kinda entertaining but there were just so many things thrown in there that left me confused. This movie would have been better served if it were much much longer. So many possibilities but it just felt rushed and disjointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3196,2.6,0.6
"3197",2,"  A great book turned into a mediocre movie. Sure, the visuals are excellent, but the plot falls flat on it's face for most of the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3197,2.6,0.6
"3198",5,"  Really liked, it was visually appealing and with an amazing story. I liked how the movie is about finding happiness and believing in yourself. I cried the whole movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3198,2.6,-2.4
"3199",2.5,"  Visually beautiful . Storm was a Gem, I had hopes that it would have done better. The Cast was amazing , and Disney has always stole my heart. I just couldn't seem to become that excited . It lost me a few times and even with such a cast, I couldn't rate this higher than I had hoped to..","A Wrinkle in Time",3199,2.6,0.1
"3200",2,"  While not unwatchable, ""A Wrinkle in Time"" fails to live up to the hype and high expectations set out for by flashy trailers and an all-star cast. Though visually stunning, it feels as if too much information is trying to be crowded into two hours, while upon conclusion, it also seems as if very little has happened at all. If you're a fan of the book or are looking for a feel-good action, sci-fi, and coming-of-age crossover, you may very well enjoy ""A Wrinkle in Time"". Personally, I found the corniness a little too much to handle and would not recommend seeing this film unless you're looking for something to fit exactly those criteria.","A Wrinkle in Time",3200,2.6,0.6

"3202",5,"  This movie was exactly what I wanted, a heartfelt, gorgeous movie filled with diversity.","A Wrinkle in Time",3202,2.6,-2.4
"3203",1,"  This movie was just plain awful. Crappy special effects, terrible acting, unrealistic dialogue, and a story that was predictably cliche to the extreme. It didn't help that it was also chock full of social justice themes and buzzwords to make it even more cringey. There was literally nothing redeeming about this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3203,2.6,1.6
"3204",2,"  It's a rather rudimentary adaption of a book that is anything but. While the film lacks the tone and messaging that makes the book unique. Rather than a whimsical sci-fi tale, they settle for a cliched fantasy retelling of the plot, and on a whole it feels rather uninspired, Perhaps there was too much focus on external circumstances of the film (the director/main actress/oprah) and less on the substance of the story. If a faithful adaption is what you were looking for, look elewhere. If another ""Find yourself"" fantasy family film is what you want, this sort of scratches that itch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3204,2.6,0.6
"3205",2,"  Truly terrible costumes, horrible acting except by the kids.","A Wrinkle in Time",3205,2.6,0.6
"3206",3,"  The best aspect of this film for me was the dynamic between the main girl and her father. I also enjoyed the relationship she had with her younger brother. this movie had some really heartfelt moments among the family and overall an intriguing plot. However the execution wasn't the greatest. there were times throughout the film where i felt lost and bored. This can be attributed to the pacing and filling in gaps. I also felt that Reece witherspoon (whom i am a fan of) and Mindy Kalling were over acting and it came off as corny and annoying at times. I do believe a lot of audience members and critics might be a little too harsh on this one as i did enjoy myself. But there was definitely something missing that stood out and kept me from giving this movie a better rating.","A Wrinkle in Time",3206,2.6,-0.4
"3207",1,"  As an adult viewer, it was boring and extremely confusing and many of the story lines did not connect. I think a lot of the visual affects were to cover a very flawed movie.. My grand daughter was afraid at times, amused at others and bored. I was deeply disappointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3207,2.6,1.6
"3208",0.5,"  HORRIBLE. Not at all like the book. The characters aren't even fully developed and there is no reason to care about them or their journey. If you've read the book, don't see it. If you have a child who wants to read the book, don't take them. Waste of money!","A Wrinkle in Time",3208,2.6,2.1

"3210",1,"  it wont let me give it a bad review","A Wrinkle in Time",3210,2.6,1.6
"3211",0.5,"  I cannot remember the last time I wanted to actually walk out on a movie at the theaters. The acting was terrible, some of the visual effects were lacking, and it was just lazy. The writing was plain and boring and the music used during the film hurt the movie instead of helped the experience. Save your money. Don't see this mistake by Disney. If Oprah can act better than the kids chosen, Mindy whatshername and Reese Witherspoon, you know it's not good. Chris Pine was good, but barely in this female-filled garbage.","A Wrinkle in Time",3211,2.6,2.1
"3212",1.5,"  Saw it on Fri.. really wanted to like it.. but the motivations of the characters vs their actions didn't flow.. I don't know how the book is.. but as the movie by itself.. it was was really poorly written.. with story and plot holes all over the place that just made me wish I hadn't taken my boys to it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3212,2.6,1.1
"3213",0.5,"  Worst Disney movie I has ever seen! I would say it's too dark for any children. The movie was hard to follow and understand. I would not recommend it at all!","A Wrinkle in Time",3213,2.6,2.1
"3214",0.5,"  Unfortunately, this movie is terrible. The script is weak, the acting is poor, and it is a otherwise a complete mess. It wants to be profound, but fails at every turn. It tries to throw in some pop culture references to seem hip, but they all fall completely flat. It tries to develop chemistry with the characters and to create emotional involvement, but comes nowhere close. Quite frankly, by today's standards, it isn't even that much to look at. I certainly wouldn't call it gorgeous. Aside from a few costumes, the aesthetics fail to deliver. In all, this is an extremely disappointing Disney effort. Tomorrow Land looks monumental in comparison to this misfire.","A Wrinkle in Time",3214,2.6,2.1
"3215",0.5,"  Just awful. I don't even know where to begin, so I won't. Hopefully, this will inspire the people who wasted their money watching this to go grab the novel and truly enjoy this classic story, which was just horrifically brought to film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3215,2.6,2.1
"3216",4.5,"  It was a great movie. I focus on its plus, there are bad parts, but it is amusing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3216,2.6,-1.9
"3217",2,"  The book was somewhat preachy. This heavy-handed movie takes great special effects and cute actors and has them dully learn preachy lessons even more than the book. Boring.I think the lesson I am supposed to learn is that by studying math I can find the frequency to wish myself to other planets and join the fight against the spreading evil darkness.","A Wrinkle in Time",3217,2.6,0.6
"3218",0.5,"  The movie is very unique, but those unique is the downfall of it fame. Wrinkle in time by its name is realy very catchy name and also made people wonder. But the reality is differ. Disney is known to create something wonder. But this one is not, more i can say its boring. Event though the movies cgi effect is realy a wonderful touch, the background of the movie itself is not that wonderful. More like simplify background because the budget went to the effect and their actress i think.","A Wrinkle in Time",3218,2.6,2.1

"3222",5,"  It is a children's movie. The Quantum Physics is mentioned and I hope adults will investigate some of the terms, like ""frequency"" that have lessons for adults. I enjoyed the quotes and theme of the show.","A Wrinkle in Time",3222,2.6,-2.4
"3223",1,"  Horrible. Feel ripped off. Was like watching a made for TV show. Kids were great actors tho.","A Wrinkle in Time",3223,2.6,1.6
"3224",1,"  Worst movie of 2018. Save your money. Stay home and stream something or cut your toenails. It would be much better than this movie, which is nothing but a sound stage and a bunch of crying actors hugging each other. They didn't even try to do the cherubim from the book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3224,2.6,1.6
"3225",0.5,"  I had no idea what I was getting into. I saw ""Disney"" and figured it was a safe bet to be a well put together and entertaining movie. Now I'm trying to figure out what was worse, the hurried clunky storyline that just felt like the director was checking off a to do list of scenes, the B flick level acting or cheesy makeup and effects. This may actually be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel like Disney owes us an apology for this monstrosity. Skip it and take the family out for a bunch of dental work or maybe spend 2 hours shopping in Walmart. These are more pleasant ideas than sitting through this ""film.""","A Wrinkle in Time",3225,2.6,2.1

"3240",2.5,"  A Wrinkle In TimeInitial Reaction: Time's really shows its age.Main Characters Meg Murphy, Calvin O'Keefe, Charles Wallace: Three kids played by Storm Reid, Levi Miller and Deric McCabePlot Summary It's been four years since Meg's father vanished, and she's not dealing with it very well. She's shut herself out from others and other kids and adults don't show her much sympathy. But soon three magical women show up and they tell Meg that her father discovered a new way to travel to places that are a long way away. However he gets stuck in that stuck in that distant place for the past four years.  Meg and her brother, Charles - along with a friend, Calvin, rush off to a strange and far away land to find and rescue him. On the first stop in their journey, the women tell our heroes about a creature called ""the It"" (note: not Pennywise). This dark mass of ... stuff threatens to turn humanity against itself using mind control and persuasion. But Meg isn't leaving without her father - even if she has to face her greatest fears and take on her biggest challenges.SCORINGMain Characters These three are okay. I like Meg a lot because she really has trouble keeping it together after daddy vanishes. But the other two felt really bland in comparison. I would've like a better explanation as to why Calvin comes along on this trip. SCORE: 6Supporting Cast The three magical ladies have some flair to them - but they're only good in short bits before they get annoying. Good thing they bow out of the film early and let the kids shine. SCORE: 8Plot This film would've been better without the action sequences - like the tornado scene or the beach scene. And some of the tests really don't make sense - like the taste the sandwiches test. SCORE: 3Originality This film has the making of an interesting twist on a sci-fi, psychological movie, but some parts just felt flat - like when Meg finds her father. SCORE: 5Violence Factor The last scene has Meg getting physically beat up by the It. It would've been better just to keep it all in her head. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film is supposed to talk about overcoming your fears - but the message just doesn't resonate because the tests they go through don't really test them very much. SCORE: 5Final Score (out of 60): 31 % Score: 51.67% The book's always better than the movie, but this one needed to spend less time with the visuals and more time developing the conflicts between the characters - and the It.","A Wrinkle in Time",3240,2.6,0.1
"3241",2,"  2 Star Review:Years after her father's disappearance, Meg Murray comes across three celestial beings, who have traveled the universe to help Meg, her brother and her classmate find her father. A Wrinkle in Time is definitely a sight to behold. Throughout the film, the audience is treated to a visual spectacle with panoramic grandeur. At times, the film shines through to deliver to us the message of accepting oneself regardless of what flaws we think we may have and using that power of self worth to overcome the obstacles in life. The film, however, ends up trying too hard to convey that message and it doesn't help having the 3 celestial beings dressed up the way they are with all that makeup which adds a layer of campiness to movie that otherwise wants to be taken seriously. The acting is distracting during certain key moments along with clunky dialogue. While the film is to be commended for aiming high with such a powerful theme, it doesn't nearly reach the heights it was aiming for.","A Wrinkle in Time",3241,2.6,0.6
"3242",5,"  Although very right-brained, and moving at is own leisurely pace, A Wrinkle in Time brings back a sense of childhood wonder I haven't had in years.

"3256",1.5,"  A Wrinkle In Time was an adventurous book. Of course, when they called the book unfilmable, they didn't lie. In fact, this movie was nothing other than a worthless cash grab. Though visually stunning, this movie has so many aspects that caused it to become one of the most mediocre movies that the mouse house has ever brought to theaters. Many important parts of the book were cut out in the final film, including my personal favorite character, Aunt Beast. The film also was very choppy, and left you to imagine what was actually happening a majority of the time. To be honest, most of the movie was made of emotional moments. This took away from the whole adventerous spirit A Wrinkle In Time was supposed to have. And as a plus, most of the acting towards the end was so shameless that it felt as if the actors were mad that they participated in this mess themselves! I'm ashamed that I was excited to see this movie, to the point that the whole time I was sitting there watching it, I wish I could wish I could wrinkle it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3256,2.6,1.1
"3257",0.5,"  Waste of time.... worst movie I have ever seen","A Wrinkle in Time",3257,2.6,2.1
"3258",5,"  Such a beautiful movie that only adds to the book. The central message of love and facing what makes you afraid will resonate with both children and adults.","A Wrinkle in Time",3258,2.6,-2.4
"3259",3.5,"  Not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this movie! I am glad I don't pay attention to ratings. The movie had a great message, kids and adults alike should be able to relate and find things to love about this movie. Pass on the reviews and decide for yourself.","A Wrinkle in Time",3259,2.6,-0.9
"3260",2,"  Though beautifully costumed, and with gorgeous ""set"" design, unfortunately it does not serve to tell this epic story above the level of dull. Plot and action are mostly skimmed over for dialogue a child could have written, and an excess of examining the feelings and emotions of the main character that are fully understood within the first 10 minutes. Disappointing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3260,2.6,0.6
"3261",4,"  Glad I did not read any of the bad comments before seeing this movie as it was better than what many are saying it is & has some very good teaching points which most likely just went way over these bad reviewers heads!","A Wrinkle in Time",3261,2.6,-1.4
"3262",3.5,"  A good movie. Beautiful. Sad. I liked it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3262,2.6,-0.9
"3263",4,"  Very masterfully created but some of the main characters became flat very quickly and that was a little hard to watch. I would like to point out that a female director was behind this and her vision and visual perspective can through onto the movie itself. It's essence was feminine, and I mean that in a good way. It is very refreshing. Another refreshing aspect of this film is that it's target audience is not towards little children, but not explicitly adult content and sex and whatnot. This movie is, in my opinion, quite a jewel with it's message and how it conveys it. The editing and direction is very unique for this day and age and I am glad to have been a part of this time in history.","A Wrinkle in Time",3263,2.6,-1.4
"3264",0.5,"  THE WORST FILM. I HAVE SEEN","A Wrinkle in Time",3264,2.6,2.1
"3265",3,"  The film falls short for adults who read the book in the 1970s or 1980s, but not for its updating of references (""Daaang. Tucker. American""), but for leaving out some of the complexities of the book's plot. The film does a good job in emphasizing family connections and love, and a decent job of making ""faults"" an acceptable aspect of one's self. For kids, it is visually appealing and has some thrill. All that said, something didn't quite come together...it sought to be visually stunning, but wasn't inspiring at the same time, which seems to miss the mark. No matter what, this is an incredible performance by Storm Reid! Reese was expectedly quirky and Oprah maternal/grandmaternal, if not only because she and Storm could--by appearances alone--well be related. Deric McCabe is endearing and believable as a precocious Charles Wallace. All in all, see it, but if will be a movie you see only once or twice. Better in the theater than at home.","A Wrinkle in Time",3265,2.6,-0.4
"3266",1,"  The best part is simply being at the theatre, smelling popcorn, and chilling for a few mins before the previews end. First time in a while I haven't minded taking a bathroom break during a show.. what is it with Hollywood these days?","A Wrinkle in Time",3266,2.6,1.6
"3267",0.5,"  What a visually gorgeous catastrophe of a film. I'm so disappointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3267,2.6,2.1
"3268",5,"  Loved the movie. Didn't understand that shock that it is a kid's book and therefore a kid's book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3268,2.6,-2.4
"3269",3.5,"  An okay movie in its own right. The acting was far and away its best quality, especially the child actors (whose roles were pretty difficult). The special effects were pretty but overused, and much of the original story was changed in order to show off more of the visual effects. That's the main problem--the story was altered so significantly that it's a poor adaptation, and the meaning of the story is changed, too. If you haven't read the book, the movie won't be a disappointment.","A Wrinkle in Time",3269,2.6,-0.9
"3270",2,"  The best part of thr movie is the graphics and that to a degree. Plot is weak, actions is almost non existant. Science fact are minicule. I waist my money in the movies on this. More desapointing that the last transformers. Dont see it. Rent it. Becouse movies like this is why people pirate the movies.","A Wrinkle in Time",3270,2.6,0.6
"3271",4,"  I have to give 'Wrinkle in Time' a B. I really enjoyed this movie! I thought it was cute and inspiring. The beginning was the movie was okay but once we got to meet Oprah's character, I think that's when the movie turned into a good direction. Oprah was the winner in this movie. The visuals were spectacular; from the costumes to the hair to the makeup to the beautiful images of flowers and greeny. It was just visually stunning. I liked the fact that this movie really focused on believing in yourself and being a warrior in your life. It's a message that everyone needs to hear nowadays. The only downsides to me was the beginning of the movie cause it was a tad slow and I did not like the little girl's brother. He was just way too annoying to me but overall, it was really good film.

"3276",4.5,"  I just saw it, and I loved it. There were a few minor flaws, but they rarely took away from the film. Overall, my favorite part was the cinematography. There were many beautiful shots during the film, and the landscape was absolutely wonderful. The CGI in this movie was absolutely amazing, and I'd recommend anyone to see it for these alone. The movie did have flaws, however, as many of the characters were given very minor roles in the movie. There was also an issue with Calvin's jacket, the garment disappearing and reappearing every so often. There also wasn't much leading up to the battle between the 'Big Bad' and Meg. Although the movie had its flaws, I would still consider it amazing. I just wish that they had gone into more of a backstory with Veronica and Calvin. 10/10 would see again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3276,2.6,-1.9

"3278",2,"  Okay, so this movie is a mess. Its visually stunning-sometimes- but it rushes through the story so fast you could not probably comprehend on what happened. Plus, the characters aren't given time to really develop and sometimes their changes are too sudden. And finally, in my opinion, it is waaaay to cheesy 9/10 times.","A Wrinkle in Time",3278,2.6,0.6

So much of the movie dedicated on the kin of demonic and negative focus geesch if this movie was made for kids made to give them nightmares.Did they make this film on a shoestrings glitter and pixie dust because maybe if they would have it could have made a much better film ...Disney you could have done much better. The film is a waste of money hence why ticket sales are dying because of lackluster films with better film projects coming from netflixs and streaming sources.","A Wrinkle in Time",3281,2.6,2.1

"3285",3,"  Enjoyed the movie but still left feeling somethings were missing , I answered. The Mrs. Costumes were over the top, but great CG effects. Sadly, these effects took over and the story itself was pared down, if not actually dumbed down like do much these days. Went home and rewatched the original 2003 movie and and it was soooo much better. Deeper and introspective but not more than most kids could understand. Yes this versions Charles Wallace was way cuter, in fact this movie was way prettier and glitzier than the first. Like so much in today's culture. All glitz and glamour and little to no substance. In 2003, there was plenty if substance. Three stars for an adorable Charles Wallace and pretty, colorful sets . But for substance and a story kids will grab onto, find the older version. Our kids are smart enough not to need a colorful piece of fluff.","A Wrinkle in Time",3285,2.6,-0.4

"3288",2,"  Saw it, slept thru at least 20 minutes of it, Only reason to see it is to watch Chris Pine and Levi Miller, and Zach Galifianakis gave a good cameo.","A Wrinkle in Time",3288,2.6,0.6
"3289",2.5,"  15 years ago, when the original ""A Wrinkle in Time"" came out in 2003, the author, Madeleine L'Engle, knew that it was going to be bad before the negative reviews came out. Now with Ava DuVernay's adaptation of this ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" I seriously don't think that's going to change her mind about this, (if she was still here). The film is more underwhelming than 2012's ""John Carter"" and 2015's ""Tomorrowland,"" and the results are a weird mess. It's very easy to see that DuVernay did the best she can by bringing this classic novel to the big screen, but there are numerous of problems that are impossible to ignore.The film focuses on Meg Murry (Storm Reid), an outcast who lives with her mother, Dr. Kate Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who you may recognize her from the critical acclaimed episode of ""Black Mirror"" and most recently, ""The Cloverfield Paradox""), and her intelligent brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Four years ago, Meg and Charles Wallace's father, Dr. Alex Murry, (Chris Pine) has disappeared without a trace, and Meg's been feeling nothing but pain, sadness, and doubt after that. Later, she, Charles Wallace, and their friend, Calvin O' Keefe (Levi Miller), encounters three mysterious travelers, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and lastly Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and together they travel through different planets and universes to find their father.Let me just break down the problems with the film. The first problem is the soundtrack. I have admit to myself that I really like ""Pete's Dragon"" for its performances and the heart of the film, but if there's one complaint I have with the film, it's the soundtrack. I thought some of the songs don't seem to click in the film, and even I said the same with ""Suicide Squad,"" which its soundtrack was one of the real reasons why I hated the film. The soundtrack in ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" (which features new songs by Sade, Demi Lovato, and more), is nothing to be impressed. I'm not saying that the songs are bad, but they don't seem to work with the film.The second problem is the special effects. While some of the settings look pretty colorful to look at, the CGI effects, for the most part, looks unimpressive. The first time you see Oprah Winfrey as a 30-foot tall woman is really strange, (which I will explain more about the performances later). Then, there's a particular moment where we see our main characters have landed themselves on a planet, and we see flowers flying around; it reminded me of something in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" (which I'm not a huge fan of that movie). Next, you see Reese Witherspoon transforming herself into a flying creature, and it's, once again, very strange to look at it. I would say there were a couple cool moments when it came down to the special effects, (which both of them happened near the end of the film), though.The third problem is the way how they developed these characters. I thought the introduction of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which felt silly to me. Back to what I was saying about Oprah Winfrey, I find myself uncomfortable when I see her as a giant in this film, (although she wasn't always like that in the entire film). I'm not saying it's a bad performance by her, but it's definitely not her best one in my opinion, (even though I do like her in general). As with Meg and her family, they're actually quite possibly the best part of the film. The interaction between Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as husband and wife is nice, and so does the interaction between him and Storm Reid as father and daughter. It's just a shame that the film doesn't offer more insights on these characters.Storm Reid is terrific as Meg. She delivers every soul and energy in her character, and the way she performed onscreen is mind-blowing. I seriously cannot wait to see more films that have her in it. Some people, (such as Chris Stuckmann), have criticized Deric McCabe's performance as Charles Wallace, but for me I thought he was okay. I mean, watching him (spoiled alert) playing the dark side of his character, (which it happens near the end of the film), isn't perfect, but I do think he's got talent nevertheless. Levi Miller (""Better Watch Out"" and ""Jasper Jones"") does his best, but the film doesn't give him that much to do when he was playing the role of Calvin.I would have had a better experience with ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" if the story and characters were properly done. Or maybe if I didn't read the novel, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I do think director Ava DuVernay is a wonderful filmmaker, and I like what she has to say in all of her movies, but I think I prefer if she keeps making more movies like ""Selma."" There are so many things I can't ignore in this film. The story is messy, the pacing is inconsistent, the editing is choppy, the writing is flawed and uneven, and the execution, (especially when it pulls out its message about love), feels flat and unconvincing. My full opinion: 5.1/10.","A Wrinkle in Time",3289,2.6,0.1
"3290",2.5,"  I hate to diss on one of the greatest movie production companies of all time,but this review deserves what it is about to get. As Charles Wallace from thefilm adaption would say, this movie is very much so not good whatsoever. The three main characters (Meg, C.W and Calvin) were underdeveloped andmisused to make for a jumbled messy story that makes a little sense after.Chris Pine did nothing to add to this film, and there was too much giant Oprah Winfrey in the sky. I would stick away from this one until it either popsup on Netflix like a lot of other Disney movies, or just forget about it altogether.","A Wrinkle in Time",3290,2.6,0.1
"3291",0.5,"  I was expecting science fiction and got a sugary mess of whimsy and love-conquers-all rainbows wrapped in the thinnest layer of science fiction terminology. skip it and break your foot with a hammer instead. it will be more fulfilling.","A Wrinkle in Time",3291,2.6,2.1
"3292",5,"  I liked the movie very muchI think the story is good and all the actors are wonderful in terms of acting and formI loved this film and also was concerned about it because of the wonderful actors in the film","A Wrinkle in Time",3292,2.6,-2.4
"3293",0.5,"  Watched A Wrinkle In Time today. It was literally the dumbest, most infuriating movie I have seen in my life up to this point. I was expecting science fiction and I got a cut-rate childrens movie that was mostly rainbows and childish whimsy wrapped in a tissue-paper thin layer of sci fi terminology. There is not a single character that I did not hate within five minutes of their introduction. I laughed at the big villain moment because I am not intimidated by five year olds. Itd a movie that attempts to be inspiring and insightful when it has nothing more to say than 'The hippies were right, love solves all the worlds problems'. I can't recommend it on the visuals because the only good visual effects scene was at the end of the movie and the rest of them look like they were done by interns. I can't recommend this movie to parents because the moral of the story - if you can call it that - is that if you just love hard enough, Daddy will come back and the bullies at school will be nice to you.For the love of God, capital G divine one-and-only God, do not take a child to see this mpvie. No child deserves to have this inflicted on them. No child needs even the barest hint of the thought that they can make Daddy come back or make solve other complex real-world issues just by loving at it hard enough, because if yiu convince a kid that and loving at it doesn't work, wellI guess that means you didn't love Daddy enough/I guess you're just not loving enough to be treated with basic human respect.I have a habit of being hyperbolic and exaggerating to make things more amusing but here, now, for thebfirst time in my life I am genuinely just this pissed off at something. I haven't been angry like this since I was in fucking elementary school. Fuck this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3293,2.6,2.1
"3294",3,"  I was so excited to see this movie and almost fell asleep. I was so sad about this reaction. Visually, it was lovely, though.","A Wrinkle in Time",3294,2.6,-0.4
"3295",3,"  I love all things sci fi and was eager to see this movie. I enjoyed it overall, but was disappointed with various elements. #1 the treatment of Calvin. I kept asking. what about Calvin? And Oprah's costumes were awful. Totally distracting to me. Kids will probably like it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3295,2.6,-0.4
"3296",4.5,"  This movie is perfect for older kids. It is full of wonder and curiosity. The ways it diverged from the book were well done and I was pleased with many of the changes. It is inspiring and thought provoking. Saw it in 3D which was well worth it ??.","A Wrinkle in Time",3296,2.6,-1.9
"3297",5,"  I can't believe all the negative reviews! This is a disney movie based on a young adult novel. If you've read the book, this is fun to see. They left out some scenes I would have loved to see included in the film, but that's how any book adaptation goes. This movie is visually stunning and it's not perfect, but for goodness sake it deserves a better rating than it currently has. Down with the haters.","A Wrinkle in Time",3297,2.6,-2.4
"3298",5,"  awesome concepts to life in message","A Wrinkle in Time",3298,2.6,-2.4
"3299",0.5,"  ""A Wrinkle In Time"" was a classic book, beloved by a generation. Oprah and her coven of PC fellow-travelers have forever ruined this classic with their inability to entertain instead of delivering a leftist sermon. A flop. A pile of crap.","A Wrinkle in Time",3299,2.6,2.1
"3300",2,"  two points just for the special effects... all the plots are just throwing at you, audience feels no emotional connection with the movie. Also, lots of meaningless close-up shots.","A Wrinkle in Time",3300,2.6,0.6
"3301",1,"  I remember reading this book as a kid and wanting to get to the end so bad to see how it ended. That is the only similarity I found with this movie. It was so bad, i could hardly wait until it ended.","A Wrinkle in Time",3301,2.6,1.6
"3302",0.5,"  I haven't read the book, but judging by other reviews i can agree that this movie fails ti deliver. Lots of cringy and confusing moments, horrible antagonist, and boring characters that could've have more background told but in the end just they just left bland. Only good thing about this movie is it's gorgeous visual, yet bad camera angle and strange close up moments ruined it for me. For a Disney movie, its very disappointing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3302,2.6,2.1
"3303",5,"  This movie is awesome watch it at first you just think umm what is happening but then wow","A Wrinkle in Time",3303,2.6,-2.4
"3304",5,"  Beautiful and inspiring movie - I loved this take. I'm not surprised that most critics are white folks and men. It was odd to be the only one who chuckled at the Outcast quote in the totally full theatre - until I realized it was 99% white folks and in a rich neighborhood. Thank you for this excellent movie, Ava Duvernay and crew, and if some folks don't like it, well, too bad for them. My daughter and I loved it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3304,2.6,-2.4
"3305",0.5,"  It has some interesting moments...but a lot of the movie is very scientific and it never really introduces a plot besides the fact that Meg is looking for her missing father...and then the plot twist in a very scary way that I wouldn't want a child to see it's just very nerve wracking and I double checked the rating twice while I was in the movie! My rating is very low, but I did love the three Misses they were very unique and interesting!","A Wrinkle in Time",3305,2.6,2.1
"3306",1.5,"  I tried posting a review of this when it came out but it would not post, I posted a review of another movie no problem, what gives are you trying to protect this movie from its inevitable bad reviews?They cut the relevance out of this book to movie adaptation and ruined it in the process, it was also very boring there was a whole section of things that the cinematographer must have thought looked cool, it served no purpose in the film","A Wrinkle in Time",3306,2.6,1.1
"3307",0.5,"  This movie was awful.....","A Wrinkle in Time",3307,2.6,2.1
"3308",0.5,"  The low-budget 70's sci-fi look to the costumes was not nearly as distracting as the acting and after-school-special quality.","A Wrinkle in Time",3308,2.6,2.1
"3309",2,"  Oprah is fabulous in all her glory, and so is Storm Reid cast as Meg in all the horrible situations she's forced to endure....and Charles Wallis not bad either. But you can't make up for the fundamental flaws. The movie fails to convey a clear story, and completely misses a key part of the original story in its rush to get Meg and company home. An example of how this movie could have been made? Look no further than the Wizard of Oz which is an adaptation of a book, involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch.Cut the gimmicks, and back to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.Good try, but really....","A Wrinkle in Time",3309,2.6,0.6
"3310",4,"  Excellent movie Well done","A Wrinkle in Time",3310,2.6,-1.4
"3311",0.5,"  Not what it was hyped up to be, bad camera angles. Odd visuals, needed a new directions. Do not waste your time, go see black panther again instead of this. Mad love to the actors but no, just no","A Wrinkle in Time",3311,2.6,2.1
"3312",4,"  LOVED THIS MOVIE! Confused as to why people say it isn't like the book. I just read the book and it's very similar - even better than what my imagination could conjure up. Oprah is a goddess in this movie. The entire premise is so incredibly important. I plan on going to see it again!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3312,2.6,-1.4
"3313",3.5,"  Loved the book(s), really enjoyed the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3313,2.6,-0.9
"3314",1,"  By removing key items from the book's story (not the least of which being all references to Christianity) not only did it lose reason, it also lost a good portion of the book's fan base.","A Wrinkle in Time",3314,2.6,1.6
"3315",1,"  This film is a nightmare with terrible plot and poor acting from the female lead. If it wasnt Levi Miller, I had given it 0 star, Levi acting and character is the only reason i even bothered to give this trash 1 star. Seems like Disney has invested all their time and good team to Black Panther and other Marvel movies. They didnt have time to make an other proper movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3315,2.6,1.6
"3316",0.5,"  Horrible waste of movie making would be too kind. Sorry Ava! The script was lackluster, acting sub par and overall boring.","A Wrinkle in Time",3316,2.6,2.1
"3317",2,"  A Wrinkle In Time is, unfortunately, my least favorite Disney movie so far. It's clear that the director had big ambitions to be visually dazzling, emotional, and wildly entertaining and for most of the movie, it fails to be any or all of those things.","A Wrinkle in Time",3317,2.6,0.6
"3318",2,"  Could not imagine how Disney screw up such a concept full of potentials. I watched the trailer and thought it was fascinating, so I went to see it despite the reviews. Yep, it is that bad.","A Wrinkle in Time",3318,2.6,0.6
"3319",0.5,"  This was absolutely a waste of time. This movie jumped around so much that it has to be one of the most difficult movies to follow for anyone who has ever had the pleasure of reading the book. CGI alone will drive you mental. The camera angles screw up your eyes, I don't recommend sitting anywhere but the back row this movie or you will get sick. You must have to really enjoyed the book to fork over the cash to see this. If you want to have a fun drinking game, drink every time someone says the word universe, father or CharlesWallace. Seriously Charles Wallace as in one name the movie waste about 20 minutes of our time with that name alone. Charles Wallace come here, CharlesWallace I love you, CharlesWallace don't do that, CharlesWallace CharlesWallace CharlesWallace CharlesWallace. If you seen the trailer to this movie, you've seen the movie. There is not much else going on. One of the biggest problems is the ending by which it takes 10 minutes to wrap everything up standing in the kitchen. Extremely boring movie. Read the book you'll get more out of it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3319,2.6,2.1
"3320",1,"  Went into this pretty excited. I was actually keen to watch it, until about halfway through once the acting started on a downwards slope with a plot that felt empty, an antagonist that felt like it was on screen for about 5 minutes and a giant sentient lettuce head that appeared once and was never seen again. The best part of this movie was before ""Tessering"" came into play. Also the ""Shut up Meg"" line that felt like it was straight from family guy.","A Wrinkle in Time",3320,2.6,1.6
"3321",4,"  Great visuals and good messages espoused for adults but especially for kids. Yay for positive films!!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3321,2.6,-1.4
"3322",2.5,"  I went to see this movie with my Mother because she remembers reading the book when she was quite young. She is legally blind in one eye, so we couldn't see the film in 3D. I think the film may have been relying a little too much on the 3D element, because I did not feel like it was anything special. I am glad to see such strong females leads and look forward to seeing Storm Reid in more films to come, however, I would not want to see this film again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3322,2.6,0.1
"3323",0.5,"  This movie seemed way too rushed, and just had no explanations for anything.","A Wrinkle in Time",3323,2.6,2.1
"3324",1,"  It felt like we sat in the seats for four hours. That's not good. The acting was horrid, the themes overplayed. Oprah was horrible. Mindy Kalings winking after every quote was super cringe inducing. The character Meg was just...so bland. The screenwriting was atrocious. Please don't waste your money or your time, even when it comes to iTunes. It is that bad.","A Wrinkle in Time",3324,2.6,1.6
"3325",1,"  This was a slow , confusing and boring movie. Definitely not a small Childs movie. The acting was stilted and characters were silly. They never did explain how the father and male friend returned and the ""It"" was unbelievable. This was the worst Disney movie I have ever seen.!!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3325,2.6,1.6
"3326",1.5,"  Very sad to have to say this movie was underwhelming, Sorry Oprah and Ava I really wanted to love it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3326,2.6,1.1
"3327",3.5,"  Do not listen to the critics. This was a good movie. Beautiful and wonderous and the cast was excellent. Special kudos to its young star Storm Reid, who brought a tear to my eye. Yes it is a childrens film so bring that child like wonder when you see it. Yes there were also some holes and did not follow the book exactly but that is to be expected in a movie interpretation. I hope to see more movies like this with girl leads in the future and I want to see more from DuVernay.","A Wrinkle in Time",3327,2.6,-0.9
"3328",4,"  this is sweet movie that have you rooting for the girl","A Wrinkle in Time",3328,2.6,-1.4
"3329",1,"  Terrible movie that tries too hard to be this empowering movie with bad CGI.","A Wrinkle in Time",3329,2.6,1.6
"3330",2.5,"  The costumes were excellent, and the messages were good. However, the movie dragged in spots and was difficult to follow. I took my 12 y/o and 15 y/I granddaughters and they both enjoyed it but expressed that it was disjointed in spots and hard to follow. Not for young children.","A Wrinkle in Time",3330,2.6,0.1
"3331",1.5,"  In this baffling narrative feature follow-up to her 2014 hit ""Selma,"" director Ava DuVernay trades socially resonant thematics and solid performances for what's basically a couple hours of infuriating logic vomit. Both movies do have Oprah in them, though, that's for sure. It's honestly been a long time since I've seen such an immeasurably dumb, narratively tone-deaf movie backed by a studio with such confidence. There's such an impossibly small amount of sense in this story that it's actually hard for me to believe some sort of snafu didn't happen between the Disney executives and the creative minds at hand. This might just be 2018's living embodiment of ""biting off more than one can chew."" So many ideas, yet no consistency or care to explain any of it. Yeesh.","A Wrinkle in Time",3331,2.6,1.1
"3332",1,"  this movie was so boring. Disney must have been hard up for cash so they chose some nobody as a director because it was very very poorly directed. My daughter wanted to see this movie so I took her to see it and after a half hour she was texting on her phone. We saw 6 or 7 people walking out and we did the same. just because it has good special effects does not make up for the good awful direction this movie had. The director should never ever have another job as an director again.! worst director ever, the book was 1 million times better than this move.","A Wrinkle in Time",3332,2.6,1.6
"3333",0.5,"  worst movie of the year","A Wrinkle in Time",3333,2.6,2.1
"3334",1,"  Very disappointed in a weak, pathetic adaptation of an excellent book. ThE NEW AGE QUACKERY AND POORLY WRITTEN SCRIPT, NOT TO MENTION THE MEDIOCRE ACTING MADE THIS A BORE TO WATCH.","A Wrinkle in Time",3334,2.6,1.6

"3336",0.5,"  Disapointing, director sub-par.","A Wrinkle in Time",3336,2.6,2.1
"3337",2,"  This film was a pretty big disappointment. Right off the bat, the audio is not mixed well. I was trying my hardest to listen to the dialogue but there was blaring music in the background. Next, the story was just not up to snuff. Endless plot holes and overall unbelievable performances across the board. Mindy's character had no depth. Charles Wallace was unbearable. He had a line or two that made me chuckle but on the whole, he was very obnoxious -- perhaps intentionally, but it made me dislike anytime he was on the screen. Some people hated the visuals but I actually thought they were some of the better parts of the film. It's world-building outside of the Earthling reality and it was cool to see this imaginative world. If only the story came together in a coherent, organized way with a believable script. Recommend others watch this when it hits Netflix.","A Wrinkle in Time",3337,2.6,0.6
"3338",0.5,"  Absolutely the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to sit through nothing like the book the first hour seems like it took four days to pass absolutely worst direction of any movie ever made I'm Serious it made the worst movie ever seem like an Oscar movie stay away at all cost","A Wrinkle in Time",3338,2.6,2.1

"3341",0.5,"  I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE, BUT FOR ME IT WAS A FAIL. TO MANY CHARACTER CHANGES, OR ALTOGETHER OMMISSIONS.

ALSO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE LESS CUT OUT OF AN ALREADY THIN NOVEL.","A Wrinkle in Time",3341,2.6,2.1
"3342",0.5,"  This movie is so bad I do not have the words to adequately express my disappointment. I am uninterested in commentary that 'the book is the book and the film is the film'. In fact, that is the kind of group think trope that the book rails against. it was clear this movie was more about Hollywood's agenda than accurately representing the story written. by Ms. L'Engle. My position is that if you don't want to do the book on film, but want to use the characters, fine. buy the rights to the characters, write your own story and make a movie. DO NOT name the movie the book. of course, it would rob you of the opportunity to entice lovers of the book into your theaters, but it is the more honest approach.","A Wrinkle in Time",3342,2.6,2.1
"3343",1,"  Worst remake ever. I don't think the director even read the original book or movie. Everything was so so bad. I have been waiting for the remake since I saw the poster last year and I was so excited for mindy and Oprah but holy crap. The angels sucked (image staring up someone's nose) and there is ZERO magic. Ms whatsit (Reese Witherspoon ) was a snotty bitch. She was nowhere near a mystical timeless being.","A Wrinkle in Time",3343,2.6,1.6
"3344",3.5,"  This movie is actually a fun adaptation of the books and has a lot more heart than many other recent family movies.It is a shame that places like rotten tomato have become the platform of group trying to sway their agenda on everyone by downgrading movies just because it doesn't fit their needs or believes.People don't be influenced by this, watch a movie and make your own decision and enjoy them for yourself.And for those that are downgrading movies because of racial hate or because it doesn't fit you right religious agenda sorry to say but need to get a life","A Wrinkle in Time",3344,2.6,-0.9
"3345",0.5,"  It should be titled ""A Waste of Time"". Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Every aspect of this film was poorly done. It's a shame really. There was potential to create something amazing. Should have hired a director that is worth a damn.","A Wrinkle in Time",3345,2.6,2.1
"3346",0.5,"  Nothing like the original book. Apparently the Christian references were not sufficiently inclusive. Oh by the way, I am neither male nor white and I still didn't like the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3346,2.6,2.1
"3347",5,"  I have some reviews and my point of view is what reviews are considering to be ""faults"" I believe are the strength of the movie. I believe this to be one of those novels that is extremely hard to adapt into a movie, but I think they took the essence of the book a produced a wonderful movie. So Wrinkle in Time I gift you your faults.","A Wrinkle in Time",3347,2.6,-2.4
"3348",1.5,"  Looks and sounds like a boring movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3348,2.6,1.1
"3349",1,"  Yuck! The story was completely changed. Key parts that contributed to beautiful lessons and character development were eliminated. Random scenes were added in that took away from the experience. #Butchered","A Wrinkle in Time",3349,2.6,1.6
"3350",0.5,"  Disgustingly cliche while being of low quality with many plot holes, which is a bloody shame since I was looking forward to this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3350,2.6,2.1
"3351",0.5,"  In no way measured up to the beautiful L'Engle book. The main character was stiff and boring. The screenplay eliminated the most salient elements of the story. What remained was trite and empty of the profound message that makes this children's book a true classic.","A Wrinkle in Time",3351,2.6,2.1
"3352",1,"  waste of time. no redeemable qualities.","A Wrinkle in Time",3352,2.6,1.6
"3353",3,"  While clearly aimed primarily at children and with numerous faults, Wrinkle in Time is still a beautiful film both visually and emotionally. Being a father who has at times been lost myself I was able to identify with the narrative despite it being clumsily delivered.","A Wrinkle in Time",3353,2.6,-0.4
"3354",0.5,"  What did I just watch? I want my money back.","A Wrinkle in Time",3354,2.6,2.1
"3355",2,"  A lifeless collection of characters makes this seem about 5 hours long. I think that there are a ton of missed opportunities here. I had hoped for better from DuVernay.","A Wrinkle in Time",3355,2.6,0.6
"3356",0.5,"  As a moviegoer, I am not hard please. However, I haaaaated this movie, as did my mom, brother, and husband who were with me. It was incredibly boring, and the story made little sense. I also found pretty much all of the dialogue to be absolute garbage. It was like the writers did some mad libs, and just filled in every blank with ""The Universe"" or ""Love."" I could not roll my eyes hard enough for this movie. I did give it a half star because I liked some of the visuals.","A Wrinkle in Time",3356,2.6,2.1
"3357",5,"  I thought this movie was amazing. I cried through the whole movie. Maybe you have to be, or have been, a sad 12 year old girl to appreciate this movie. Having been that girl, this movie hit me in the GUT. I thought it was beautiful and uplifting and meaningful. I don't really understand why this movie is getting so much flack. Can't a movie just sometimes be lovely and fun and joyful? 5 out of 5 stars from me though!","A Wrinkle in Time",3357,2.6,-2.4
"3358",1,"  The only magic in this movie is the sheer desperation in publishing it regardless of the many many cliches in this movie that people had seen dozens of times throughout film histories. No originality here.","A Wrinkle in Time",3358,2.6,1.6
"3359",0.5,"  probably the worst disney movie ever!","A Wrinkle in Time",3359,2.6,2.1
"3360",0.5,"  the movie, ""A Wrinkle In Time"", was to me, and very disappointing one. Starring Storm Reid as Meg Murry and Levi Miller as Calvin O'Keffe, I found myself in a tornado of dispointment and grief. That is metaphorical because I referenced to the tornado of bad-ness (which i found politically incorrect due to the ebony color). I found this movie vitriol to the soul, leading me to suicidal and self-harming thoughts. These emotions were brought up by the fact that the main characters did not smack lips. The result of missing the interlocked lips, i concluded a lower rating i would perceive that this movie is deserving of.I am in deep aungish and am in search of a mental hospital or family theripist close to the area around the tesserae due to the deep wounds cut in my flesh from the film. The promised lip - intertwinement i deserved was never offered or given. For the following reasons, i come to the conclusion of a half star rating on the film ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and i caution you to watch at your own risk.Consider what has been said,Edwarda P.

"3361",0.5,"  Absolute terrible movie","A Wrinkle in Time",3361,2.6,2.1
"3362",1,"  It's scarce bit of charm isn't enough to have you overlook its lazy narrative agenda, lackluster visuals, and outright boring plot. Big disappointment considering its source material.","A Wrinkle in Time",3362,2.6,1.6
"3363",3,"  An adventure that spans from the imagination to the ends of the universe with a message of positivity that slightly obscures the point of the original children's classic.","A Wrinkle in Time",3363,2.6,-0.4
"3364",0.5,"  i made a rotten tomatoes account just to give this a 0.5 star rating. grossly underwhelming and immensely disappointing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3364,2.6,2.1
"3365",2,"  I did not enjoy this movie. The acting was not good and it did not keep me intertained. The end of the movie could not come fast enough.","A Wrinkle in Time",3365,2.6,0.6
"3366",5,"  I really can't understand the whole rush of negative feedback this movie has received. It's a movie targeted at children, supported by a cast of tremendously talented women. It's moving and magnificent.","A Wrinkle in Time",3366,2.6,-2.4
"3367",0.5,"  The book was better , the movie cut out so much..","A Wrinkle in Time",3367,2.6,2.1
"3368",1,"  Must have a real story, cannot just check off items on your PC checklist. That might make a director feel good about how "" important"" the movie is, but it won't sell tickets. Ready Player One will wipe this mess off the map.","A Wrinkle in Time",3368,2.6,1.6
"3369",5,"  i loved this movie VERY much it was amazing","A Wrinkle in Time",3369,2.6,-2.4
"3370",4,"  Ignore the critics and Super Reviewers and go to a movie to have fun. It's a great movie, especially for young girls. To all the adult males reviewing it..why? We don't want to hear your opinion on something you can't appreciate!","A Wrinkle in Time",3370,2.6,-1.4
"3371",0.5,"  This was pathetically casted and overall bad storytelling. This was a CGI pukefest and I want my money","A Wrinkle in Time",3371,2.6,2.1
"3372",2,"  Hubby and I saw this on the first day. I had no idea about the plot of this other than I have read other books about Meg. Aside from the elaborate costumes and special effects, there were plot holes. Special effects were WAY overdone and at times, hubby and I were wondering what about the people that you just left?","A Wrinkle in Time",3372,2.6,0.6
"3373",5,"  This is an excellent add up Tatian to one of my favorite childhood books. My 17-year-old daughter who is currently studying physics, where's glasses, and has hair like me, fell into my arms and wet she said, ""mom I felt seen"" my nine-year-old daughter ripped off for 3-D glasses when it was over and yelled that is the best thing I've ever seen in my life!. My friends kept trying toMy sons kept trying to decide which one of them was Charles Murray. Bravo Ava and all of the cast and crew!","A Wrinkle in Time",3373,2.6,-2.4
"3374",0.5,"  the kind of crap you'd expect from Oprah.","A Wrinkle in Time",3374,2.6,2.1
"3375",2.5,"  I saw it and don't need my money back or anything, but I don't see watching it again anytime soon. Multiple obstacles are rushed through so there's no barely any tension, especially what I see as the best scene in the movie that's largely shown in the trailer. Children are creepily bouncing balls in unison and for a moment the movie becomes more interesting, however the length of the scene in the actual movie is barely extended from what is shown in the trailer. Multiple times, the tension dissipates as fast as it appears.Far from the worst movie I've seen, but could have been much better.","A Wrinkle in Time",3375,2.6,0.1
"3376",1,"  saw this with my wife.. OMG.. so hard to follow, sloppy editing and the acting was soso. Would not see this again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3376,2.6,1.6
"3377",1,"  I was excited about this movie but was really disappointed. It was really boring and I had trouble even staying awake. I want my money back!","A Wrinkle in Time",3377,2.6,1.6
"3378",1,"  It's discouraging that's not very good, given what an evident, palpable desire project this is.","A Wrinkle in Time",3378,2.6,1.6
"3379",1,"  This movie should have a different title, it's absolutely NOTHING like the book. Rotting garbage is accurate","A Wrinkle in Time",3379,2.6,1.6
"3380",0.5,"  So completely divested from the book that the only true ement it shares is the title. Simply, a bad movie done poorly.","A Wrinkle in Time",3380,2.6,2.1
"3381",1.5,"  Underwhelming. It had fun colors and big actors but it was really meh. The story was dull, boring, and SPOILER ALERT I hated that they turned the little boy into a villain. It has an empowering message but I was really disappointed with the execution of the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3381,2.6,1.1
"3382",0.5,"  What a confused mess of a film. This borders on an in name only adaptation so fans of the book will be pissed. I wish I could get the time I wasted on this back.","A Wrinkle in Time",3382,2.6,2.1
"3383",1,"  It didn't work. At all. My daughter was confused. I was disappointed. I expected some real feels in this movie. Instead I kept thinking: ""when is this going to end?"" Terrible. Flat acting. Story seemed compressed to death.","A Wrinkle in Time",3383,2.6,1.6
"3384",0.5,"  Sadly, another lost opportunity to bring a great story to life-a huge disappointment brought about by inept and tone-deaf tinkering with a beloved story. Plenty of very talented actors, well cast but misdirected through a mess of awkward transitions, poorly paced dialogue, improperly acted responses, and mis-cut scenes, all telling a jerry-rigged story that lacked the depth and power of the original book. It's hard to understand how the executives let this go to screen without serious repair.","A Wrinkle in Time",3384,2.6,2.1
"3385",0.5,"  I was so excited for this movie. But it was terrible. I fell asleep at the end. It was poorly acted. Poorly written. And the flow was just off from the beginning. Awful film. Only movie in the last 5-10 years that I wish I hadn't paid tonsee in the theatre.","A Wrinkle in Time",3385,2.6,2.1
"3386",5,"  I don't think I'm a completely unsophisticated filmgoer - fmy favourite film in the last couple of years is ""The Lure"", from Poland - does that help place me? But I loved this movie! I think DuVernay's directorial choices are daring, and I don't like all of them, but I was utterly charmed by most. This is a child's story, told to and for children. If you go, let your inner child watch it. I haven't read the book, but I went with my daughter (BA in Comparative Literature, Masters in Libarary Science) who read it when she was 11 or 12, and she helped keep my expectations for the story itself realistic (youngsters who read it are powerfully affected but often surprised by its flaws if they re-read it later in life). We were both delighted.","A Wrinkle in Time",3386,2.6,-2.4
"3387",1,"  This movie was very slow and boring.","A Wrinkle in Time",3387,2.6,1.6
"3388",0.5,"  For one of my favorite books as a child, this movie was absolute garbage. The acting was pretty much unwatchable. Pine and Mbatha-Raw were passable, though not stellar, but the three Mrs. were awful from start to finish. I don't know what the director was trying to accomplish, but I pray there are no sequels made. I'll just go back and enjoy the books.","A Wrinkle in Time",3388,2.6,2.1
"3389",1,"  Well, I read the books......this movie had nothing to do with them....totally changed it. Did not like it at all!","A Wrinkle in Time",3389,2.6,1.6
"3390",1,"  My 11-year-old daughter loved it, but even when I tried to watch through the eyes of a child, it just wasn't entertaining. I wanted to like it; I just didn't. I was bored to tears.","A Wrinkle in Time",3390,2.6,1.6
"3391",2.5,"  I had a hard time following this movie. The first hour is unbelievably slow. the whole movie is clunky and feels like each act was written by someone different. and does mrs. whatsit really turn into a giant lettuce leaf?! I haven't read the book, but I had to do some research and make sure that wasn't in the book. Thank God, it wasn't, which is why my kids enjoyed the book much more than the movie. The acting made this movie watchable, which is why I gave it an extra star than I would have. Chris Pine pulls off some a couple of good emotional scenes that had my wife tearing up. The visuals were also amazing, but good acting and beautiful imagery can't save this mess.","A Wrinkle in Time",3391,2.6,0.1
"3392",1.5,"  My kid fell asleep during this boring movie, I would recommend waiting for this movie to hit Netflix before watching.","A Wrinkle in Time",3392,2.6,1.1
"3393",0.5,"  I found this book when I was thirteen (a year after it was published)and loved it and the ones that followed. Disney, as is their talent, did a great job with costumes and special effects while distorting the storyline in significant ways. If I hadn't been with a group, I would have walked out. It's rewritten version has a good message for young girls about claiming their value and developing self-esteem. I just wish they'd made it a new movie with its own storyline created just for it and left WRINKLE IN TIME for some group like a combination of Peter Jackson (finally managed to do Lord of the Rings, also believed something that couldn't translate to film) and the Wachowskis (whose amazing body of work shows, I think, they could capture the essence of the special affects to support the story.)","A Wrinkle in Time",3393,2.6,2.1
"3394",0.5,"  A painful cure for insomnia.","A Wrinkle in Time",3394,2.6,2.1

"3398",1,"  the slow pace of the first hour plus the over directed and nice story line lost my interest.","A Wrinkle in Time",3398,2.6,1.6
"3399",0.5,"  Everything that was good and hopeful in the movie has been twisted. It's a blatant attempt to remove God as a basis for hope, comfort, and strength. It also just destroyed the original story, opting for glitz and glamour over gritty and real. It's pretty obvious that creativity is dead in Hollywood, which is why this shift to activism. People can't just make a good movie with a good story. There MUST be a message BEYOND that of the intent of the original. If this was an original story/screenplay and NOT based on a classic, it never would have been made by a mainstream studio.","A Wrinkle in Time",3399,2.6,2.1

"3405",2,"  Visually fun, message was a little too preachy.","A Wrinkle in Time",3405,2.6,0.6
"3406",3,"  Great visuals and a well defined cast of characters but the story and some importantdetails (such as a better defined plot) were left by the side of the road. I had to explain to my parents why certain scenes, though interesting to watch, actuallyPertained to a bigger picture and reveal important but poorly defined details.The moral messages pretty much slapped you in the face throughout the film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3406,2.6,-0.4
"3407",3.5,"  Ok movie, with wonderful actors and visuals, but the score was unmemorable, and the ending felt like the protagonist did nothing to overcome evil.","A Wrinkle in Time",3407,2.6,-0.9

"3410",2.5,"  A movie only good for 5-7 year olds anyone older will be bored out of their mind. Full of MEDIOCRE specal effects and AMATEUR acting, the scenes where either draged out with little to no SIGNIFICANTs or brushed over COMPLETELY. the movie either made no scense or it BASICALLY held your hand and explained everything.","A Wrinkle in Time",3410,2.6,0.1

"3413",1,"  Nothing redeeming about this movie. The acting is terrible, the characters are terrible, the story is terrible... It's all just terrible.","A Wrinkle in Time",3413,2.6,1.6
"3414",1,"  Infuriatingly, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" is far worse than I had steeled myself to expect based on various reviews and trailers. Granted, there are good points: excellent casting, good acting (in spite of the actors having little to work with), tactful modernization of the nearly 60 year old story, some clever original scenes, and (surprisingly) one or two well-executed scenes straight from the book. But a terrible screenplay and atrocious editing basically ruin the film (the last scene is a glacially-paced torture of cringe-worthy treacle). They made numerous ill-considered decisions about the narrative that weaken most of the characters in ways that seemed to me completely unnecessary, and - the greatest sin of all, to my mind - they simply do not appear to have trusted the book. And there is too much straight up exposition where one or two hints would suffice. The film's version of the story was flat... it lacked the depth, awe, reverence, humanity, compassion, and ""true-ness"" in the characters' reactions to the supernatural/spiritual forces they encounter that permeated L'Engle's story. The word ""universe"" is thrown about constantly but instead the focus is tight and myopic; not universal at all. I'm so disappointed. I feel like it would have been better if it were not made.","A Wrinkle in Time",3414,2.6,1.6
"3415",3,"  PROS: Nice wardrobeNice jokesCONS: Emotions was boring, needed work, eg. bollywood movies have this down. Best actor in movie was Reese Witherspoon.While watching the movie I was still waiting for it to start.","A Wrinkle in Time",3415,2.6,-0.4

"3420",4,"  This movie was better than expected! It fell flat in some ways-- like lines not being funny that were clearly supported to be-- but ultimately underneath it was a touching love letter to, not just black girls, but to ALL girls.

"3426",1,"  A Waste of Time! I should have been visited first by Mrs. Whybother! Thanks for ruining a classic with this disaster, taking a story of enduring worth, and instead manufacturing a mediocre series of plastic special effect gimmicks along with secular sermon drowned in 2018 platitudes of ""morality"". And the ending/resolution gets it completely, utterly wrong - and missed the largest possible point. Wow, what a terribly sad miss.","A Wrinkle in Time",3426,2.6,1.6
"3427",1,"  I score this movie one star only cause theres no lower rating and cause I like sparkly eyebrows, and there are many sparkly and expensive eyebrows in this movie. The editing and directing is a joke in this movie. Dont even get me started on the script. Even good actors couldnt save this one.. shame..","A Wrinkle in Time",3427,2.6,1.6
"3428",0.5,"  I've never been so disappointed in a Disney film. I'm not hard to please when it comes to the movies. All I ask is to be entertained. For all the visuals.... it was not at all entertaining... but instead, left you wanting something the director wasn't ever going to deliver. This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.. it really was that BAD. Poor directing, poor acting, poor writing... The actors only live up to the expectations the directors set for them..... In this instance, I'd put the blame for the box office BOMB onto the film's director. Save your money on this one.. and go see an entertaining film, like the Black Panther that does deliver!","A Wrinkle in Time",3428,2.6,2.1
"3429",1,"  Wrinkle In Time is a waste of time to see -- the acting is stiff except for a couple parts, and the mood is soppy, over the top. A few moments work, but save your time! Actually largely the effect is to insult the audience. I almost didn't criticize the unctuous PC virtue signaling to ""diversity"" --- seeing that this has become a highly public controversy. But it's just true, the movie has such pedantic and obvious (add-on, unnecessary and therefore offensively forced) references to Lefty Social Justice Warrior themes and personalities. Obviously beginning with the cast, and the Director's intro. Please! I'm a Diversity Trainer and I just find this crap overdone, counterproductive, self-righteous. Because Hollywood wasn't Lefty enough, right?? Quit ruining entertainment!","A Wrinkle in Time",3429,2.6,1.6
"3430",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time is visually stunning, imaginative, and even touching at times with strange but enjoyable performances by its cast, some talented (and even overacting) young stars, and a sense of magic and wonder, even if it can't quite live up to the imagination and charm of its source material!","A Wrinkle in Time",3430,2.6,-0.4
"3431",1,"  Weird, many themes, scenes, and points from the book missing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3431,2.6,1.6

I walked out with a great message that we all should be warriors of light fighting the darkness that surround our lives. No one better than Oprah Winfrey acting in the movie can deliver Such a powerful message. I recommend the movie as a family movie with your teenage kids. Enjoy. ?????? ?? ????","A Wrinkle in Time",3432,2.6,-1.4
"3433",1.5,"  I've often contended that ""boring"" is the worst thing a film can be. Wrinkle in Time makes me rethink that. An exercise in doing, saying & being too much, Wrinkle... certainly isn't boring, but it is bad. It has a lot in common with Tomorrowland: live-action, visually-heavy Disney fantasy-adventures, headed by lauded filmmakers, which celebrate braininess. But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster. It gets credit for being Disney's most enigmatic, eccentric experiments in years, taking visual and philosophical cues from Jodorowsky and Kubrick. Unfortunately, all intended awe and wonder is swallowed up by good, old-fashioned ineptness.The story of a girl having to ""tesser"" across the universe to find her long-lost dad gets some things right, including the critical casting of the lead girl. Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (""I like earthtones.""); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. These obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil ""It"" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels. A forgettable, messy waste of a great cast and iconic source material.","A Wrinkle in Time",3433,2.6,1.1
"3434",0.5,"  So disappointing how they butchered this classic story. If you loved the book like I did don't waste your time or your money because you will either be extremely disappointed or mad maybe even both.","A Wrinkle in Time",3434,2.6,2.1
"3435",5,"  Visually stunning. A great story, really enjoyed it!","A Wrinkle in Time",3435,2.6,-2.4
"3436",1.5,"  This movie felt like the characters were just wandering around aimlessly from bad special effect to bad special effect. Some of the child actors were decent but the youngest child was horrendous. Skip this film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3436,2.6,1.1
"3437",5,"  I loved this movie. My family saw it together (our daughter is 14) and we all loved it. We laughed, we cried, and in the end, our stand-offish teen held her dad's hand through the credits and out of the theatre. I think this is a must see for any teen girls. Its message of positivity and self-worth is one girls need to hear right now. I loved it, and I'd see it again!","A Wrinkle in Time",3437,2.6,-2.4
"3438",4,"  While definitely not for everyone, A Wrinkle in Time is a faithful, if messy, adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's controversial novel. Aided by vivid visuals, and a host of intriguing characters, Ava Duvernay's film is a unique family film and much darker than most family live action films by Disney. The storytelling is largely visual as the exposition heavy novel gets heavily streamlined in the opening scenes, creating confusion for those who are not familiar at all with the book. Still, the film adaptation won't work on everyone, as its optimistic and thoroughly cheesy hearted spectacle might annoy viewers looking for sophisticated fantasy. As a lover of the book, the film fulfills most of what I was hoping for and it is a dazzling film for brave kids. Rating: 77","A Wrinkle in Time",3438,2.6,-1.4
"3439",0.5,"  We saw this movie last week because the one we went to see wasn't playing as we thought. This was honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, maybe the worst. There aren't enough words in the whole English language to describe how horrible this movie is. I don't know what's worse, the bovine acting, the mind numbingly boring script, or the clumsy, bungling directing. I would give this movie negative 5 stars for wasting two hours of my life if I could.","A Wrinkle in Time",3439,2.6,2.1
"3440",2,"  I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO HAPPENS TO BE A FILMMAKER. I DON'T MEAN TO WRITE IN ALL CAPS, SO PLEASE PARDON. I AM ANNOYED THAT THIS INDUSTRIES' CULTURE OF CRITICS AND PR FOLKS WOULD DARE TRY TO BLAME THIS MOVIE'S POOR RATING ON POLITICS. THE FILM WAS DECENT, NOT GREAT. SURE, THE SOURCE MATERIAL WAS DIFFICULT, BUT SO ARE MANY OTHERS. THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RACE OR GENDER OF THE DIRECTOR OR THE CAST. IT'S ABOUT CRAFT. THE BEAUTY IS AVA HAD (AND HAS) THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A BIG BUDGET MEDIOCRE FILM, LIKE EVERY OTHER WHITE MALE FILMMAKER, WHO GETS MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO FAIL UNTIL THEY GET GOOD. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE. SHE STRUCK OUT, OKAY, FINE. SHE'LL GET MORE CHANCES TO MAKE A HOME RUN. AND IT'S THAT LAST PART -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO FAIL UPWARDS -- THAT SHOULD BE THE REAL THING TO POLITIC ABOUT. NEXT.","A Wrinkle in Time",3440,2.6,0.6
"3441",0.5,"  horrid from beginning to end who cast this? AnotherPC run amok wreck from Disney and company. The director needs some film school","A Wrinkle in Time",3441,2.6,2.1
"3442",4,"  I saw this movie on the Saturdat it came out and I was not disappointed! I read the book in the 6th grade and loved it! This is coming from someone who hates reading. I had low expectations for the movie, but the movie did the book justice. In my personal opinion (as well as my grandmother's) it was better than the book. It is an amazing story of a daughter and her adopted brother on an adventure with the girl's new friend to save her dad. This is an amazing family movie and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. I didn't expect something so well done from Disney.","A Wrinkle in Time",3442,2.6,-1.4
"3443",0.5,"  I haven't read the book but I can see how it might be good. However I've never wanted to walk out of a movie so bad. (I stayed because my husband wanted to laugh through it). At first I thought it may be good for small children (some of the characters were too cheesy to take seriously) but there are parts that may be too frightening for children. There is too much focus on weird psychedelic experiences and not enough character development. The touching parts weren't touching because it was all a joke. Surprised they got so many famous actors/actresses to participate.","A Wrinkle in Time",3443,2.6,2.1
"3444",4,"  I loved the movie honestly. The messages of empowerment, self esteem, love and light were incredibly personal and hit me in a pretty spectacular way. This movie is a win for representation and female empowerment.","A Wrinkle in Time",3444,2.6,-1.4
"3445",5,"  A beautiful inspiring movie about a little girl who is learning to love herself and saves her father and the universe with math! The design, costumes, performances (those kids were wonderful) were an immersive magical experience. A kids movie for sure, but so much to be enjoyed by grownups too!","A Wrinkle in Time",3445,2.6,-2.4
"3446",1,"  What a way to ruin a great book! No redeeming qualities. Big budget, big stars, big special effects complete fail.","A Wrinkle in Time",3446,2.6,1.6
"3447",1,"  I wanted to like this film. I really did. I loved the book as a kid and greatly enjoy most sci-fi/fantasy films even the critically reviewed ""bad"" ones. So, I went with an open mind. Unfortunately, by almost any metric, the film is awful. The casting was unbelievable, the celebrities playing over the top dress up was distracting, and the dialog *somehow* made even less sense than in the book. I was really disappointed. Someone told me that by watching the film, I should appreciate that I was making a political statement. My intent was to be entertained, not engage in the civil discourse. Epic fail on my part.","A Wrinkle in Time",3447,2.6,1.6
"3448",0.5,"  If you read the book don't go see this movie. If you haven't read the book stay at home and read it instead of seeing this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3448,2.6,2.1
"3449",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time is a mediocre movie at best. The story of one girl's journey to find her father (and her self) is very powerful. The special effects are stunning and groundbreaking. Where the film falls short is on two levels. First, it takes too many liberties with the source material. With its religious undertones in the book, the film disregards all of those elements that helped drive the story and characters to the climatic end. Second, it is a film with hesitation. It tries to be somewhat true to the original source material while trying to update it for the modern audience. It leads to some moments being awkward and unpolished. If you want to see a well polished film, that is faithful to it's source material, then I would not watch this film","A Wrinkle in Time",3449,2.6,-0.4
"3450",5,"  My takeaways from Ava DuVernay's, A Wrinkle In Time:1. You are enough. Perfectly created in every way.2. Be fearless. Don't let the negativity of the world dim your light.3. Be a light to the world in the midst of darkness. We can all make a difference.-Thank you for the reminder, Ava!","A Wrinkle in Time",3450,2.6,-2.4
"3451",0.5,"  Mosh boring movie EVER! Fell asleep & my kids did too!","A Wrinkle in Time",3451,2.6,2.1

"3453",0.5,"  worst movie...not even a bit of interesting anything in the movie","A Wrinkle in Time",3453,2.6,2.1
"3454",2,"  Sstarted out good, but got frustrating in the middle. By the end my daughter and I were both disinterested. Disappointing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3454,2.6,0.6
"3455",0.5,"  They stripped Christianity from this movie, then they attempted to sell it back to us on the whim of progressive ideals. Fail, fail, fail.","A Wrinkle in Time",3455,2.6,2.1
"3456",3,"  Much better then the previews led you to believe. Loved the book and the movie did OK - followed it more then Peter Jackson did for the Hobbit :) 13 out of 20 stars","A Wrinkle in Time",3456,2.6,-0.4
"3457",1,"  What could have been a great movie, turned out to be missing the main part of the original story, Christianity! The movie lacks what made the original story magical. This film was a total let down! Our entire group was let down!","A Wrinkle in Time",3457,2.6,1.6
"3458",2,"  Disappearing jackets, skipping parts of the book. Left people confused after the ending, anticlimatic. I read the book in middle school, hating it, but I came to this movie with hopes because it had an amazing cast and director but ultimately it failed, it didn't capture the total idea of the book, it glossed over important facts...and again, DISAPPEARING JACKETS.","A Wrinkle in Time",3458,2.6,0.6
"3459",2,"  This is not a very good movie because of sjw politics and bad acting. It had good SFX, but I expected better of an oprah movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3459,2.6,0.6
"3460",1,"  This movie hurt my eyes and stole some IQ points from me, ouch and ugh.","A Wrinkle in Time",3460,2.6,1.6
"3461",4.5,"  This movie was absolutely stunning to look at. The supportive women was one of the most empowering aspect of this movie to me which made the movie so much more fun to watch. Not to to mention their beautiful graphics, costume design, and sets met a wide range of depth to the movie. The movie is not simple, but its main theme is that in order to defeat darkness in this world, one must know who they are to fight back with strength, not with ego or revenge.","A Wrinkle in Time",3461,2.6,-1.9
"3462",4,"  great for kids and inspiring. Has some meh moments, but got me a few times","A Wrinkle in Time",3462,2.6,-1.4
"3463",2.5,"  I wanted to love this. But this is a Christian story and the stripping of all vestiges of its Christian foundation rendered the story confusing and pointless. In addition, the constant inappropriate longing glances and near kisses from 11/12 year olds was unnecessary. But worst of all, Reese Witherspoon as ""Mrs Whatsit"" was a bully and not the inspiration I wanted her to be to young Meg. Having an adult bully and already bullied child was a weird choice.","A Wrinkle in Time",3463,2.6,0.1
"3464",2,"  Visually stunning, but only tangentially connected to the classic book. A real disappointment from a storytelling perspective.","A Wrinkle in Time",3464,2.6,0.6
"3465",1.5,"  I was leery of seeing this after the trailers, but hoped the glittery wardrobes would not take away from the original story. But instead of an epic drama done with the finesse of LOTR and Harry Potter, I had to slog through a fluffy ""power of girl"" coming of age take. The movie was pleasant enough, but was a bubble gum version of a novel that has gripped readers for decades with the stories that each of the characters carries. I can't see book sales taking off thanks to the movie. My kids were in hysterics at the phoniness of the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3465,2.6,1.1
"3466",1,"  UNLESS YOU HAVE A DISCOMBOBULATED HEAD FETISH DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","A Wrinkle in Time",3466,2.6,1.6
"3467",2,"  Well intentioned, with a strong performance by its lead, and probably deserving a a fully animated treatment, the immersion is ripped away by terribly integrated CGI and awkwardly jilted lines.","A Wrinkle in Time",3467,2.6,0.6
"3468",1.5,"  WE loved the book. They author beautifully illustrated God's Love and how God chooses to use the smallest of people to fight the darkness. Disney took out every reference to God. They made a movie about the power of loving yourself. That's a fine message, but there are plenty of movies available with that theme. This book was so much bigger than that. So I think if you loved the book, it's possible you won't be a fan of the movie. If you've never read the book, the movie will be very confusing. Save your money.","A Wrinkle in Time",3468,2.6,1.1
"3469",0.5,"  Horribly disappointing. Barely follows the classic book. Boring. This is a film to promote Oprah as god like and they don't even try to disguise it-they literally made her larger than life. Boo to Disney on this one.","A Wrinkle in Time",3469,2.6,2.1
"3470",1,"  Save your money. Not worth watching. I thought Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon were pretty good, but not enough to carry the rest of the cast. I felt like it was a place for Oprah to get on a soap box and preach. Felt more like an hour and half worth of talk show rhetoric. Truly not much plot line.....this could have been a fantastic movie. VERY DISAPPOINTED.","A Wrinkle in Time",3470,2.6,1.6
"3471",2.5,"  while there are things i do like about this movie,i mostly found my self cringing in the theater. the effects are fine, the acting is passable although rarely in the film do they show normal human emotion to jaw dripping things like a godzilla sized oprah. but by far the worst thing about this film is Charles Goddamn Wallace!","A Wrinkle in Time",3471,2.6,0.1
"3472",3,"  A Wrinkle IN Time is too fast paced fro the audience to understand the true message of the story. the special effect are amazing and if you look past the bland plot then you will see the beauty of the story. The other problem is that if you haven't read the book then you probably won't understand the film, and if you have read the book then you will see how far it steers from the original story.","A Wrinkle in Time",3472,2.6,-0.4
"3473",4,"  It may be a little hokey and overwrought at times, but it's full of genuine wonder, emotion, and optimism. I mean, it's a fantasy movie! Though it may not be a perfect movie, or adaptation, it's true to the spirit of the source material and a great movie for a child (or childlike spirit) to see.","A Wrinkle in Time",3473,2.6,-1.4
"3474",0.5,"  Complete waste of time, no point, plotless, dull, and irrelevant.","A Wrinkle in Time",3474,2.6,2.1
"3475",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time was my favorite book as a child, and I do not recommend this movie to anyone else who loved the book. Visually stunning and full of childhood magic, it loses any grit and reality the book had with completely flat characters. I love that every child could see themselves in this movie, but after being so excited from the day I heard this movie was being made, I was deeply, deeply disappointed. Disney, step up your game..","A Wrinkle in Time",3475,2.6,-0.4
"3476",4,"  A few script problems, few dumb moments, but not nearly enough to make this film awful. The acting across the board is really good with Storm Reid being perfect as Meg. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I can see why some might not enjoy it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3476,2.6,-1.4
"3477",3.5,"  It's a great message: believe in yourself and love can change the world. The light can drive out the dark. It's a message I believe in. But this felt like such an extravagant vehicle to get this message across. By being so over the top, it kind of lost the heart of the story. I love Oprah, but I was not a fan of giant Oprah, much better to be the same size of the other Ms. The costumes were eye-popping, could be an Oscar nomination for those! The kids were great, all the actors were great, but it tried to be too dazzling and lost some connection. Still worth seeing, imho, if you're a fan of the book but not necessarily a purist as there are some changes.","A Wrinkle in Time",3477,2.6,-0.9
"3478",5,"  Great movie and great story or finding your puropose","A Wrinkle in Time",3478,2.6,-2.4

"3481",1,"  Ooo, yeah. You know that feeling you had when you left the theater after seeing Black Panther? Yea, Uh, no. You'll leave the theater feeling the polar opposite, and you'll wish you could get your wrinkle in time back (and your money). This was just awful on so many levels. It was a poor script, poor acting and crazy editing. The direction was ""interesting"" at best. And the acting? Just no. Save your coins, or go see Black Panther again. Trust me. ;)","A Wrinkle in Time",3481,2.6,1.6
"3482",2,"  The selling point of this film is Oprah. The plot was boring and underdeveloped. The graphics, however, were phenomenal.","A Wrinkle in Time",3482,2.6,0.6

"3484",5,"  Wow, this is a great film!","A Wrinkle in Time",3484,2.6,-2.4
"3485",5,"  This has always been one of my favorite books and I loved the movie as well, despite a little heavy-handedness on the messages. It's great to see a movie with strong women, a starring role for a young girl, science-based principles (einstein's theory of relativity), as well as both adventure and emotion. I'd go again in a heartbeat!","A Wrinkle in Time",3485,2.6,-2.4
"3486",2,"  I had high hopes and was very disappointed with this version. The fx and visuals are great, but the story was gutted. If you like the book at all, the 2004 version (also by disney) is much, much better, despite fewer bells and whistles. I suppose for someone who hasn't read the book, it would be ok. Otherwise, don't waste your money, go hunt up the older one.","A Wrinkle in Time",3486,2.6,0.6

"3489",1,"  Awful, awful, awful....I read the book first and it was really good. the movie was beyond cheesy. I almost walked out half way through. save your money and time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3489,2.6,1.6
"3490",1,"  ""A Wrinkle in Time"" has a handful of scenes of that prompt intrigue and wonder. These are executed extremely well and done with great care.Unfortunately, the overall narrative is muddied by an overly busy plot that lacks any sense of continuity and direction. So, we arrive at the end not fully knowing how we got there. That, and some of the performances here are not good.It was ambitious and well-intended. But good intentions don't always result in actual good.","A Wrinkle in Time",3490,2.6,1.6
"3491",1,"  This movie was a Big Disappointment, as a child I loved the book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3491,2.6,1.6
"3492",4,"  Why in hell is A Wrinkle in Time getting so many bad reviews? America is really sick. I was really touched by this movie especially because I know how it feels to want to save your father from peril. My father was an alcoholic and throughout my childhood I wanted to heal and save my father from his demons. Well the young heroine of the film did it - she rescued her father! The audience was clapping when the film ended. I wanted to cry. A Wrinkle in Time is a wonderful family movie. Please go see this movie with your children.","A Wrinkle in Time",3492,2.6,-1.4
"3493",5,"  Loved it! I read the book as a child and it was my favorite. Saw the first Disney movie and it was great. I just Love this story.","A Wrinkle in Time",3493,2.6,-2.4
"3494",2,"  Wait until it comes out on Netflix! on the one hand, the acting seemed to salvage a hastily written screenplay, but on the other hand, the superficial roles by each character and a plot that wasn't easy to follow unless you read the book spoil what could have been a better screen adaptation. i see potential in the young actors, but there are a lot of things that only experience can teach them that they will need to acquire in order to have acting careers!","A Wrinkle in Time",3494,2.6,0.6
"3495",5,"  I know a lot of people didnt like this, but i honestly cant figure out why. I know the story is kinda kitchy, and goes a bit all over the place, but i feel like that was intentional. Life is a bit all over the place. Ava duverney was able to fit into a beatly wrapped barra something that isn't totally neatly wrapped at all times. I Enjoyed the story itself and feel like i got what i was promised; a disney movIe with a ""feel good"" ending. I also loved the References throughout to strock Black HISTORICAL FIGURES! Side note: 50+ foot tall oprah = <3","A Wrinkle in Time",3495,2.6,-2.4
"3496",5,"  I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It is not a perfect match to the book, and I didn't expect it to be. The director made each change deliberately and the love and thoughfulness put into this movie shows at every turn. The visuals and art direction were stunning and unique, something I always appreciate when I go to see a movie. But bottom line, my kids loved this movie and got to see a preteen girl be the hero using her wits and her faults to save the day even when the adults failed. fantastic.","A Wrinkle in Time",3496,2.6,-2.4
"3497",4,"  Overall, an admiraBle attemPt at a book that is ""unflimable!"" Storm reid did a fantastic job, as did the rest of the Child actors on the movie, definitely had room for improvemEnt to make it less preachy and to develop more of some of the characters (aka calVin). But I'd see it agaiN and as a children's story i believe it is a great movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3497,2.6,-1.4
"3498",0.5,"  Terrible movie that doesn't represent the book in the least.","A Wrinkle in Time",3498,2.6,2.1
"3499",5,"  I watched a Wrinkle in time with my 3 year old niece who has never sat through a movie. She sat through this whole movie! It was quite the adventure with so many seeds I hope are planted in the hearts of children who see it. I've never read the book, so I don't know how true it is to it's literature but it is an amazing magical movie. What an escape from all of the world's negativity, this work of light by ava duvernay.","A Wrinkle in Time",3499,2.6,-2.4
"3500",1,"  They tessered until it wrinkled the story.I gave one star because the costumes were well done. The movie is just meh. I watched this after I finished reading the book. From the beginning, I knew I wasn't going to be able to compare the book and the movie. After watching the first 15 minutes, I got confused with how the director told the story. My husband who didn't read the book fell asleep cuz it was too confusing and boring. While I really wanted to support the girl power in this movie, I don't think the director knew how to translate the story to the big screen. Not to mention - the acting of Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin were so plain and weren't convincing enough to tesser us to a different universe. Sorry kids, try again next time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3500,2.6,1.6
"3501",2.5,"  It's a rare site in children's movies to see truly stunning visuals, however this film breaks out of that standard. Entire worlds collapse and restructure within seconds, and incredible embodiments of pure evil are visualized faultlessly. While traveling the stars, meg, charles and the celestial guides go through a process called ""tessering"", which is accompanied by jaw-dropping colors, warps and waves. The hyperrealistic depictions of deep-space planets inspire awe at the wonder of life itself, and never for a second cast doubt on the reality of these other worlds.However, the visuals is where it stops. The plot failed to captivate my mind, and the characters were hardly interesting. Disney might want to reallocate a little more of their visuals budget for some better writing next time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3501,2.6,0.1
"3502",4,"  It is a beautiful picture with a good pace, not too fast. Storm Reid gave an excellent performance. Ava DeVernay did a great job. I will see this again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3502,2.6,-1.4
"3503",1,"  The commercials praise A Wrinkle In Time as ""empowering"" and ""inspiring"". Either would matter if it was also entertaining. It's got a new song by Sade at least. That ain't nothing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3503,2.6,1.6

"3506",5,"  A Wrinkle IN Time was my favourite Book as a child. I also reread it 4 times in the last 6 years to my 3 daughters. I took 10 kids to see the move and as you can imagine I had a lot invested in this being awesome. Guess what? I really enjoyed the film and the vision. I have read a bunch of the personal reviews and it's ironic that most of the things people dont like are specific to the story in the book. This is a very very hard story to adapt to the screen, there is so much internal struggle and sweetness, despair, Darkness, Light and spirituality in the book. I love the attempt, the vision and the result. WAS it perfect, no. Was it wonderful, yes.","A Wrinkle in Time",3506,2.6,-2.4
"3507",3.5,"  While visually stunning, it misses the mark, mostly because of too many changes to the original (and very beloved) story by Madeliene l'engle. In particular, aunt beast was written out. While not appearing until near the end of the book, aunt beast helped meg understand there are no easy answers and deal with the misplaced anger she has towards her father. Most perplexing is the inclusion of a new character, a bully named Veronica who seems to have no purpose in the plot.","A Wrinkle in Time",3507,2.6,-0.9

I re-read the book foR the first time in 36 years RECENTLY And found it to be as fun and IMAGINATIVE as is this film adaptation is. I think they might have been better off splitting The movie into two parts to stay a little closerTo the orGinal storyline but other than that. It is FreSh, beautiully shot and very entertaining. It is a little scary for Those 6 and under but other than that it is good family fun.","A Wrinkle in Time",3509,2.6,-0.9

"3515",1,"  Simply awful. I wish I could find a wrinkle in Time to get those two hours of my life back. I suppose I should say slightly less than two hours. So much of the movie was just randomness that appeared to be trying to fill time to make it long enough to be considered a movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3515,2.6,1.6
"3516",2.5,"  Superb Colour Palate. Lovely cinematography, costume and set design, and bits of heartfelt acting, but full of plotholes and nebulous dialogue that could have been avoided by following the outlines of L'Engle's book more closely. Definitely a fun, if a bit confusing, watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3516,2.6,0.1
"3517",5,"  I loved the movie. It was beautiful and moving. The cast was EXCELLENT. It is not a perfect version of the book. But it is a gooD family movie with lots of adventure and heart. I Saw it with friends. I Plan to see it agAin with my kids.","A Wrinkle in Time",3517,2.6,-2.4
"3518",5,"  No surprise all the white male reviewers don't get this movie. It is a feminine film and a visual poem about the power of love. It is a children's movie made for children and every woman who never got to see herself represented as the hero in a children's story.","A Wrinkle in Time",3518,2.6,-2.4
"3519",2,"  Was expectiNg alot more due to the great cast but somehow the movie was not well put together, my daughters read the book and said it was nothing compared to it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3519,2.6,0.6
"3520",2,"  Diversity for the sake of diversity gives us A Wrinkle in Time: a mediocre movie at best. When the only asset is the diverse cast, Sorry not sorry, it does not make it good. The dialogue feels forced and the plot is bland. Black Panther did not have these types of problem.","A Wrinkle in Time",3520,2.6,0.6

"3530",4.5,"  Going to see this movie you must watch it through the wonder of a child. When you do that, while it is a little slow to build for adults and leaves you with a few lingering questions when the story ends, it is wonderful. To see so many powerful and strong women, as well as a diverse cast on screen, you can't helped but be moved.","A Wrinkle in Time",3530,2.6,-1.9
"3531",0.5,"  VAPITY thy name is A WRINKLE IN TIME. THIS MOVIE IS THE HOLLOW UNIVERSE.","A Wrinkle in Time",3531,2.6,2.1
"3532",2,"  Just meh. It did not do the book Justice. The director was overly concerned about using cgi hand let the story telling flop. The dialog felt disjointed and bad editing reinforced the discomfort. They found was to pull at heart strings, but it was obvious and short lived.","A Wrinkle in Time",3532,2.6,0.6
"3533",3.5,"  Overall, I enjoyed this film. In it's effort to simplify the narrative of the book - I think it chose to spend its time on the wrong areas. for the MRs. characters - they could've have been a bit more light hearted (at least at times). I loved the casting especially for the kids and the happy medium. Good fun for target age - though i hoped it was going to be stronger.","A Wrinkle in Time",3533,2.6,-0.9
"3534",0.5,"  There was a cgi overload. Some imporant Parts were miSsing from the moive. ALsO some Of the stOry line did not connect at all. The three mrS. Were all Amazing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3534,2.6,2.1
"3535",1,"  Disney removed the central theme of the book, Christianity, thus creating a shallow, uninteresting movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3535,2.6,1.6

"3537",2.5,"  Instead of the director giving a ""thank you"" message before the preview, she should instead offer an apology.","A Wrinkle in Time",3537,2.6,0.1
"3538",2,"  i was really into this movie until the instant that oprah winfrey showed up on the screen. She broke the ""magic"" of the film because she has such a gigantic cultural imprint already. it was impossible to not think 'that's oprah there on the screen"".","A Wrinkle in Time",3538,2.6,0.6
"3539",5,"  This movie brings together the world of adults and children. the beauty of science and magic is shown. If you don't see it with an open heart and mind you won't Enjoy it. This movie reminds us of the beauty of love anD life. It teaches us to love ourselves and to value what we have (including our faults)","A Wrinkle in Time",3539,2.6,-2.4
"3540",3,"  Most of the messaging from the book is still there but the pacing of the movement seems clunky. They took out the whole explanation of the ant walking on a string bit (which is the foundation of the title) which is mind boggling to me. Most of the acting was good except for the teachers and calvin....who just randomly appears of out no where and who was extremely bad at acting.","A Wrinkle in Time",3540,2.6,-0.4
"3541",5,"  My two daughters and I went to see this film. one of them is 10 and one is eleven. They both loved it so much and both almost cryed. This film is amazing because a lot of people can relate to meg and seeing a black female on screen is very important.","A Wrinkle in Time",3541,2.6,-2.4
"3542",5,"  This is a Wonderful movie to share with children as it touches on issues of loss and disappointment that are difficult to reach in any meaningful way with simple talk. Perhaps other movie-goers were disappointed that this is not the standard marvel comic special effects action movie. it is definitely more gentle and offers a model of how to treat others with kindness.. it helps that the cast is wonderfully diverse and the eleven year old is a realistic heroine. The visuals do not disappoint, either. and the actors turn in powerful performances.. i think the low ratings simply reflect the fact movie goers have become accustomed to patterns of mediocrity. that refuse to delve into and explore real human emotions.","A Wrinkle in Time",3542,2.6,-2.4
"3543",0.5,"  JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PC CORRECTED GARBAGE.you'd THINK THEY GOT THE HINT THAT PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY SICK OF HOLLYWOOD CREATING THE WORLD IN THEIR OWN IMAGE.","A Wrinkle in Time",3543,2.6,2.1
"3544",1,"  ALL CAP due to website, reload or pressing Caps did not help, sorry.Saw it the first night it was out. Had high hopes, due to the trailer and it was just disappointing.No magic or spark in the movie. was it the script? I thought the acting was decent. but it just did not resonate with me, at all.At least Black Panther made a $1B globally, which will help Disney soften the blow from this disaster movie. Hurricane Heist is probably better, or for a sure bet try watching Thoroughbred.","A Wrinkle in Time",3544,2.6,1.6
"3545",4.5,"  Wonderful movie. Heroine is a young teen woman who makes a physical journey through space and time with her younger brother and a friend to save her dad, and makes a journey within, discovering her own beauty, strength and power. I'm a fan of the book, and like all movies from books, it is different from the book. The movie captures the spirit and heart of the book. This is a children's movie.. There are some scary Stepford wives type scenes and a creepy beach scene - and the It is a scary brain that influences thoughts and emotions. There are no intergalactic spaceship fights, the fight is for hearts and minds. I would compare it favorably to the Wizard of Oz, and both versions of the Wiz - even though it is not a musical. Has something in common with the first Spy Kids movie that really had the children as the heroes - that one featured a Latino family. Enjoyed seeing it in a theater filled with children and their parents - the children loved it! At the end, everyone clapped! Do something good for your spirit and go see this film!","A Wrinkle in Time",3545,2.6,-1.9

"3549",0.5,"  The dark, difficult theme of the original story is buried under appalling costuming, mediocre acting, and happy emphasis on politically correct messaging. who can't deliver great cgi today? great cgi does not add bonus points to a badly scripted story. read the book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3549,2.6,2.1

"3551",1,"  This movie was HORRIBLE. This is the first time I ever felt I wanted my money back. Disney has devolved into a political propaganda machine that sees its role as overturning everything about traditional America.","A Wrinkle in Time",3551,2.6,1.6

THE ONLY THINGS OF THIS FILM TO DRAW YOU IN, IS WHAT YOU WILL SEE IN THE TRAILERS, AN AMAZING CAST LINEUP AND BEAUTIFUL VIDEOGRAPHY....BUT THAT IS ALL. THE STORY HAS THE POTENTIAL OF HAVING SOME MOVING MOMENTS AND POSITIVE THEMES, BUT SKIPS ON THE CONNECTION POINTS AND LEFT THIS VIEWER COMPLETELY DISCOMBOBULATED.","A Wrinkle in Time",3559,2.6,2.1

"3561",1,"  ANOTHER BAD MOVIE FROM DISNEY..... When will it stop? they wouldn't make a sequel to tron legacy, but they crank bad stories out like this one? i have also heard rumors that this director was going to be tapped to do star wars (which is a total mess now) or a marvel movie.

"3569",2,"  I was so disappointed by this film. A cast this solid in its acting strength (at least among the adult cast), a director this talented, a production so visionary in its use of color and style, and a source material as innovative as madeleine L'engle's seminal novel should have all come together to create a stellar film. somehow, as mysteriously as the mechanics of tesseracts, almost all the magic disappeared in the conversion from print to film. There are a few moments here and there that serve as inklings of the movie that this tried to be: Mrs. Which comforting Meg upon their arrival on Orion, Mrs. Whatsit's adorably verbose absent-mindedness, and the undeniable chemistry between the actors playing Meg's parents all leapt off the screen. But amid those brighter flashes was poor child acting, a distracting barrage of extreme close-ups for no discernible reason, obvious inflation of the run time through transparent plot devices (Calvin falling off Mrs. Whatsit as she was flying, some forest-tornado thing erupting on Camazotz, etc.), rushed lines that should be interesting but don't land due to the way they are filmed, and a host of other nuts and bolts issues that unforgivably weakened this film. Honestly, because all the pieces are so clearly there, I wish that Ava DuVernay would agree to a series of reshoots in order to give audiences the film that they truly deserve.","A Wrinkle in Time",3569,2.6,0.6
"3570",1,"  We took my 10 year old daughter. It held her attention., but the movie went nowhere for all its hype and inter stellar potential. Vivid colors but overall it was a flop. Sorry oprah","A Wrinkle in Time",3570,2.6,1.6
"3571",1,"  One of thenworstI just felt like they did not take the time to explain much of anything before throwing the viewer into this weird universe. They skipped over so much (I'm sure it made a lot more sense to people who read the book) and didn't take much time for character development so, as a first time viewer, I didn't much care about the characters which meant I lost interest in the storyline. I felt the film was underdevelopand rushed the story and, if I'm being honest, the acting was the worst part. I felt like this was everyone's first time acting....it felt more like broadway dramatized ""over"" acting than actual movie acting (very different techniques) which made it sort of corny to me....forced jokes.","A Wrinkle in Time",3571,2.6,1.6
"3572",5,"  light and Dark. Soul and Depression. understanding what the Light is, how to build and sustain it is a personal journey for all with many paths.

"3577",4,"  A Wrinkle in Time is the family movie you have been waiting for. It is an emotionally stirring journey through the human condition that will energize and captivate you. The movie is a must see for teens and tweens.I went into A Wrinkle in Time with no knowledge of the storyline. I have never read the book and I thought the movie looked a little gaudy and strange in the trailer. However, from the first few minutes of the movie, I was hooked. The movie is about family, sacrifice, understanding your worth, and choosing to be a warrior for good.A Wrinkle in Time is an absolutely beautiful film, both in content and cinematography. There is much to see and learn. The media screening I attended included a short clip from Ava DuVerney, the movie's director. She shared that she wanted to create a movie about joy and she invited the audience to watch it through the eyes of your 11 or 12 year old self. I took her advice and prepared myself for something I hoped would be special. I cried tears of joy and love in this movie more than once and I do not often cry at movies.A Wrinkle in Time gracefully deals with so many issues: bullying, adoption, loss, self-hate, evil, selfishness, abuse, and forgiveness. I am sure that some will see political themes in the film, but I felt A Wrinkle in Time transcended that and reminded us all that we need to embrace the light in humanity and try to understand one another. A Wrinkle in Time is a beautifully diverse movie with a big heart.A Wrinkle in Time is a Wizard of Oz or Neverending Story for this generation of teens and older tweens. If they only watch one movie this year, I hope it is this one. However, it might be a little scary for younger children as there are some perilous scenes and a violent attempt on a main character's life. You know your kid best","A Wrinkle in Time",3577,2.6,-1.4
"3578",0.5,"  It's like one of those movies that make you think about it for a while but I'm just thinking about if I have ever watched a worse movie than this. I'd give one star for visual fx and that's it. Shit acting across the board, shit direction, shit screenwriting and cinematography. They could have produced a one hour Lincoln commercial with Matthew McConaughey rolling a booger between his fingers and it'd be better than this.","A Wrinkle in Time",3578,2.6,2.1

The musical score drowned out the NARRATIVES. The movie had a thEme of leadership, but the film Was completely mismanaged. I felt like pIne was APOLOGIZING for the eNtire movIe. Plastic and lifelEss. This could have been a theatrical MASTERPIECE with an enchanting MUSICAL scoRe and instead it landed in the Land of wtf?!

"3585",0.5,"  i READ "" A wrinkle in time"" when I was a kid and loved it. It was a great book, but this movie takes out the main theme of the story and changes the book way to much. It is a shame that hollywood and disney are so arrogant as to think they could improve on this book, when it was already a great classic. when will the idiots with small brains learn they cannot.","A Wrinkle in Time",3585,2.6,2.1
"3586",5,"  When I was watching this movie, I felt like I was sharing a memory. It was brilliantly done and was visually fantastic. It completely blew me away. I'm not EXAGgerating when I say that this movie has changed my life. A Wrinkle In Time has INSPIRED me to take on things I never thought were possible.

"3589",2.5,"  Everything good in this movie (and there is some) is from the book. Everything bad is the new material for the movie. They made an iconic scifi fantasy trite with lengthy speeches that just didn't work. The scary bits from the book that resembled The Prisoner or Twilight Zone episodes were cut down to make room for more self-help speeches and more material about the bad science and poor world building. The humor referenced modern stuff and didn't land. The music was ill fitting and the audio was terrible. Oprah Winfrey is a huge distraction from the role she's supposed to be.The good parts were that I haven't read the book since I was a child and the movie suggested what didn't occur to me at that time. It helps if you have a background in Dungeons and Dragons Planescape, because it seems obvious now that that is essentially what was going on. The guides are celestial angel-types, the traveling is actually through afterlife type worlds where your mind and morality mean more than physics, which is why so much attention is paid to feelings rather than the pittance paid to real world science. For those who don't know Planescape, CS Lewis' Heaven and Hell based scifi is more relevant than Niven or Asimov.","A Wrinkle in Time",3589,2.6,0.1
"3590",4,"  It was a decent movie with a lot of heart and stunning visuals. There are definitely changes made in the translation from book to screen, some of which work really well and others that personally annoyed me (though I did just reread the book, so it is fresh). Meg's arc especially works well. If you go in with an open mind, this film is very enjoyable.","A Wrinkle in Time",3590,2.6,-1.4

"3593",5,"  I spent a long time thinking about this movie after seeing it. I loved the dramatic twist at the end. I love how -evil- was portrayed. it was easy to identify with Meg, our protagonist. the way it played out... parts at the beginning which seemed distastful all tied into the plot later. every moment i was engaged, i didn't know what would happen next. it was refreshingly different from the other movies we've seen, and excellent coming of age story. also Mrs. whatsit, played by reese witherspoon, was fantastic.","A Wrinkle in Time",3593,2.6,-2.4
"3594",5,"  Loved it. Full of heart and inspiration.","A Wrinkle in Time",3594,2.6,-2.4
"3595",4,"  Trying to fit all of the source material into one feature-length film means that a lot of the original action was cut. there is a small pacing problem as a result - lots of buildup, then an almost unbelievably swift resolution. but overall, the film is heartwarming, engaging, evocative, modern, empowering, and stunningly beautiful to look at.","A Wrinkle in Time",3595,2.6,-1.4
"3596",5,"  THis movie was visually stunning, beautiful, poignant and full of heart. If you don't like it I question if you are criticizing because you expected this to be what you thought it would be when you read the book as a child. If you still didn't get it perhaps you did not read the book at all. It was at its core about the power of love, LOVE of family and that of the self. For those upset about its lack of religious undertones...what is Jesus if not love? Have some charity...have a heart...Go see this movie the world is full of critics this has what we all need most... Love and this movie, cast and director have mine!","A Wrinkle in Time",3596,2.6,-2.4
"3597",0.5,"  Horrible adaptation. They removed the christianity from a Christian fantasy story and replaced it with daytime pop psychology. THey gutted the characterizations of both Mrs. Whatsit and the happy medium. Mrs. Whatsit's attitude towards meg was so annoying! It wouldn't be that hard to make a good film from the book. If they could do it with Harry Potter, they could do it with a wrinkle in time. They would just need to make a longer movie that focused on plot and character, not eye popping cgi! I want a version of A wrinkle in time that includes the twins, the star-gazing rock, and Aunt beastie! I know some changes would be inevitable, but this film actually complicated scenes that could have been simpler and therefore more powerful. The least they could have done to show respect for L'engle and her christian fans was to let them list jesus as a light. He is so much more, but they couldn't even do that. The talented and diverse cast is the only positive thing about this movie.The reason for making a beloved book into a film is having a ready audience in the fans. Why make the book into a movie, then drain it of everything the fans love? Why dumb it down for the sake of CGI? I haven't been so disappointed since the Seeker: The Dark is Rising came out and A wrinkle time made a lot of the same mistakes.","A Wrinkle in Time",3597,2.6,2.1
"3598",5,"  THIS IS A WONDEFUL ADAPTION OF THE BOOK, and a beautiful film in general. It carries a type of intelligent, unabashedly positive message that we don't see enough of anymore. CLEverly adapted from the book and well written, I COULD have seen my eleven year old self completely enthralled. Even as a somewhat jaded adult, I found myself choking back a tear in several scenes. In the MODERN age of instant Gratification media, a wrinkle in time does something unusual, it takes its time and builds suspense. It also doesn't speak down to its audience. Its a good film for all ages in this viewers opinion. I Will see it again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3598,2.6,-2.4
"3599",0.5,"  Extremely disappointing!!! The heart of this story is the Universal story of good verses evil. The movie narrowed the Moral to a new age teen angst movIe. Madeleine L'Engle is in a genre of christian Fiction author, as the movIe take specific efforts to remoVe any trace of the authors faith. RegardleSs of anyones personal Beliefs this does injust to the authors artwork. Some of the more stUnning and impactful moments in the book were reduced to jokes in the movie. I brought my 8 year old daughter to the movie and even she left disappointed. I never leave reviews for anything and if i do it is only positive. This is the first time i have ever left a negative review for anything. It was that Disapointing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3599,2.6,2.1
"3600",1,"  Terrible! Nothing like the book. wHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT; A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.","A Wrinkle in Time",3600,2.6,1.6
"3601",5,"  Loved it!!! FantastiC movie. I liked that it wasnt OverboArd with constant maximum action overkill. Great meSsages throughout for the self-aware audience.","A Wrinkle in Time",3601,2.6,-2.4
"3602",5,"  I admit, I went into this movie expecting this disappointment of Pete's Dragon, especially after seeing a few reviews giving it a less than stellar number of stars. However, upon leaving the theater, I felt the same lightness and joy I experienced watching Wonder. The film had a deep heart, displaying the power of love and the worth of humans-- and that we can deserve love for being ourselves, rather than constantly striving for approval.A Wrinkle in Time featured charming actors, with Storm Reid stealing the scenes as the persnickety, precocious Meg Murry. Deric McCabe is perfectly cast as the impercetable and brilliant Charles Wallace, while Levi Miller's kind Calvin consistently offers the support Meg needs to save the day. The Mrs.'s, played by Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon, are dazzling, beautiful, wise, brave, and unknowable as they guide the children on first a search and then a rescue mission, giving the children the courage and tools to fight the darkness. I read this book in 5th grade and despised the slow classroom pace and the drying of the novel's appeal with homework and questions. As an English teacher, I revisited the book this past Christmas and quickly devoured others in the series, captivated by the flawed, clever fighter who is Meg Murry. I found permission to be a smart, capable woman as well as permission to live with flaws and not constantly try to cover them up in shame. I found a deeper appreciation for the people around me and a desire to reach out and make the world a better place. While a two hour movie does not allow for the depth of development we find in books, this film adaption does good job of opening many of those doors for viewers. Ryan Coogler's praise for director Ava DuVernay is well earned with a fantastic, diverse cast, beautiful scenery, and spot on emotional appeals. This film will inspire people to love themselves and spread joy, it will inspire viewers to find a solution other than violence, inspire girls to be scientists and dreamers, and inspire us all to look for the wonder just beyond our view.","A Wrinkle in Time",3602,2.6,-2.4
"3603",1,"  So boring and cheesy. No story, bad makeup/costumes, boring predictable dialogue. Both my daughter and I fell asleep half way through when we Realized the Story was going nowhere. Big cast that fell short. Felt like a low budget movie, not Disney like.","A Wrinkle in Time",3603,2.6,1.6
"3604",1.5,"  OMITTED SO MUCH OF THE BOOK AND ADDED THINGS NOT IN THE BOOK. NOT A BAD MOVIE, BUT NOT REALLY A WRINKLE IN TIME.","A Wrinkle in Time",3604,2.6,1.1

"3607",0.5,"  Terrible movie. Felt like a low budget spy kids combined with a poorly done baby geniuses movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3607,2.6,2.1
"3608",1.5,"  It was WAtchable but wasn't that much fun. could have been so much more. each scene only touched the surface of what the book described. it was criminally deficient.","A Wrinkle in Time",3608,2.6,1.1
"3609",4,"  A little daRk but a great movie for the kids","A Wrinkle in Time",3609,2.6,-1.4
"3610",0.5,"  Would have been much Better if it followed the book more closely","A Wrinkle in Time",3610,2.6,2.1
"3611",5,"  First and foremost, this is a movie made from a book with kids in mind. There's nothing wrong with that, and that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy the movie too. In a time where we're jam packed with movies and a world filled with explosions, war, death, and bullying, this movie is a heartfelt, comforting hug to anyone who has ever been on the recieving end of unkindess. Either from others or from our own demons. This is an excellent movie for anyone, young and old, in need of a reminder that it's our choices, not our emotions, that define who we are, and that it's never too late to be the best possible version of ourselves. Faults and all.","A Wrinkle in Time",3611,2.6,-2.4
"3612",0.5,"  I probably should have just kept the memory of the book and not gone to the movie. horrible acting, casting and directing. Total disaster. Beyond disappointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3612,2.6,2.1
"3613",1,"  Poor acting, extremely cheesy and predictable script, music was not appropriate for the scenes, and just over all confusing and POINTLESS plot:)","A Wrinkle in Time",3613,2.6,1.6
"3614",0.5,"  Taking Christianity out of a movie that was supposed to have it in proved to be a mistake!","A Wrinkle in Time",3614,2.6,2.1
"3615",2,"  went with 11 yr. old daughter. she said it was ok but a bit scattered. i almost fell ASLEEP multiple times. proceed with caution.","A Wrinkle in Time",3615,2.6,0.6
"3616",3.5,"  Very emotionally warm movie, really good inspiration. It's not really for adults but I really enjoyed watching it with my daughters. I was really touched by the father daughter scenes. Not as bad as these dumb 1.5 star reviews. If you have young daughters go see it with them.","A Wrinkle in Time",3616,2.6,-0.9
"3617",0.5,"  The most boring movie i have ever seen, the script is bad, screenplay is terrible, the acting was dead, make up was traumatisimg... do not waste your money on THIs ?????","A Wrinkle in Time",3617,2.6,2.1
"3618",0.5,"  Movie failed to follow the book and the first halF made no sense!","A Wrinkle in Time",3618,2.6,2.1
"3619",0.5,"  PROBABLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. FLAT, DULL CHARACTERS, IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PLOT LINE, UNINTERESTING SPECIAL EFFECTS. A COMPLETE WASTE OF A MOVIE.","A Wrinkle in Time",3619,2.6,2.1
"3620",0.5,"  Is as bad as the zodiac killer. B-o-r-I-n-g!!!!","A Wrinkle in Time",3620,2.6,2.1
"3621",5,"  It wasn't the book, but it was still effective and very artfully done. the acting was amazing, especially from the child characters. it was clear that a lot of heart went into this film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3621,2.6,-2.4
"3622",4,"  this movie made me cry. It started out really slow which made me question my decision of paying extra money for a sneakshow. the fairies just show up out of nowhere to help the family, and the way they travel through dimension was just so easy like everyone can just have superpower whenever they want. So I can see Why it might not appeal to a big chunk of audience because of this. the music blends in nicely with the emotions of the character. The emotional scenes force me not to take eyes off the screen for the second half of the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3622,2.6,-1.4
"3623",0.5,"  Absolutely terribleThe amount of CGI used is astounding. It is so far from the book it's painful to watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3623,2.6,2.1
"3624",4,"  It was visually stunning and I like the story.","A Wrinkle in Time",3624,2.6,-1.4
"3625",5,"  They stayed true to the book. It's a DIFFICULT concept to protra, so They did an absolutely amazing job. It is meant to be strange and colorful. It was a kId's book! Great job! I hope we get to see another from the series made on the big screen.","A Wrinkle in Time",3625,2.6,-2.4
"3626",5,"  VERY GLAD I DID ""NOT"" PAY ATTention TO THE NEGAtive Reviews!!! I TOOK MY 9 YEAR OLD DAughter TO see, AS PRomised, AND WE BOTH BELIEved IT WAs BEAutiful AND INSPIRAtional - oN MANY levels. A FEEL GOOD MOVIE WITH GREAT LIFE LESSONS FOR YOUNG & OLD ALIKE.","A Wrinkle in Time",3626,2.6,-2.4
"3627",5,"  wonderful movie with meaningful messages about love and life. great acting from all. I never read the book so can only go by what the movie delivered. I Am happy we saw it and even more happy our young children were moved by it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3627,2.6,-2.4
"3628",1.5,"  Some of the cringiest performances I've ever seen in a movie. All from actors who have shown in other films they can act. The blame then, unfortunately, seems to fall on the writer, director, and editor. The costume design is beutiful but in some scenes it becomes obvious that it was decided on with out much consideration with what the actors would actually be doing in the film.","A Wrinkle in Time",3628,2.6,1.1
"3629",1,"  ""A WRINKLE in time"" is What you get when you cross ""Fried green tomatoes"" with ""Alice in wonderland"". The cast never had a chance. A sad train wreck results when the story attempts to place a girl-talk narrative inside of a disturbing dream, with the added complication that it all happens in outer space somewhere. It felt like i started watching one movie, bought some popcorn, and came back into the wrong THEATER. Spare yourself the head scratching and scratch this one off the to-do list. A colossal waste of time, and too bad for the hard working actors, nobody could have made this mess of a screenplay work.","A Wrinkle in Time",3629,2.6,1.6
"3630",2.5,"  Parts of this movie are visually dazzling, other parts are predictably sentimental, but it's dreadfully slow (to the point of closing my eyes to sleep). I loved the original book, but not this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3630,2.6,0.1
"3631",0.5,"  Disney should pay me for having to sit through that horrific movie. Movie was Boring, not Funny and horribly casted. My wife and kids were so DISAPPOINTED after loving tHe book. Save your money and time - dont go!","A Wrinkle in Time",3631,2.6,2.1
"3632",1.5,NA,"A Wrinkle in Time",3632,2.6,1.1
"3633",2,"  aside from the great visuals the movie is rushed and too much of the book that made this classic story whole was cut from the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3633,2.6,0.6
"3634",1,"  This Is an absolutely terrible movie. The director says she doesnt care if people dont like it, or dont see it. Listen. To. Her. Dont waste your time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3634,2.6,1.6
"3635",3,"  I read the book as a child and loved it. I read it again recently with my 10-year-old girl and was put off by the pervasive Christian message. The underlying messaging reminded me in many ways of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis does. The movie does away with the Christian undertones, replacing them with a more subtle new age spirituality. While it still seemed a little hokey, I liked it better than the book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3635,2.6,-0.4
"3636",2,"  Nice story but was actually boring. I would mot watch again.","A Wrinkle in Time",3636,2.6,0.6
"3637",2,"  This movie was not a total waste of money, but very disappointing! most of the previews, werent even in the movie. Ophah was blah, resse was annoying. It statrs off boRing and never picks up.","A Wrinkle in Time",3637,2.6,0.6
"3638",1,"  They missed the aspects of the book that explain what's going on. VERY boring and hard to follow. I don't recommend watching.","A Wrinkle in Time",3638,2.6,1.6
"3639",2.5,"  could have been better.","A Wrinkle in Time",3639,2.6,0.1

"3641",5,"  having read the book many times, i loved this adaptation. tells the story in a great way. I really liked it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3641,2.6,-2.4
"3642",1.5,"  The performances are uniformly awful, and they're not helped by claustrophobic overuse of close-ups, an appalling score, and a script that replaces psychological and christian insights with oprah-esque self-help platitudes. Please read the book instead.","A Wrinkle in Time",3642,2.6,1.1
"3643",1.5,"  The trailers really hype this movie up. The book was great. Bothe myself and the three 11 year old girls I went with, were grossly disappointed. It could and should have been so much more!I felt that they put so much into the special effects but failed to connect to the excitement and depth to the story itself. If they decide to do a sequel, i won't be seeing it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3643,2.6,1.1
"3644",1,"  A true case of bad casting. Oprah can't pull off ethereal and mysterious no matter how much sparkly make up they put on her. every time she appeared on screen, it took me out of the movie. They've also turned a book with an essentially christian message into one with banal, new age, oprah-ized blather. someone needs to re-do this wonderful story and do it right. kids might like it if they don't know any better and don't know what it's supposed to be. At least they preserved the central message of love's power to save but i was very disappointed. A movie should make you forget that the characters are actors and this movie failed to do that.","A Wrinkle in Time",3644,2.6,1.6
"3645",0.5,"  Horrible! had to watch, really, and so sad. some wonderful actors who universally do poor jobs. don't waste your time ... don't even wait for it to watch at home. skip altogether!","A Wrinkle in Time",3645,2.6,2.1
"3646",1,"  The movie was very very bland.","A Wrinkle in Time",3646,2.6,1.6
"3647",0.5,"  This is a boring movie. Hard to watch. Feel like I wasted my money.","A Wrinkle in Time",3647,2.6,2.1
"3648",3,"  I Saw this MoVie yesterday in the theatre. I was very excited going into this movie with big hopes, as being a huge fan of the book. I was Less then impressed. The movie was not neccisarLy bad, In fact it was vIsually gorgeous, but the script just fell Flat. I dont know what it was that didnt Light that movie spark, but i just wasnt into it super much. Enjoyed it, but would definetly not see agAin.","A Wrinkle in Time",3648,2.6,-0.4
"3649",5,"  its the best movie that could ever by made of this particular book - one that blew my mind at age 14. in our forties now, the friends that I went with had mostly read the book and we loved it and were choked up by several scenes. friends that hadn't read the book weren't feeling it, though, so it may not work without the context.","A Wrinkle in Time",3649,2.6,-2.4
"3650",4,"  I thought this was a really good film. The visuals were spectacular. i think the casting was perfect. I had no issues with the Pace or what Some have reFerred to as the ease with which meg saves the day. I didnt come away agreeing with any of those criTicisms i had read in REVIEWS. The story is incredibly powerful and thouGht provoking. Most of the reviews inhave read seem to not be reviewing the film from the persoective of a Childrens targeted sci Fi movie. My 9 and 2 year olds thouroughly enjoyed aS did i and the wife.","A Wrinkle in Time",3650,2.6,-1.4
"3651",0.5,"  Some people saw a movie. All I saw was Oprah's ego. Nice way to ruin a book. Don't waste your time or money. Go see black panther instead.","A Wrinkle in Time",3651,2.6,2.1
"3652",0.5,"  Wow, so RT is forcing all caps in their review window? Can't seem to turn it off, sorry. Really liked the book, not sure what Disney is trying to do lately. I guess they are into trashing existing properties now? They were doing so incredibly well.","A Wrinkle in Time",3652,2.6,2.1

"3655",1,"  WHAT WERE THEY thinking??? never mind that they made some fundamental changes to a classic book (ok, if you do it right), it's just a visual mess. we're supposed to be drawn in by oprah with overdone make-up and saying ""be a warrior."" the terrible tv version was better than this.","A Wrinkle in Time",3655,2.6,1.6
"3656",1.5,"  They really did a good job on Diversity but over not good. Lots of plot stripped.","A Wrinkle in Time",3656,2.6,1.1

"3668",2.5,"  Took my daughters today and it was so-so. It lacked the feeling of the book and a lot of the script choices were odd. I am not sure why they played up the meg/calvin relationship and that was not ""it"". Also, it in no way captured the feeling of real children or families. came off as an after school special that reminded me of wrinkle in time. dissapointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3668,2.6,0.1

I'll definitely be buying a Wrinkle in time when it comes out on dvd!","A Wrinkle in Time",3671,2.6,2.1

"3677",3.5,"  ACCORDING TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER, THERE WERE FAR TOO MANY ""DUMB SAPPY MOMENTS."" IT ALSO STARTED OUT SLOW AND TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE ADVENTURE. IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK.

"3678",3,"  We took our two girls, ages 3 and 6, to see this. it was a bit over the 3-y.o.'s head but our 6 y.o. enjoyed most of it. the moral is a bit complex and we would it a bit slow to get started. the acting (mostly of the ""the Mrs'"", was mediocre and left us feeling like we were missing something. It was entertaining to see this classic on screen and overall, we enjoyed it. definitely a few misses though.","A Wrinkle in Time",3678,2.6,-0.4

"3682",1,"  We just got back from this film and I have to say I really wanted to like it. Having read the books with my boys and loving that experience, i thought this would be a surefire hit with me. It was not. Disney and Director ava duvernay seemed to want to focus more on diversity and political correctness as opposed to the source material. I just really wish hollywood would get back to making films for the sake of entertainment.","A Wrinkle in Time",3682,2.6,1.6
"3683",5,"  Great Movie! Visually stunning with a great message, especially for young people. Loved it!","A Wrinkle in Time",3683,2.6,-2.4
"3684",5,"  Despite the biased criticism, I chose to see this MOVIE. This movie makes You think and feel. Then QUESTIONs why you are feeling what you feel. It propels you to take self inventory. Forcing you to unapologetically admit your flaws. Understanding, the very things that flaws your canvas, can be the catalyst used to aid your conquest in conquering your ""It."" If you can eat the meat and throw away the bones, you'll extract a valuable jewel, ""Love conquers all.""","A Wrinkle in Time",3684,2.6,-2.4
"3685",1,"  tHE PREVIEWS FOR THIS MOVIE WAS ONLY oPRAH AND THE DIRECTOR AND THE CAST TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT THE MOVIE WAS. iT REALLY NEVER SHOWED ANY PARTS OF THE MOVIE. I THINK THEY KNEW HOW BAD THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE RECIEVED. I THINK THIS WILL LET SOME OF THE AIR OUT OF oPRAH. tHE PUBLIC KNOWS WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS BAD. iN THIS CASE THE MOVIE HAD NO REAL DIRECTION. tHE COSTUMES AND MAKE-UP WERE OVER THE TOP. iT WAS A DISTRACTION TO SAY THE LEAST. tHE ACTING WAS NOT EFFECTIVE. yOU GOT THE SENSE THAT EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE WAS ADRIFT...LOST. tHIS DIRECTOR DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. mAKING A MOVIE TO ONLY SATISFY YOUR POLITICAL AGENDA AND THEN ANNOUNCE TO THE PUBLIC IT DOES NOT MATTER IF IT MAKES MONEY...WELL THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH Disney AND ITS STOCK HOLDERS WILL BE GREATLY AFFECTED. I WONDER HOW MUCH MONEY OPRAH HAD IN THE PROJECT.? tHE MOVIE WAS BAD. nO GETTING AROUND THAT. I HEARD MORE GROANS AND SAW MORE PEOPLE WALK OUT OF THIS MOVIE THAN I HAVE SEEN SINCE THE TWILIGHT FILMS. tHIS MOVIE STINKS. won't BE THE FIRST AND WON'T BE THE LAST.","A Wrinkle in Time",3685,2.6,1.6

"3687",0.5,"  SO VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS FILM. BETWEEN BAD SOUND, confusing STORY TELLING, AND EITHER, OVER OR UNDER ACTING BY PRETTY MUCH EVERY CHARACTER, ALONG WITH LOOOOONG AND OVER-EMOTIONAL INTERLUDES THAT DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING TO THE STORY, we and our audience, kids included, were bored and let down by this soap-opera like movie, that potentially could have been great..","A Wrinkle in Time",3687,2.6,2.1

"3689",4.5,"  Our whole family liked it (girls age 9 and 12, as well as mom and dad). I enjoyed the lighting and color in the film. I thought the casting was good. I found Oprah's larger-than-life-character interesting. No complaints.","A Wrinkle in Time",3689,2.6,-1.9
"3690",5,"  i ENJOYED THE MOVIE THAN BLACK PANTHER. PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM A FAN OF THE BOOK AND AUTHOR, AND AM NOT A FAN OF THE mARVEL STORYLINES AND FILMS. MY GUESS IS THAT THOSE WHO CRITICISED THE MOVIE HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK OR COULD APPRECIATE THE PLOT. INSTEAD, THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM WERE EXPECTING AN ACTION-PACKED THRILLER, BUT INSTEAD, FOUND THEMSELVES WATCHING A TOUCHING STORY ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL FINALLY ACCEPTING HER IMAGE.","A Wrinkle in Time",3690,2.6,-2.4
"3691",1,"  Long story short...funny, I wish it was! No effort acting, poorly directed (did she even read the book?!) and LOOOONNNGGG. A dumpster fire through and through...","A Wrinkle in Time",3691,2.6,1.6
"3692",3.5,"  This Movie was, for me, a beautiful tribute to the book. As a child, the book was a sci-fi thriller that highlighted the strngth of children, the bond between sibLings, aNd the longing For parental love & attention. The young actors were mesmerizing. The actor playing Charles wallace was adorable as the Young genius who Adores his siSter and quite scary as the it-influenced villan! The casting was superb although oprah didnt seem to disappear into the role of mrs. Which as much as mrs. Which became oprah. The other flaw was the Far too quick redemption of charles wallace when Meg's love pulls him back from the brink. That said, this book is a Breath-takIng view of child imagination and wonder. SOmething we could all do well to focus on a little more these days.","A Wrinkle in Time",3692,2.6,-0.9
"3693",0.5,"  It honesTly was one of the most boring movie ive ever seen. Not worth tHe time to watch.","A Wrinkle in Time",3693,2.6,2.1
"3694",1,"  A horrible and confusing movie. Your kids will constantly ask what is happening. I only watched it because it was a double feature at the drive in.","A Wrinkle in Time",3694,2.6,1.6
"3695",1,"  Could have bee much better if they were try to b so POLITICALLY CORRECT.","A Wrinkle in Time",3695,2.6,1.6
"3696",2,"  yeah not impressed. And oprah was really bad in this. Her acting sucked and the metallic makeup and goofy costuming was ridiculous. This one isn't worth your money","A Wrinkle in Time",3696,2.6,0.6
"3697",0.5,"  It's hard to imagine this movie could have been any worse. I must admit, after 35 minutes I walked out. The writing was horrid and the the directing equally bad. The sound design was flattened and the story was all tell and no show. IT's the sort of kids film that expects children to need everything hand fed to them. It treats this like an opportunity to teach kids the values of love conquering all. It's the sort of thing that shows how little adults sometimes know how to speak to children.","A Wrinkle in Time",3697,2.6,2.1
"3698",4,"  This was an excellent children's film. I'm seeing a lot of hate thrown its way for that fact, but that's what the book was, a children's book, and that's what the film is, as well. If you still have a bit of your younger self in you, then let them out to play, and you'll enjoy this film. It's not super complicated, but it's beautiful, and its simplicity is refreshing and fun if you let it be. the leads, storm reid, levi miller, and deric mccabe, all gave excellent performances. The supporting staff mostly did well, though there were a few issues there. But overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend going to see it. especially if you have children, and even moreso if you have a daughter or daughters. bring them! this film will almost certainly become one of their favorites.","A Wrinkle in Time",3698,2.6,-1.4
"3699",4,"  I must respectfully disagree with my husband. This movie was AMAZING. It is my opinion that this movie is for the unaccepted. The ones who feel alone and have *almost* allowed darkness to take over their light.No movie is perfect and yet, just as the main character Meg discovers, there is beauty and power in one's faults...I personally feel that it is just as powerful as Black Panther, but on different scale.Storm,Oprah, Ava...job well done.","A Wrinkle in Time",3699,2.6,-1.4
"3700",1,"  Completely different from the original L'Engle story . Not good in any way.","A Wrinkle in Time",3700,2.6,1.6
"3701",2.5,"  This movie is for kids.","A Wrinkle in Time",3701,2.6,0.1
"3702",5,"  I REALLY liked it! Is it the same as the book? No, of Course not. Are there some things I wish they had included? Absolutely. But, go see it! do Not expect the director to have imagined the story the way you did as a child. It's different, but good! I loved the diverse cast, the contemporary settings - it all worked. and in the end, it is about an incredible young girl finding her strength.","A Wrinkle in Time",3702,2.6,-2.4
"3703",1,"  Save your money and don't waste it on this move. This is the first disney movie that i did not like.Hard to follow. because of such Simple plot and lack of story line; the scenes are dragged too long to fill the time. Graphics are amazing but these days this is not an accomplishment. Story line misses pieces and parts and you keep saying what happened to the brother, boyfriend, Father and etc. Quite frankly it jumps form one scene to another with no logical RELATIVITY. I actually heard the guy behind my saying ""Was everyone on acid when making the film?""Wait for it to become available online or DVD so you can fast forward without filling guilty that you paid 20 Bucks for it and have see it to the end","A Wrinkle in Time",3703,2.6,1.6
"3704",0.5,"  I think Ms. L'engle would like this adaptation even less than she did the 2003 one. I hated it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3704,2.6,2.1
"3705",5,"  i am going to preface this review by saying i have not read the book. I enjoyed this movie very much. However i do not believe this movie would bE appropriate for young children.","A Wrinkle in Time",3705,2.6,-2.4
"3706",1,"  Movie was terrible. I will never get the hour and a 1/2 of my life back, I left the theater angry that I spent the money, save the money and time,","A Wrinkle in Time",3706,2.6,1.6
"3707",2,"  Poorly executed. Lacked heart and feLl flat.","A Wrinkle in Time",3707,2.6,0.6
"3708",0.5,"  Because it had Oprah, Disney probably thought it would be a blockbuster, not! more like a bomb. big waste of time and money to see this.","A Wrinkle in Time",3708,2.6,2.1
"3709",0.5,"  This movie is terrible. Lots of CGI but each scene is so random and lackin in purpose. The kis find their lost father with no trouble at all. The father leaves his kids in an evil place because he's scared? This movie makes no sense. The director needs to start over. IT is such a waste of time for the Family. Unfortunately it is overhyped it will probably make a lot of money and then be quickly forgotten.","A Wrinkle in Time",3709,2.6,2.1
"3710",4,"  I really liked the movie, interesting story lines and important messages about life and courage. visually stunning!","A Wrinkle in Time",3710,2.6,-1.4
"3711",1,"  Not a good movie at all.","A Wrinkle in Time",3711,2.6,1.6
"3712",2,"  The effects were good, but the writing was over the top cheesie. I was disappointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3712,2.6,0.6
"3713",2,"  Such a visual spectacle with parts that will keep you warm. But it sadly misses the mark when it comes to STORYTELLING.","A Wrinkle in Time",3713,2.6,0.6
"3714",1.5,"  ONe word: YUCK. This movies proves 3 things: 1. not all disney is great; 2. not all all-star cast movies are great, and; 3. it matters how the pieces of the movie is edited.","A Wrinkle in Time",3714,2.6,1.1
"3715",1,"  Most disappointed. beautiful cast, vibrant or potentially vibrant story fell short. seemed stale before act one was finished. i was never sure what i was watching or what i was waiting for to happen. the act structure was weak. sure was hoping for a home run. i don't even want to waste a good tomato on this one. god please don't let them screw up frozen 2. if they can keep from stealing other people's plot lines, it should be good.","A Wrinkle in Time",3715,2.6,1.6
"3716",2.5,"  DISAPPOINTED. Loved the costumes, cast and some of the scenes with special graphics. SAW it in 3D so the Parts that were animated were fun to watch but the movie is nothing like the book - nothing LIKE it. They took an amazing book and destroyed it on SCREEn. They left out parts, changed characters and sort of morphed the message. If you didn't read the book, you may not actually understand it but if you did read the book, you may be confused because it is LACKIng.This movie is getting major publicity because of Oprah. I feel like it's AN attempt to keep her RELEVANT. The actress who plays the main character is a Disney channel familiar face whos talent is over rates and again, another change because in the book the main character is Completely different both in appearance and personality.It's not worth your money to see in the theater. Wait until it comes out on Netflix or redbox.","A Wrinkle in Time",3716,2.6,0.1
"3717",5,"  Great color. Beautiful emotion. Brought to 2018 with style. Perfect family movie. Recommended!","A Wrinkle in Time",3717,2.6,-2.4
"3718",1,"  Beautiful visuals. Terrible story.","A Wrinkle in Time",3718,2.6,1.6
"3719",4,"  I grew up on the books, to see some it on the big screen was kinda fun","A Wrinkle in Time",3719,2.6,-1.4
"3720",2,"  THOUGH THE STORY LINE WAS INTERESTING, IT WAS NOT ORIGINAL. THE EFFECTS WERE PRETTY GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. AND IT WAS A BIT TOO FLUFFY","A Wrinkle in Time",3720,2.6,0.6
"3721",5,"  It''s a WELL done movie with a lesson of life and the best performance of Reese Witherspoon ever she alone should get a nomination for this movie","A Wrinkle in Time",3721,2.6,-2.4

"3726",5,"  amazing movie, i loved it. However, I feel like if you haven't read the book or understand physics, a lot of the subtle beauty of the movie will be lost on you. don't hate something just because you don't understand it :)","A Wrinkle in Time",3726,2.6,-2.4
"3727",5,"  I absolutely loved the movie! My young nieces enjoyed it as well. I'll be going back to see it again this weekend.","A Wrinkle in Time",3727,2.6,-2.4
"3728",0.5,"  The diversity of the cast or the modernization of the home were not an issue for me. I don't really care if characters don't look the way they are described in a book. What I did hate was the pace of the movie and the lack of depth to any of the characters. Everything moves quickly, characters are introduced clumsily and nothing about what makes each character special ever feels believable. The CGI is plentiful yet cheesy. My 5 year old wanted to leave halfway through, my 12 year old practically feel asleep and both us adults were disappointed so I'm not sure what age group this movie was targeted for but it missed the mark. 103 million spent on costume and CGI","A Wrinkle in Time",3728,2.6,2.1
"3729",0.5,"  Not sure the movie makers even read the book as The lackluster script has little resemblance to the ample material it provided. And whats going on with all the glitter and rhinestones! Apparently the twins were irrelevant as were most of the thoughtful details of madeleine d'engle's work.","A Wrinkle in Time",3729,2.6,2.1
"3730",5,"  iT WAS a great family movie. My kids enjoyed it and so did I.","A Wrinkle in Time",3730,2.6,-2.4
"3731",4,"  a Wonderfully cast adaptation of a great book. i really enjoyed seeing the characters brought to life. i take off one star because i think some of the situations or characters could be CONFUSING for someone who hadn't read the book already. But for wrinkle fans I think it's a must see.","A Wrinkle in Time",3731,2.6,-1.4
"3732",5,"  I don't know what movie some of these critics saw, but I thought Duvernay knocked this one out of the ballpark. The movie was fantastic, and I think it will become this century's ""Wizard of Oz.""","A Wrinkle in Time",3732,2.6,-2.4
"3733",3,"  It was interesting. That's all I could make of it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3733,2.6,-0.4
"3734",2,"  personally i think THAT this movie does not do the book justice. It has a wonderful cast and a great director but just couldn't conect with the audience very well. It is missing the spark that the book has that makes you feel for the characters. It is also trying to hard to appeal to this generation by making it more futuristic but overall losing the feeling the story was supposed to have.","A Wrinkle in Time",3734,2.6,0.6
"3735",1,"  Good visuals, good effects, nice soundtrack, good actors, even the kids are good. EVERYTHING else sucks. Bad pacing, CONVOLUTED direction, boring and over the top at the same time, terrible camera angles, some of the worst. Why is every shot two inches from the actors face in every shot? 4/10 stars from me.","A Wrinkle in Time",3735,2.6,1.6
"3736",2,"  I just hope Our kids had a good time.","A Wrinkle in Time",3736,2.6,0.6

"3738",4,"  I went with my daughter. When we got iut if the movie she said she wanted to be a better sister. Wins in my book other than that the story is kindA all over the place.","A Wrinkle in Time",3738,2.6,-1.4
"3739",3,"  The quintessential oprah message about conquering your inner demons, loving and believing in yourself and others. In many ways like a modern wizard of oz. Visually appealing and a positive message kept simple for the target audience, primarily preteen girls.","A Wrinkle in Time",3739,2.6,-0.4
"3740",1,"  Do not waste your money or time!!! Worst movie in the last 20 years I have Seen.","A Wrinkle in Time",3740,2.6,1.6
"3741",1,"  This movie is lost in space about being lost in space!","A Wrinkle in Time",3741,2.6,1.6
"3742",1,"  It makes No sense and is a bad movie in general. 10/10 reccomond you stay at home and spend your money on SoMeThing better","A Wrinkle in Time",3742,2.6,1.6
"3743",4,"  While I feel that a lot of the more scientific elements of the book were dropped to make it more digestible for a general audience, overall it was a good film. I loved the characters; they were all well developed. And the visuals were just amazing.","A Wrinkle in Time",3743,2.6,-1.4
"3744",5,"  I thought the movie was a good family movie...","A Wrinkle in Time",3744,2.6,-2.4
"3745",4.5,"  MY daughter is 10. I believe she is the target audience of Disney's reimagined version of the book. She has not read the book yet. So, from her point of view, this movie was fantastical, beautiful and FULL of truth. It gives a physical form to the negativity in the world which helped her understand the concepts being explained. She loved watching a movie where the main character is female and close to her age, and Seeing a family With an adopted member, because she is adopted. After it was over she immediately wanted to watch it again.I gave it a 4 1/2 because she loved it SO much, but for me there were a few parts that seemed to drag out to long and I have read the BOOK. Also, I thought, the part of Calvin needed a little bit more explanation instead of him just showing up in front of Mrs. Who's house to meet Meg and Charles Wallace.","A Wrinkle in Time",3745,2.6,-1.9
"3746",3,"  Went to go see it for my daughter's birthday, & I had let her read my copy of the story beforehand, she asked me why it was too Disney & not exactly like the book...... So she liked it but didn't love it...... It's a good family movie for anyone who hasn't read the story yet...... I wouldn't see it again at the theatre, but if it comes on TV I'll see again......","A Wrinkle in Time",3746,2.6,-0.4
"3747",0.5,"  ThiS was one of the worst movies ive ever Seen. There was multiple people that walked out of the movie not even an hour into it. A complete waste of time and it was so bad that it was tRuly laughable at times. I would highly not recommend this movie to anyone. Save your cash or watch something else. Whoever gave this movie the go Ahead should be fired IMMEDIATELY and banned forever. I would give this a rating of negative five stars but its not an option. Its so bad that it makes you feel uncomfortable. If i havent Convinced you of how bad this movie sucks, go waste two hours of your life and find out.","A Wrinkle in Time",3747,2.6,2.1
"3748",3,"  Visually Stunning. Hair, make up, costumes were all amazing. The story just comes across as meh. Great message but i feel like big chunks of the movie was missing. Also why is the brother and the guy friend even there? they add ABSOLUTELY nothing to the movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3748,2.6,-0.4
"3749",0.5,"  The most borring film ever.","A Wrinkle in Time",3749,2.6,2.1
"3750",5,"  EVERY CLIP I'VE SEEN IS WONDERFULLY EXECUTED AND THE DIRECTORS CREATED A PHENOMENAL Adaptation, even more gorgeous that the original screenplay. I especially enjoyed seeing this portrayal where more characters are poc, as i thought that tied into my personal experience very nicely.","A Wrinkle in Time",3750,2.6,-2.4

"3754",1,"  Worst movie disney has ever made! Slow, confusing, dumb! Not even worth a $3.99 rental. I want the 2 hours of my life back, and my 40 bucks!","A Wrinkle in Time",3754,2.6,1.6

"3758",0.5,"  The only age this may appeal to is young children or tweens...maybe. This is not a movie for all ages. The tone in the theater was so odd as ppl were laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be laughed at. We were clearly not the target demo. Older book readers will be throughly disappointed. It's the one time I've considered walking out. Save your money or see Black Panther instead.","A Wrinkle in Time",3758,2.6,2.1
"3759",1,"  I don't review movies, but I was so disappointed and upset with the amount of time this movie stole from me. the character development was poor at best. i felt no connection to any of them, nor did i feel the characters connected to each other. the visual effects were beautiful, but felt like they were there just to be there, not because it meant anything. horrible movie!","A Wrinkle in Time",3759,2.6,1.6

"3768",1,"  the imagery in this movie was by far the best thing going for it. It was all over the place. The message was confusing. The acting was mediocre. I did not like it. Not to mention it dragged on and on. It was truly about 25 minutes too long.","A Wrinkle in Time",3768,2.6,1.6
"3769",5,"  I thouGht the movie was amazing. I was not eXpecting it to be so emotional. It takes you on a journey of sElf AcceptancE. It was tailored to young adults but i eNjoyEd it.

"3777",4,"  Enjoyed it, have been waiting for years for an adaptation.","A Wrinkle in Time",3777,2.6,-1.4
"3778",2,"  Dissapointing. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" suffers from a lot of flaws. To be honest, I'm surprised the script got passed by the producers. It's weird but the exhibition in this film is either too much or not enough, so I was at either ""I get it, move on!"" or ""Wait, what!? Explain!."" The dialogue among the humans just doesn't sound like how regular human beings speak. It doesn't help that the kids who play the three main characters aren't good actors. The two boys in particular are wanting. Between the acting and the dialogue, the love interest kid is a wedged-in, purposeless dummy, and the super-intelligent younger brother is obnoxiously precocious and a bit hard to understand sometimes.The film does have some strong parts. All the big name actors who play the alien beings did a great job. In fact, this was probably my favorite performance by Reece Witherspoon as a weird, unintentionally rude alien. Visually, the effects, the costumes, and sets are all a joy to watch. Lot of creativity there.In fact, I liked the second act. The focus on the aliens and other planets are when things got good. Unfortunately, the third act focuses on the human characters again and falls into the mistakes of the drawn-out first act.Kids may enjoy the visuals here, but If you're a parent be prepared to be bored for part of this.","A Wrinkle in Time",3778,2.6,0.6

"3781",0.5,"  I loved this book (and trilogy) as a child and thought I would take my kids to see it. It reminded me of a bad Nickelodeon TV show. EVen with the big budget effect. Some of which were good. Winfrey is just goofy and it was not true to the original feeling of the book, at all. I sort of suspected that but went with an open mind. Popcorn was good.","A Wrinkle in Time",3781,2.6,2.1
"3782",2.5,"  Great cast. Good visuals. Poor storytelling.Major plotlines left in the dust. Character introductions are at a minimum. People unfamiliar with the book will be lost. Fans of the book will be upset.*spoilers*no twins Whatsit's transformation is not right No backstory is given as to the fact that the Mrs. were stars. You think they're going to do it, but they literally fall short.Aunt Beast is a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment. They should have just cut it altogether. The ""It"" planet is hardly recognizable. The beige neighborhood exists for about 2 minutes, before everything literally changes. The city is now a beach.The characters go from Earth to their first alien world, to Happy Medium, to Camazots, back to Earth. That's it.This movie could have used at least another half hour of story, and the it might have been good.","A Wrinkle in Time",3782,2.6,0.1
"3783",1,"  painfully Terrible movie. Terrible story, terrible directing, terrible editing, terrible acting, even the soundtrack was terrible. I don't know what they were thinking. The whole movie was silly and sappy and bluntly manipulative, kind of like Spielberg's horrible ""Hook"" but much worse. The critics were being inexplicably kind to give it as high a rating as they did.","A Wrinkle in Time",3783,2.6,1.6

"3785",1.5,"  The visuals, while often quite imaginative seemed at the same time stale and extravagant. Most all the scenes lacked drama and direction and the only clear element was the consistent, indicative insistence on the film's themes of love and self acceptance. A great premise with great themes, but ultimately an aimless missed opportunity.","A Wrinkle in Time",3785,2.6,1.1

"3788",5,"  I Thought this was an ABSOLUTELY beautIful aNd EMPOWERING movie. It was pure mAgic on the screen That covered such deep, powerful , important messages. I loved the book as a kid and i just lOved this movie. It was such a SPECIAL Experience to go with My 9 year old son who also loved it. I highly recOmmend seeing it (ignore the Negative REVIEWS and choose light).","A Wrinkle in Time",3788,2.6,-2.4

"3792",0.5,"  Another Disney bomb!""L'Engle calls A Wrinkle in Time her ""psalm of praise to God."" In Wrinkle, Jesus is made to look as if he is on the same level as Buddha and Gandhi. Charles Wallace, the main character in the book, asks the angel, ""Who have our fighters been?"" The angel quotes John 1:5, then Charles shouts out in response, ""Jesus! . . . The angel replies: ""Go on Charles, there were others. All your great artists... His friend Calvin then adds to the list, confidently calling out Gandhi and Buddha...Children reading L'Engle's fiction are getting her theology whether they want it or not. Placing Jesus' name along with Gandhi and Buddha was not a mistake.""","A Wrinkle in Time",3792,2.6,2.1

"3794",0.5,"  Total garbage. I can't believe i wasted my money on this film. My kids hated it, and we hated it. Who hired the talentless director who made this steaming pile of crap?","A Wrinkle in Time",3794,2.6,2.1
"3795",1,"  I don't even know what to say. Not for kids, not for adults; costumes and make up is not good; mysic not good; characters are not deep; hard to connect with anything about this movie. I was waiting to Really connect with the message and aonegow that got lost too. Very bummed as i wanted to love it. Sonebody pay a bonus to the editor that cut the trailer for doibg an excellent job of making this movie look great.","A Wrinkle in Time",3795,2.6,1.6

"3801",4,"  Great inspirationThis movie is great encouragement to go beyond limitations. It brought beautiful imagery. I would recommend it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3801,2.6,-1.4
"3802",5,"  Storm Reid captured the angry, awkward, unhappy brave Meg Murry better than anyone I could imagine. And this movie. It is so much about love between siblings. That agonizing, impossible, gut-level love. Calvin O'Keefe and Charles Wallace were perfectly cast. The Witches were modernized and younger than I'd imagined them for sure, but they were still glorious.There were a few issues with the book, which I won't mention because of spoilers. But the movie fixed them ALL and made the entire story so much stronger.Madeleine L'Engle would be proud, I am so so sure of it.Now: this movie has girl cooties all over it. PLEASE GO SEE IT IN THE THEATERS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I want us to show that movies for GIRLS (not women, necessarily, but GIRLS) are worth putting money and time into.","A Wrinkle in Time",3802,2.6,-2.4

"3804",3.5,"  This was my favorite pre-teen book and I read it again knowing the movie was coming out. I found the book to be clunky on my second reading but I could see why i loved it. The movie was clunky but in a different way from the book. I think that it just never achieved the great relationships that each character in the movie had with meg. and definitely did not show the true quirkiness of charles wallace. I wanted to love it, but I rate it better than okay.","A Wrinkle in Time",3804,2.6,-0.9

"3811",0.5,"  Varies far too much from the book. Doesnt have the cohesion of the book or purpose of being. So many elements.changed or eliminated that it is barely Recognizable as related to the book. If you enjoyed the book, Steer clear of the movie","A Wrinkle in Time",3811,2.6,2.1
"3812",1,"  If you have reaD the books, dont watch this movie! ItS horrib abd helf sovmuch out and added so much that the book dodnt have. This was a conplete heart break beamcause i had been waiting over 10 years for this movie! I live the books and could not wait to see the movie.

"3814",2.5,"  When I heard Ava was directing, I downloaded the audiobook and listened when I used to trek to work. I really couldn't get into the story, mainly because of the style of writing and the way the characters talked to each other. I never finished it. After seeing what I saw today I can only say that this particular story does not lend itself to adaptation easily. There are shots in this film that you'd see in an oscar nominated film which can only be created by Ava. But the surrounding story tries to drown it out. That being said, coming out of the theater I had the strongest desire to see a Wizard of Oz movie directed by Ava DuVernay. All of the elements and techniques were in this film to make the latter something special. Even keeping some of the same cast.I know this film was not for my particular demographic, and that it has a very important message weaved throughout. But a good movie needs a good script and when the book that script is based on is an acquired taste in itself, a universally loved product is a difficult goal.","A Wrinkle in Time",3814,2.6,0.1
"3815",5,"  This movie was absolutely beautiful. For those who have not read the book, you should, as the meaning of the movie will mean much more. I cried through the whole thing due to how powerful the message was. I want to commend Ava duvernay as this movie beautifully BEtrayed women of color and the courage to be oneself. Beautifully done.","A Wrinkle in Time",3815,2.6,-2.4
"3816",1,"  The only good thing about this movie was the source material. The acting, directing and overall story telling of this move was aweful and its also too scary for young children stay away","A Wrinkle in Time",3816,2.6,1.6
"3817",1.5,"  Feels like half a movie since Its all set up with no rEal pay off.","A Wrinkle in Time",3817,2.6,1.1
"3818",1,"  I was super excited to see this movie, but like everything hollywood does it falls short of being similar to the book. The best parts of the book were taken out to EMPHASIS UNINTERESTING aspects. if it wouldn't have been for my 5 year old poking me every few minutes to ask if we could go somewhere else I probably would have fallen asleep in the movie....","A Wrinkle in Time",3818,2.6,1.6
"3819",1,"  Not very well done. the story leave a lot to be desired. reese witherspoon was good in her part, but not much I cared for in this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3819,2.6,1.6
"3820",4.5,"  We really enjoyed this movie! Following Meg on her adventure through the universe to find her father and discover the power within herself was so fun. It was also a great reminder that our imperfections are a part of us and that we are worthy of RECEIVING and giving love. This is a great movie for parents to take the pre-teens and teens to see. If you want a discussion guide to use afterwards we have one up on our blog right now. The imagery was stunning and the characters were cast well! Yes, it was not exactly like the book- but I was not expecting it to be and I was not DISAPPOINTING. The theme of light and love shone through. We highly RECOMMEND this movie.","A Wrinkle in Time",3820,2.6,-1.9
"3821",1,"  as time passed I cared less and less about the characters and the plot. I finally stopped caring completely and left about 10 min. to go.","A Wrinkle in Time",3821,2.6,1.6
"3822",3.5,"  This film has attracted a lot of negative reviews, but I think folks are being Way too harsh. I enjoyed the movie, and I really liked the lead actress who played Meg Murry--hope to see more of her. I like the scoring too, which OCCASIONALLY mixed in standard orchestral fare with some light R&B tunes for a very fresh effect. My favorite scene involved the three kids stuck in an empty white room--and she uses some special lenses gifted to her to find a set of invisible stairs leading up to her trapped father. Graphically and musically a very Artfully done scene. Two things which I didn't like. I felt Mindy kaling was miscast, mainly because it's so hard for me to see her outside her typical comedy roles. But no real problem with her performance per se. Second is the way the three ""mrS"" were introduced. It was just too sudden, jarring and unconvincing. These are some really wierd people (by normal standards)--but they just appear out of nowhere and are fully accepted by the main cast so quickly! No questions asked! If any part of the movie makes it feel like a ""kids movie"", it's this weak early introductory sequence. But after that bumpy intro I did find myself getting immersed into the beautifully rendered worlds.","A Wrinkle in Time",3822,2.6,-0.9
"3823",1,"  The movie is slow to bUild, choppy anD quite dull in its character adapTation. Read the book instead.","A Wrinkle in Time",3823,2.6,1.6

"3825",0.5,"  I watched this movie entirely and i still don'T understand what happened. The acting from Levi Miller was trUly atrocious and the movie would have been fine without him. The only enjoyment i got from this movie was making fUn Of it.","A Wrinkle in Time",3825,2.6,2.1

"3828",2.5,"  way too much footage spent on cameos of the Pretty cast. not enough action, Acting was fine but the story became dull by way too many slow-moving cameo scenes. Would have like to seen more place traveled to. not good for children under 9. Costumes, make-up, & special effect nicely done good.","A Wrinkle in Time",3828,2.6,0.1

The visuals are stunning and the performances of the actors are superb, especially storm reid as me'g and reese witherspoon aS mrs. whatsiT. Dont buy into these cynical naysayers.

"3839",0.5,"  God awful. I do not recomend.","A Wrinkle in Time",3839,2.6,2.1
"3840",1.5,"  A really poor adaptation of the book, that also suffers from poor acting... I don't think the book is IMPOSSIBLE to make into a movie, but I feel like here they were not even trying to use the book as anything other than inspiration for a visually oriented movie where story was an afterthought.","A Wrinkle in Time",3840,2.6,1.1
"3841",2.5,"  Grade: C+Rating: PG, 1 hour 49 minutesIn a Nutshell: Despite its best intentions, A Wrinkle in Time is disappointing as a film, although kids will probably still like it.Based on the very popular book A Wrinkle in Time (Time Quintet) by Madeleine L'Engle , it doesn't quite deliver the magic I hoped for, especially since screenwriter Jennifer Lee had done such great work with Disney's Frozen , Zootopia (DVD) Wreck-It Ralph and even Frozen Fever. Tips for Parents:LOTS of moral lessons kids and parents can feel good about.Kids in perilMrs. Whatsit uses the word ""prodigious."" In case your kids ask you what it means, you can tell them ""remarkably or impressively great in extent, size, or degree."" Your kids will be so impressed that you know. BullyingNo profanity. Thank you!Multi-racial familyUplifting theme: The only way to defeat the darkness is to become the light.Love rescues""Be a warrior."" - Mrs. Which (Oprah)Center yourself. Become one with the universe and yourself.""The wound is the place where the light enters you."" - Mrs. WhoThings I liked:Chris Pine! I love him in anything.Storm Reid is adorable and did a pretty good job, although a bit straight-faced during most of the movie. Her best scene, by far, was with Chris Pine towards the end.It's a colorful ride. The gossiping flower scene was the best part of the film.Fun hairstyles on the Mrs.'s.Zach Galifinakus was pretty funny and did a lot with the very small role he was given.I think frequencies and energy are so interesting. If you're fascinated by science, check out A Wrinkle in Time Book of Fun, Facts, and Science Energy is everything.Some of the scenes were shot in gorgeous New Zealand.Things I didn't like:While director DuVernay was very enthusiastic and creative, her vision was probably overly ambitious, resulting in a choppy mess.A lot of the green screens look fake with some special effects that don't really work. Some weird moments with missing details. Sometimes I really wish directors would let me see their movies before they released them so that I could point out some of the mistakes that could be quickly fixed.Deric McCabe as Charles Wallace is super cute, but sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.I couldn't understand a word Storm Reid was saying during the tornado scene in the woods.Cliched scene where someone says, ""Do you trust me?""Mindy Kaling looked so awkward trying to run in her ridiculous dress. What was her character's purpose? She didn't actually do anything to help. Over-the-top make-up. The costumes were creative, but they looked like costumes.The ""Mrs's"" looked more fake than magical. You don't need to pay extra money to see this in IMAX. It's fine on the regular screen. Better yet, watch it when it comes out on Netflix.The dialogue may sound good in the book, but it's awkward in the movie.Lots of close-ups that don't really work.A scene in the second trailer was completely cut out of the movie.I actually looked at the clock on my cell phone. That's never a good sign.There's no real villain. There's only a wispy, menacing ""it."" Kids who haven't read the book might think that Oprah's character's name is Mrs. Witch. While Oprah really is bigger than life (I laughed when Mrs. Which was gigantic), her acting is not good. I heard her speak to a room full of 10,000 a number of years ago at the California Governor's Conference for Women and she was mesmerizing.Surprisingly, some of the acting was not good by quite a few of the other actors too. It felt forced and contrived.Interesting lines:""You can do this. You're choosing not to."" - Happy Medium (Zach Galifianakis)""It's ok to fear the answers, Meg, but you have to face them."" - Happy Medium""What if we are not just in the universe, but the universe is in us?"" - Mr. Murry (Chris Pine)""You just have to find the right frequency and have faith in who you are."" - Mrs. Which (Oprah)""We can't take credit for our talents. It's how we use them that counts."" - Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon)""Your house is so warm. You've done a good job keeping the darkness out."" - Mrs. Whatsit""Love is always there, even if you don't feel it. It's always there for you."" - Mr. Murry""Don't give up hope."" - Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)  @trinaboice","A Wrinkle in Time",3841,2.6,0.1
"3842",3,"  Too confusing, too preachy, too much focus on the Mrs. W's makeup and wardrobe and not enough attention to the basic story. I really wanted to like this. :(","A Wrinkle in Time",3842,2.6,-0.4
"3843",4.5,"  This movie was transporting. I suspect that most of the haters have either not recently read the book or never appreciated it in the first place. I re-read the book about two months ago and found it did not quite live up to how i had experienced it when i was a child. It was a book written for children and remains so. its themes are broad, but not well-developed. its language is utilitarian. it's still a very good story, but it's not the masterpiece i recall. the movie, on the other hand, was glorious in ways that i could not have imagined. Of course, it was different. that is necessary - and truly part of its beauty. A family living in a neighborhood in modern times with modern neighbors is more relatable than a remote house on the edge of the woods. Sure, I missed some of the details of the book (I really wanted to see Mrs. WhatsIt transform into the magical creature of the book, not so much a lettuce leaf--although the ""flying"" of the children was delightful--and I excepted a much more recognizable sky-skraping BUREAUCRACY in the central central intelligence), but there was so many inspired moments--the lure of the alternative self offered to meg during her battle, the purity of her love that saved charles wallace, the tender moments shared with meg and her father at the beginning, the wave to veronica at the end, and, i guess i am sucker for fashion, but the fantastic dresses of the mrses! i felt a much stronger emotional connection to the movie than i did upon my most recent read f the book, and i teared up through much of the movie (as did my husband and teenage daughter). for those critics who remain unmoved, i'm afraid the It has already taken hold.","A Wrinkle in Time",3843,2.6,-1.9
"3844",5,"  Absolutely loved it...not sure why all the haters","A Wrinkle in Time",3844,2.6,-2.4
"3845",2,"  All over the place and rushed. Some Very boring SCenes and the last few minutes were a drag. INITIALLY, seeing Oprah and Mindy made we want to see it but Their roles were not developed at all. The visuals were okay at some POINTS BUT relied too heavily on that and not the plot. No comedic values and no character attachments. Wont be watching again and children will be bored out of their minds.","A Wrinkle in Time",3845,2.6,0.6
"3846",0.5,"  Absolute trash. No regard for the source material combined with overbearing ""woke"" preachiness.","A Wrinkle in Time",3846,2.6,2.1
"3847",5,"  GRanted ive never read the book, so my review may be mis-aligned with long time fans, but i thought the film was a moving experience, both visually and spirtually. I love folms that can succes deliver a message, and i feel like it did so.","A Wrinkle in Time",3847,2.6,-2.4
"3848",1,"  POORLY written, POORLY acted, SAVE YOUR time and MONEY. PERHAPS the single WORSE FILM i have ever HAD the displeasure OF SEEING.","A Wrinkle in Time",3848,2.6,1.6
"3849",1.5,"  They changed so much It doesn't resemble anything from the book. A PC attempt that fails with serious character manipulation and under-development. I yawned most of the way through the awkward attempt at harnessing a classic. What a disappointment.","A Wrinkle in Time",3849,2.6,1.1
"3850",0.5,"  MOST DISAPPOINTING FILM. most amazing book.","A Wrinkle in Time",3850,2.6,2.1
"3851",1,"  I am not sure what I was expecting from this movie but needless to say at the end of the movie I was laughing because of how corny and cringey it was. Also, who the hell names their kid charles Wallace?","A Wrinkle in Time",3851,2.6,1.6
"3852",3.5,"  A wrinkle in tIme has likable characters,a great cast,stunning viduals and a meaningful story But the movie is oddly paced aNd is kinda stupid at times, overall its something kids can enjoy but adults probably wont","A Wrinkle in Time",3852,2.6,-0.9
"3853",3.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is visually stunning and brings about CHILDLIKE wonder. SUBTLE nuances to acceptance and inner strength provide a powerful message. The diversity portrayed on screen shows the world how it really looks. The young actors were incredible. It's not a perfect film, but it is a wonderful family FILM.","A Wrinkle in Time",3853,2.6,-0.9
"3854",2,"  i saw this last night. I found it choppy and boring. very disappointed.","A Wrinkle in Time",3854,2.6,0.6
"3855",0.5,"  STOP it. Get some help.","A Wrinkle in Time",3855,2.6,2.1
"3856",2,"  Very pretty, but without substance. I am confused why the pro critics thought this was interesting. Removing all the dialogue would have significantly improved the film, as the viewer could have made up an interesting explanation for the pretty pictures.","Annihilation",3856,3.8,1.8
"3857",3.5,"  A really good sci-fi flick, with a lot to think about. Lots of good visuals throughout and a solid performance from Natalie Portman","Annihilation",3857,3.8,0.3
"3858",2,"  The premise had potential. But in the end it was disappointing.","Annihilation",3858,3.8,1.8
"3859",1,"  Falsely complex. As a biologist, I understand what inspired the movie. But the delivery is flat.","Annihilation",3859,3.8,2.8
"3860",5,"  Annihilation is an alien movie like no other. Sci-fi and horror all rolled in to one that leaves you asking many questions and pondering our existence on this earth. Are we truly alone ?","Annihilation",3860,3.8,-1.2
"3861",1.5,"  The movie was nothing new. The story was standard and predictable. The concept was alright. There was nothing challenging about this movie. I am seriously doubting Netflix as a producer of movies.","Annihilation",3861,3.8,2.3
"3862",4.5,"  Annihilation is ambitious even for a sci-fi movie, it really challenges our believes on what is possible. Some peoples imagination might not stretch far enough but for me it really played in my mind and gave me a memorable feeling like nothing else, a feeling of the universe and what is and is not possible, we just don't know. Annihilation does a beautiful job at representing us with what the writer or the director thought could be possible and what an alien life form could end up being - strange and unlike anything we could imagine.","Annihilation",3862,3.8,-0.7
"3863",5,"  I do not care if I sound smart or not. I liked the fucked up idea behind it. I ADORED the all female swat team into the unknown. I loved the terrifyingly beautiful or the beautiful terrifying. Its great. Like, you'll enjoy it. Chill.","Annihilation",3863,3.8,-1.2
"3864",5,"  Whilst the movie chooses to switch up the order of events, change nuiances in the characters (The biggest being the psychologist), and some other minor details, the film adaptation takes all that is good within the book and adds a unique cinematic experience to it. The movie explains things that are more open ended in the book, and the book explains things that are more open ended in the movie with some parts painted with the same ominous brushstrokes which give each of them their unique identity. In this sense, It is unfair to compare and contrast them in terms of which is better, but only in ways which make them both uniquely brilliant. I was forced to try ti understand the implications of the story purely visually and emotionally. I've never had even the most profound movies cause me to completely deviate from words spoken, but Annihilation does this perfectly by the repitition of ""I don't know"", and the best movies leave with audiences uttering the same thing.","Annihilation",3864,3.8,-1.2
"3865",5,"  Pure sci - fi love it","Annihilation",3865,3.8,-1.2
"3866",3,"  Annihilation is the second Sci-Fi movie directed by Alex Garland after his great debut Ex-Machina. Unfortunately, this movie is not as good as Ex-Machina. It suffers from the lack of characters depth, terrible pacing, and a lot of things that left unexplained which I considered as plot holes. I struggled to care about everything that happen with the characters in this movie aside of the character portrayed by Natalie Portman. But, I really appreciate the fact that this movie is beautifully shot and the fact that this movie is trying to be different than your ordinary Sci-Fi movie. This is definitely one of those movies that you couldn't only watch once, but you only want to watch it once. It might be that this movie could be a cult movie in the future like the original Blade Runner did.","Annihilation",3866,3.8,0.8
"3867",2,"  It was actually quite boring. Beatiful and well-made, though. It had a lot of nice ideas which weren't presented in a decent way, and I hated all the flashbacks/flashforwards. I would say that 80% of the film was wasted.Also, it had the most stereotypical portrayal of a lesbian I have seen in recent years (and, SPOILER, she is the only character we see suffer a horrible death, reinforcing the Evil/Dead Lesbian Trope).Oh, and I liked the soundtrack. It was nice that you didn't have to reach for the volume control every two minutes.","Annihilation",3867,3.8,1.8
"3868",5,"  This is a beautiful yet macabre sci-fi that will leave you scratching your head. The cast did a great job, everyone seemed to suit their roles. After the credits I found myself wanting to know so much more about the world and the creatures in it. If you really hate gore you may not like it but there isn't that much of it. Undoubtedly worth the watch,","Annihilation",3868,3.8,-1.2
"3869",4,"  I am in a state of cognitive dissonance about this film. From one side, it abandons all logic when it comes to 1) the decision-making for the organization, the resources and the execution of the mission by the government and the main characters and 2) the multiplicity of perspectives among people with common tendencies. From the other side, I haven't been so gripped, so thoughtful and so utterly horrified after watching a thriller in a long while! The visuals are mesmerizing and, yes, this film definitely expresses interesting ideas! The problem is... nobody is 100% sure which are those ideas! Revisiting all the clues we were given, I am highly confident about where the writer wanted to arrive and... it seems to be exactly were I thought he arrived in the first place. Certainly, vagueness forces the viewers to contemplate more on what they just saw and people will have interesting conversations about this film. Nevertheless, I think if one or two things were stated more clearly, the wider audience would have walked out more satisfied with this film. Recently, many mediocre artsy movies with a lot of flare and nothing at the core have shamelessly overused the vagueness card. As an audience, I would find some philosophical unambiguity refreshing. Overall, this film is haunting and seems to express some considerations about alternative intelligent life forms and our interaction with them, but is held back by some glaring mistakes that, upon editing, might have been avoided.","Annihilation",3869,3.8,-0.2
"3870",5,"  Annihilation (2018) is a very intense, off the wall sci-fi movie that is filled with death, love, stunning visuals, and a bit of horror. The best part about Annihilation is that there is an all-female lead cast which is really significant and sends a statement considering the circumstances in Hollywood pertaining to gender. Not only are they bad ass women but they are also smart women who are each a different type of scientist, and that isn't something we see too often in these types of movies or in movies at all. I give Annihilation 5 out of 5 stars for keeping me entertained throughout the entirety of it and for making me want to read the novel that it is based off of. Usually I read the book and then watch the movie but that wasn't the case for Annihilation. If the movie is this good then the book has the be mind-blowing.  I really enjoyed the way Director Alex Garland set up the story, he cuts between past and present scenes throughout the movie. He gives us the background of Lena, the main character of the movie, and the life she is living as a biologist professor at Johns Hopkins. She hasn't seen or heard from her husband in a year. He shows up and it's as if his memory has been completely wiped away. His health starts to deteriorate quickly and the government takes Kane and Lena to Area X and she learns of ""the shimmer"" This is where the movie starts to get mind-altering, almost hallucinatory.  The shimmer is a place that defies the laws of nature, is drenched in colors and is visually striking. Garland makes the shimmer seem like a place of fantasy and a place that you would want to spend time in until something very dark emerges. That dark is the unknown and a place that is changing at a fast rate. There are flowers that are all the same species but very different looking. The animals that were once normal are evolving into monsters that have never been seen. In the very first scary scene there is an alligator that looks like an alligator but isn't quite like the alligators we are used to seeing. Not only is everything around them changing but they are changing as well. The group of women have to deal with this prism that refracts everything, with their own minds and if they can trust each other or not which is pretty great to watch because I think most people would feel the same way. I believe a soundtrack can make or break a movie and Annihilation's soundtrack definitely made the movie. The darkest parts are accompanied by equally dark music. Not only are we seeing some pretty horrific scenes we are hearing music that helps those goosebumps run from head to toe. Music that makes you feel as if you are actually there experiencing every bit of the shimmer. The music was never over used but used at just the right times, filled with intensity and made you feel disoriented. The swimming pool scene is by far one of the creepiest and the music really contributes to that creepiness, like nails on a chalkboard. In this scene we see the body of a man, who was part of a previous group that entered the shimmer, stuck up on the wall of the deep end of a swimming pool. The music we hear in this scene is not really music at all but more like an alarm that gets louder and louder as we see this body that has mutated in to something very out of this world.There's nothing worse than watching a movie with terrible acting, especially when you pay to see it in a theater. The acting in Annihilation is good and Natalie Portman does an excellent job in my opinion. I have seen a few movies she has done in the past where I thought she didn't do too well (Where the Heart Is) but she blew me away in Annihilation, she makes you feel like you aren't watching a movie. One scene that I think she did incredibly well in is the scene when she gets to the lighthouse and the humanoid emerges from the hole in the wall. She is watching this humanoid mimic her but it's a CGI character. She moves beautifully and makes it seem like the humanoid isn't CGI at all but rather a real person.Gareth Edwards Monsters (2010) has a similar plot to Annihilation's but one is far better than the other. The quality of Annihilation out weights Monsters by far. I'm sure budget has something to do with this but I was quite bored while watching Monsters, and I was on the edge of my seat, beginning to end while watching Annihilation. Garland gives us just the right amount of background on the main characters and Edwards' entire movie is focused entirely on the background. If I am going to watch a sci-fi movie about aliens I want to see more of the aliens. There's nothing wrong with a little romance in a sci-fi movie but that's all I saw in Monsters.Garland is giving us more questions than answers in Annihilation and I like movies like this because they keep us talking after the movie has ended. I watched this movie with my significant other and we left the theater with a bizarre feeling that's almost impossible to put into words, like a disconnect between mind and body and not unlike the otherworldly sensation of tripping on mushrooms. We talked about the movie for the entirety of our thirty-minute drive home and I think that says a lot about how well this movie is made. If you are in to sci-fi movies that are filled with great acting, great music, great visuals, and a great story then you will most likely enjoy Annihilation.","Annihilation",3870,3.8,-1.2

"3872",3.5,"  A Black Swan and a brown bearANNIHILATIONCerebral sci-fi is very hard to get. Yet, some of the fascination about it comes from its sparseness. Alex Garland's new film is engaging both from a production point of view (the decisions of its distributors to opt for Netflix instead of theatrical may be a sign of a what the future holds for many films) and as a base of discussion of its themes. It's a film with a tight screenplay that develops its characters well enough for us to care and hides us just enough to keeps us guessing. It's paired with non-linear editing which, although truly disorienting in some instances, is progressively building tension. Some great visual effects (I live for the mould!) are paired with amazingly accomplished sequences that we are sure to continue to talk about. Regardless of any inconsistencies and a lack of care in the direction of some parts where it becomes dull, the movie greatest strength is its faithfulness to theme and consistency with the ideas it sets out from the get go. That of course, may throw some people off but your disdain shouldn't come from a lack of a clear answer or the inexistence of someone who tells you what the movie is about, but from the execution. Yes, the ending is hard to understand but if you say that you dislike the film because you didn't grasp its latter part, then you're missing the point, you're stuck in the classic construction where an interpretation is given to you instead of you speculating it. It's openness is what makes the film debatable, rewatchable and perfectly independent as a modern work of art. SPOILERish zoneI believe the film's meaning and themes to be quite clear: it sets out the idea that the human being has a natural tendency for self-destructiveness, as is the case with cancer cells replicating and mutating to eventually kill the body they inhabit. As so, that idea is carried out through the woman's motives for being in The Shimmer (they feel a drive to head out to a dangerous unknown which will probably kill them) and the finale, in which The Shimmer allows its destruction. That is finished off by the ending when Lena, a physically unaltered person willingly hugs the copy (the mutant which comes from replication) knowing that she would become contaminated (she wants to self-destruct). The Shimmer itself serves as a metaphor for humanity at a greater level, as its mutations that end up creating a para-utopia are destroyed by themselves. So not only it can be read as a self-destruction of the individual but also the annihilation that humans are doomed to inflict on themselves if environmentally unfriendly habits and political stances are carried out. We, in many ways are the replicated being burning our own lighthouse, the place we inhabit and grow from. Also, Lena is beautifully constructed has she feels the need to repair what she has done to her husband who only sought annihilation by going in the Shimmer when he found out she was cheating. Also, the theme of replication is carried out through the concept of the Shimmer in which versions of real life are presented as a not so distant cousins. As the wonderful soul-eating bear is a refracted version of a real one, so is the replicated being who becomes Lena's mutation. Also, I love that the deconstruction of the narrative allows to drive this theme forward, as the metaphysical aspects of the film make it extremely unsettling. The monster is us, as many sci-fi movies have told but this film is a beast.","Annihilation",3872,3.8,0.3
"3873",4.5,"  A fascinating movie that captivates you and never lets go. It's wildly different from the original material, but it's a very good movie nevertheless. The actresses shine in a simple but effective movie.","Annihilation",3873,3.8,-0.7

"3875",1,"  Really bad. Vague storyline and simplistic ""what is the nature of mankind"" themes. Great visuals though and some concepts that could have been much better explored.

She's easily the best part of the movie-The visuals are great-The concept is pretty good-The last 20 minutes are goodAnd the bad:-The first half is so mediocre. I'd even go as far as saying it's bad.-Everyone besides Portman is sort of meh. -The writing isn't great.-The execution is pretty bad. I don't understand, why they would send in a team of scientist after several teams of soldiers didn't return. Some of them don't even have combat training.It's worth a watch.

A prime example of this is towards the end of the movie, during a flashback scene where Issac and Portman's characters literally say ""hey"" to each other as if it's supposed convey some sort of missed love. Plain and simple, the movie is a train wreck.","Annihilation",3879,3.8,3.3

"3884",3,"  No real resolution to the movie","Annihilation",3884,3.8,0.8
"3885",2.5,"  Pretty visuals, but also pretty dumb, or more accurately pseudo smart that fails for me. A disappointment after Garland's Ex Machina. The many ideas that have been peddled before (from at least a dozen films/TV shows), plus the numerous irritating technical anomalies both kept me from getting into it, How many times do soldiers in films walk into contaminated combat zones with no helmets or any kind of protective gear or breathing apparatus? how often do we have to see a guy staring down a microscope and see cells dividing in real time every few seconds? Plus the ""twist"" at the end is pretty much laid on a plate in the opening scenes. I want to go back and watch Netflix's other recent SF offering, Mute. That was pretty bonkers but at least it kept me guessing **1/2","Annihilation",3885,3.8,1.3

"3889",5,"  I strongly recommend people go to the nearest theater and see ""Annihilation"".You could also use the proxmate chrome extension, select the UK as your region, and watch it on Netflix*.* Long story short, Netflix bought the rights to the film, but it was marketed for release in the US with underwhelming box office numbers. Ipso facto, you can watch it this way. It probably won't accept your password, so just change it for that visit.If you've seen the previews, you're probably thinking, why is he recommending an alien SciFi horror flick, will we make it in time, and why did I bring helium instead of air? Aside from the fact that Natalie Portman is my shalomie homie and can rap better than Post Malone, this movie is intense--visually, suspensefully, and emotionally**.** Full disclosure: I did watch this movie the first time on 1.0 metric spores of Boomers. 9/10 will do again with 1.0 more just for the visuals.*** Warning - Slight spoilers ahead, but mostly just framing how the movie should/might be interpreted ***Here's the thing--the movie is an allegory for depression. It's loosely based off the first book in the Southern Reach Trilogy. Some key parts are there, but it largely diverges from the series. The movie is written and directed by the same guy (Alex Garland) that gave us another brilliant piece of SciFi cinematic excellence, ""Ex Machina"".Annihilation is, as it's mentioned in the film--self destruction, juxtaposed against an alien/biological ""virus"". The Shimmer (Area X in the book) is depression. Some fight it, face it, let it consume them (Just when you thought DiCaprio had it bad going against a bear in ""The Revenant""), or just accept it as a part of them. The dialogue throughout the movie is very revealing, especially when you think about it abstractly as if you are viewing the depression/shimmer and every character in it from a first person point-of-view with a third person perspective.What?! Exactly.There will be a scene where Lena (Natalie Portman) and Sheppard (Tuva Novotny) are rowing on a boat through the swamp--at this point Sheppard provides all the baggage for every character (an alcoholic, someone suicidal/scarred, someone fighting cancer, someone that's lost someone else, and someone that's lost themself because of a loss). It's very poignant dialogue.Are there gruesome scenes that might make it difficult to watch? Yes. Of course. It's a SciFi horror flick, you dingus! But you know what? Depression is hard to face and look at, and sometimes you have to have a friend cut you open and show your insides moving around to know that things are changing.Ultimately, people go into it and never really come out. If they do--are they different, or just fooling themselves and everyone else into thinking they are?","Annihilation",3889,3.8,-1.2
"3890",3.5,"  Thought-provoking, visually compelling and led by fine performances from its female cast, Annihilation has some positive points, but ultimately it turns out to be confusing and pretensious.","Annihilation",3890,3.8,0.3
"3891",4,"  A great sci-fi film that kept me involved in the story until the 3rd act. I was a bit tired so it might have been that, but overall the ending was filled with strange twists and turns that I had a really hard time following. I think you really have to be involved in the film to understand what it is saying, and I realize it doesn't hurt to read some of the write-ups after the fact. I think it is a beautiful film that deals with a lot of complex issues, so I reccomend it, but don't watch this when you want a light story or are looking for fun, it is deep for sure.","Annihilation",3891,3.8,-0.2

"3894",4.5,"  Great, smart and creepy sci-fi. Highly recommended.","Annihilation",3894,3.8,-0.7
"3895",4,"  Annihilation is very good film with one serious flaw.The film explores important questions of evolution and identity. Who are we and how do we change, both as individuals and as a species? How would life which evolved on two different worlds interact? I could even sense a faint resonance with Solaris by Tarkovsky (not the Hollywood mess). Strong performances, with Portman as lead, keep the viewer engaged.The flaw is a completely irrelevant subplot centered on the Gyasi character. This was clearly added in an effort to molify those with a race-centric political agenda.Despite this serious flaw, Annihilation is worth seeing.","Annihilation",3895,3.8,-0.2
"3896",4.5,"  Unusual piece for Natalie Portman - but she works well in it. Not without flaws, especially in the ending, but I enjoyed it as much as any of the maze runner's and more than the Divergent series, which this feels rather like.","Annihilation",3896,3.8,-0.7

"3903",2.5,"  Great concept poorly executed. Warning: Spoilers.Okay so the idea of an alien mutating and combining DNA is pretty cool. I wasn't a fan of the special effects (twist some plastic flowers around some treetrunks anyone?) but could have ignored that. However there were just too many plot holes that I couldn't ignore. I mean, just to list a couple off the top of my head:- Everything gets mutated. Sure, I get that. But then why did they lose track of time?- Why didn't the army hang-glide into the lighthouse? Or wingsuit? Or boat in? Or at least go in along the shoreline? Why send them in through the path of most resistance - i.e, the jungle?- Why didn't they firebomb the area once their teams stopped coming back, and they noticed the shimmer growing? - Why didn't the previous crew leave something *actually useful* on the video camera, instead of creepily cutting someone up. Like, a quick warning - ""hey guys, we're mutating, you probably are too, maybe you should get out and tell someone instead of going to the lighthouse. Also, be careful of the giant bear..."" would have been pretty damn useful.- basic army training: ""great work on finding a tower for us all to sleep in gals. Now, let's set up a watchperson on the ground where anyone can attack them, and have a massive lantern shining so we attract predators and ruin our night vision.""- why didn't the military units ever make it to the lighthouse? I mean, a team of scientists did. And it's not like their 'science powers' actually helped them. The thing that helped the most was guns. And you know who had guns and knows how to use them properly? All the previous military teams.I could go on, but I'll stop. this wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't great. I wouldn't watch it again.","Annihilation",3903,3.8,1.3
"3904",4.5,"  A brilliantly made, intelligent, and often horrifying hard sci-fi film that certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, and is a bit vague in terms of plot (instead prioritizing a more artistic, contemplative, thematic story); but is still nothing short of a masterpiece that you truly have to see to believe (or even understand).","Annihilation",3904,3.8,-0.7
"3905",0.5,"  Ignoring all the logical inconsistencies, the physical inaccuracies, and the psychological incompatibilities, this was a great movie! I read quite a few of the reviews, and many people make great points when it comes to the simplicity of the ending of the invasion. However, I didn't find any that delve into the absolute absurdity of the ending! That was, to me, the biggest ""heeell no"" of them all. 1. We find out that the ""thing"" that is invading, copies DNA, and uses it to make random new things from them.2. We are shown that the husband has been copied, befriended his copy, and told his copy to find his wife. (which seems to be really, really stupid to me.) 3. Why did the cancer-ridden Doctor not also get copied? What was the point of the whole light show we got? 4. Once she knew that the husband was an alien copy. what was the point of the hug? Was she just happy that she got SOME version of her husband back?5. During the hug, why do her eyes change color? What was that supposed to tell us?Honestly, after overlooking most of the bull that was served in this film, I find myself begging for an ending that was, if not creative, then cliche; anything would have been better than what we got!I cannot recommend more that all humans that require some intellectual stimulation to enjoy a movie, avoid the crap out of this one. I want my time back. I am closer to my death now and wish I had wasted this time more wisely!","Annihilation",3905,3.8,3.3
"3906",4,"  Annihilation is a tense, uneasy, mystery that unnerves the audience and gives them a story to ponder. The plot centers around Natalie Portman's character who goes into the Shimmer to find out what happened to her husband. She's joined by several other women as they face the horror and mystery inside. The plot is solid but takes awhile to get going. The Flashbacks are unnecessary and slow the story down. But once it picks up, it turns gruesome and begins to be terrifying, creating a sense of dread that sticks with you even after it's over. Visually, this movie is stunning, from the mutated creatures to the environment surrounding the characters. The score is also a stand out and is very haunting. Acting wise, most of them do solid jobs with Portman giving a great performance. And as the story comes to a close, it is mostly satisfying and validated what came before it. Overall, Annihilation is a well directed sci-fi film with some genuinely scary moments and stunning visuals though it runs a little too long and slow at times.","Annihilation",3906,3.8,-0.2
"3907",2,"  Natalie Portman is gorgeous in this, acting superb. Some interesting visual effects (I didn't really enjoy them). Writers built on some decent themes, played with the audience's mind and expectations a bit. Well done.Couldn't stand the movie once we got to the cave. That was the climax of the story I suppose, but the images and sounds left me feeling physically ill. Like nails scraping against a chalk board. Ugh.This movie gets a low rating because the images and sounds left me nauseous and irritated. Not worth watching if you are susceptible to such things.You'll also be frustrated if you don't like ambiguous/challenging endings.","Annihilation",3907,3.8,1.8

"3920",3.5,"  Good Writing: 1.5 StarsThis was the weakest aspect of the movie. The potential was there but it fell short with not properly thought out motives for its characters. The majority of the plot revolves around the stars trekking through a swamp by foot to reach a light house on the coastline. Why they couldn't use a vehicle or even take the coast line to get to the lighthouse to begin with was not mentioned. Beyond the supernatural aspect of this movie, normal human behavior to circumstance was ignored. And when a character is sharing their recollection of past events, you cant have flashbacks during their recollection.Great Production: 2 starsThis is where the movie shined. Sound, music, set design and special affects were all super intense and vivid! Gotta love bears!","Annihilation",3920,3.8,0.3
"3921",2.5,"  Well produced but absurd and a terrible ending.","Annihilation",3921,3.8,1.3
"3922",4.5,"  In stepping back from the tradition sci-fi tropes of an alien invasion, Annihilation offers a thought-provoking and original storyline to the credit of the source material. Those aware of the Southern Reach trilogy might appreciate the vagueness of the characters and the lack of traditional protagonist/antagonist storyline. Intentionally underdeveloped, the characters are by no means compelling, but certainly well-acted and purposeful. The soundtrack is superb and the blend of themes transition effortlessly in this intelligently-written story. There are moments that could have used further explanation and the ambiguous ending may frustrate some, but in Annihilation Alex Garland has succeeded in creating an original, tense and enjoyable sci-fi thriller, that will leave watchers thinking even after repeat viewing.","Annihilation",3922,3.8,-0.7
"3923",1.5,"  Wow, what a steaming pile of magical shiny poop! Bear with me.I really, really wanted to like this movie. I'm a sucker for brilliant and intriguing ideas. Plus, with such an amazing cast it would be hard to go wrong, right? Well.Let's start with the good stuff:+ the acting was as good as it's gonna get when you force great actors to be constantly stunned and whisper-mumble in proper indie-movie fashion+some of it is really prettyNow the bad, and it's a lot:- Characters: We don't know anything about them except their professions. Their motivations are either not there or questionable. Like our main character Lena, whose husband is the lone survivor returning from the mysterious shimmer and suddenly and unreasonably starts spitting blood. Now here's what I don't understand - if someone comes back from Hiroshima with cancer or from Malaysia with Malaria nobody would actually suggest going there to find a cure. No, you'd look at the patient's body and look for a cause. Instead of some lame scene of our main characters being all Instagram-perfect in their sun-flooded bedroom, we could have really needed a scene explaining character motivation. How am I going to root for a character if I'm not invested in their cause?- Randomness to simulate meaning:A popular indie-film trick is to show us a lot of random awkward scenes to poke at our raw human-ness, which is great if there actually is a deeper meaning behind it. But this movie tries really hard to be about human identity, which has little to do with the plot and also we never quite get there. Instead, we see scenes of our main character cheating, which contributes nothing to the story and doesn't get resolved, either. And then there's that scene where they lose their memory, for no reason except it lets the producer of the hook because they don't have to shoot how they got there. - No one was employed to research the actual science:My biggest pet hate is when I'm taken for stupid. Okay, so (SPOILER) summary, within the shimmer, DNA gets scattered like ""light on a prism"". Amazingly interesting concept. Unfortunately, rock doesn't have DNA, so there's nothing to scatter for it to turn to dirt. Come on, now. Every sci-fi movie gets away with a little science mumbo-jumbo but that's just downright embarrassing.- Modern danceThe end made no sense, not scientifically, not logically. (SPOILER) I mean come on you're telling me in three years no one has tried to set fire to the thing? Plus, if it was that sensitive it would have burned up when entering the atmosphere. Seriously?There is one thing that the movie does really well, though - it shows how open the audience is to trickery. The movie is set up to look deep and meaningful and gloomy and looking at the ratings it has worked. A lot of mumbling, weirdness, randomness and a Stranger Things type soundtrack emulate real depth, sense and make try to brush over the fact that this movie has no coherent plot whatsoever.","Annihilation",3923,3.8,2.3
"3924",3.5,"  other then needing a few tweaks this was a enjoyable movie to watch. i wish they would have delve deeper into the mutation aspect rather than the mental aspect. i could see this as a 5 star sci-fi horror if they did.","Annihilation",3924,3.8,0.3
"3925",4,"  The second directorial offering from Alex Garland, who previously brought us the excellent Ex Machina, Annihilation doesn't match the quality or intrigue of what came before, but most of it is still a solid and very well put together movie. It's not as thought-provoking as it wants to be, and the climax is pure ridiculous Sci-fi, a classic example of a film nearly squandering a great build with a silly ending that feels entirely out of place and random. But the build is more than worth the watch. The steady camera movements and the stunning cinematography create an atmosphere of wonder and foreboding, and the CGI doesn't ever distract from the storyline. I love Natalie Portman as an actress, and while this might not be her best work, she still gives it her all and I was completely invested in her character. The rest of the cast are great too, at least for the limited time they're onscreen. It's framing device of a post-incident interview is completely unnecessary and only serves to spoil what's going to happen. Not to mention none of the dialogue in these scenes explains anything we couldn't have worked out for ourselves, or haven't already seen take place. But a few missteps aside, Annihilation is further evidence of a great talent that should kept an eye on in the years to come, and is a fun experience while it lasts.","Annihilation",3925,3.8,-0.2

"3931",5,"  A masterful film that plays off of VandeerMeer's original masterpiece. Annihilation will leave your mind swimming within the Shimmer and this film will haunt your mind for days, weeks, and months on end. It's one of those films that is the same caliber as the Matrix or Minority Report. It leaves so much to the imagination. As a viewer you ultimately decide what the fate of the protagonist and humanity is as the Shimmer continues to expand and mutate the globe.","Annihilation",3931,3.8,-1.2

"3934",3.5,"  Writing 1.5 stars. This was the weakest aspect of the movie. The potential was there but it fell short with not properly thought out motives for its characters. The majority of the plot revolves around the stars trekking through a swamp by foot to reach a light house on the coastline. Why they couldn't use a vehicle or even take the coast line to get to the lighthouse to begin with was not mentioned. Beyond the supernatural aspect of this movie, normal human behavior to circumstance was ignored. And when a character is sharing their recollection of past events, you cant have flashbacks during their recollection.Production 2.0 stars. This is where the movie shined. Sound, music, set design and special affects were all super intense and vivid! Gotta love bears!","Annihilation",3934,3.8,0.3
"3935",3,"  The only thing I liked about this movie was the ambiguous, non-cliche version of an alien. An alien that doesn't want anything, and isn't really anything until the end.

"3939",3,"  An interesting, if a bit confusing at times, movie. It is visually stunning and very well put together. A mostly female cast does a very good job. Basically this is a SciFi movie based on Jeff Vandermee's award winning SciFi novel. The story is not told in chronological order, but I figured it out soon. Natalie Portman is the focus and she does a good job. It must of held my attention because we talked about it all through lunch. Recommended, but don't expect too much.","Annihilation",3939,3.8,0.8
"3940",1,"  This film is pretty consistently really nice to look at, I'll certainly admit that. However,, the utterly nonsensical plot eclipses this small positive. The film is difficult to watch without laughing. The characters make decisions and act in ways that are simply laughable, and are totally unrelatable. Those who rate it highly are incapable of logical thought or independent thinking. The critics are horribly wrong.1 star.","Annihilation",3940,3.8,2.8
"3941",4.5,"  After 'Ex Machina' which was a fantastic mix of science fiction and thriller, visionary director Alex Garland delivers again with Annihilation - a sci-fi horror hybrid which is influenced particularly by 'Alien' in the horror department and the works of Tarkovsky in its psychology/SF department but ends up being a unique mix of ideas regardless. His direction is brilliant and he is quickly becoming one of the best directors working today, Natalie Portman's lead performance is reliably terrific and the film is very clever and artistic thanks to the arresting visuals of The Shimmer, creepy, strange and fittingly otherworldly score and many fascinating metaphors and conversations. The highlights include the creature attack scene which is impressively unnerving and the ending which is of course admirably ambiguous and open for many different interpretations.","Annihilation",3941,3.8,-0.7
"3942",3.5,"  This film adaptation of the first book in Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach Trilogy was quite different than the book in certain respects (i.e., there was no tower in the movie, it wasn't as rich as the book in general, and the ending was totally different), but worth the watch.","Annihilation",3942,3.8,0.3
"3943",1,"  So so so awful. instead of doing something in the vain of Resident Evil, they tried to do something similar in tone to Arrival, but with horrible art direction, flat performances, no chemistry with the lead actors, and a complete lack of engaging sound design or music, unless you count the last 10 minutes which was too little too late. I would say that the director, who's other work I really like, was completely up his own ass during this production, but he was definitely blowing himself during the entire production. So he couldn't have been entirely up his own ass.","Annihilation",3943,3.8,2.8
"3944",3,"  It's a metaphor, just not a very good one.","Annihilation",3944,3.8,0.8

"3947",3,"  I recently finished reading the novel Annihilation which I enjoyed to an extent but a lot of it was lost on me and I found I couldn't really connect with any of the characters who all felt very anonymous. In Alex Garland's film the characters are a little more fleshed out, given names and back stories which I felt helps the viewer to connect. The storyline stays pretty close to the novel in that a team of specialists are sent into a site of an environmental disaster known as Area X. Previous teams sent in have all suffered various grim fates and the area seems to be evolving it's own species of plants and animals. As the team heads towards the epicentre which is a lighthouse they become suspicious of the reasons each of them is there and are slowly being stalked by something sinister.I thought the film was ok, it was a lot easier to get to grips with than the novel. The highlight was near the end and the discovery of what was in the lighthouse which visually was mind blowing and it was also a bit of a head-spinner story wise (especially compared with the revelations regarding the lighthouse in the book which are somewhat different). It was just a shame that the journey to the impressive ending was a bit of a slog. One other thing I very much enjoyed was the creature who emits the noise of the last person or thing they killed made, that was very creepy!Despite not enjoying this as much as his first feature, Ex Machina, it is still obvious that Alex Garland is a visionary director and if rumours are correct , I'm very curious as to what he will bring to a Swamp Thing movie!","Annihilation",3947,3.8,0.8

"3969",3,"  Between 2.5 and 3. Although it maintains a good atmosphere most of the time, the lack of scientific credibility and the twisted end (more obssesed with high quality visual show than for a solid story) make some puzzlement at the end.","Annihilation",3969,3.8,0.8
"3970",1.5,"  A movie that seems to believe that making something purposefully confusing doesn't make it good. This movie is plain and 'tries to hard'. The plot twist can be seen from a mile away and leaves to many questions and loose ends to the story. Would not watch again.","Annihilation",3970,3.8,2.3
"3971",2.5,"  There were some pretty scenes with the weird plants and animals but that was about it for me. There probably were so many symbols that I didn't get but overall I found it superficial. I even don't like Natalie Portman in this movie.","Annihilation",3971,3.8,1.3
"3972",2.5,"  There are some interesting parts here, but the movie feels a bit flat. It could have benefited from either picking one genre or the other (scifi or horror) or not pussyfooting around both and just going straight in. I can't help but think this is one of those movies where they (at best) adapt half of a book into a movie, but leave out more than enough to not make it a good watch.","Annihilation",3972,3.8,1.3
"3973",2,"  You can't go wrong with Natalie Portman and she was the main reason why i chose to watch this movie.Unfortunately i thought this movie was lackluster, The soundtrack and editing was the worst part, The first 30 minutes of the movie are promising but then it goes from strange to stranger with no real explaining on what happens in the end.","Annihilation",3973,3.8,1.8

"3975",2,"  The storyline was cliche and not terribly imaginative. The visuals were impressive but inconsistent. The we're just too many holes in the story to make it really entertaining. The plants mutated into human form, but not into any other animal form. The trees mutated into massive crystalline structures, however, not the grass surrounding them. This looks like a really good attempt at making something really unique, but it fell short on delivering and look more like something that belong on the Syfy channel","Annihilation",3975,3.8,1.8
"3976",5,"  Enthralling mesmerising and visually beautiful. I have no idea why this brilliant film did not get released in cinemas. As each of the female protagonists takes their own journey into the mysterious shimmer, they encounter beauty and savagery like nature itself. This is the sort of movie that will haunt you for days and leave you wondering. For me the only weak point was the end that gives answers that feel quite banal after the elusive mysterious of the preceding scenes. Highly recommended.","Annihilation",3976,3.8,-1.2
"3977",2.5,"  Thirty-nine years after Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpiece, director Alex Garland, who debuted with ""Ex Machina"" in 2014, released last month his version of ""Stalker"" called ""Annihilation,"" a fitting title as it ""refracts"" the original beauty of ""Stalker"" into something unrecognizable.The film's main premise rests predominantly on the Shimmer, a soap bubble-like field that slowly growing, mutating and ""refracting"" the DNA of all that it touches. In the film, Lena (Natalie Portman) is grieving the loss of her husband. When she musters up enough courage to paint their bedroom, her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) appears. Not long after, Kane starts coughing up blood, and eventually they all get taken to Area X, a super top secret military base. This parallels the story of ""Stalker,"" where the mysterious Stalker acts as guide for three unnamed men and take them deep into the Zone, all in hopes of finding the Room, which can grant them any wish. Like ""Annihilation"", ""Stalker"" also doesn't pick up until 40 minutes in, wherein they finally step into the Zone.All this exposition, though uncomfortable for any other movie, works well here. It establishes the characters, and had the movie any depth, it would allow us to care about and understand them. ""Annihilation's"" first pitfall is that none of the characters are particularly likable and are more akin to walking stereotypes. The movie refuses to believe in the audience's abilities, repeatedly using flashback sequences to reiterate a point, patronizing the audience.One of the reasons why ""Stalker"" is hailed as a masterpiece is due to its method of storytelling. Unlike later directors such as Wong Kar-Wai, the formula for a character study had not yet been laid. The idea of a story without a plot was still new. But ""Stalker""at its very core was a character study on not only the three unnamed men, but also a metaphor for life.At the core of ""Annihilation"" is a ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" - a movie that leaves the audience wondering what in the world is going on, and whether they've had a ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"" or the turd kind. ""Annihilation"" also suffers from ""Interstellar"" syndrome - the need to explain everything in a scientific way, but then suddenly turning a blind eye to science by asserting that somehow love transcends space and time. In this case, the Shimmer can simply do what it likes with complete disregard to everything that happened earlier. As Dr. Lena put it, ""That's literally not possible.""""Annihilation"" takes but does not give. It steals from countless classics with its cinematography, set design and plot. Even the dilapidated wooden shack that Tarkovsky loves so much is in the movie, as well as the stargate sequence from the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""But ""Annihilation"" does not even attempt to build upon its predecessors. Annihilation"" would be seen as an inaccessible movie that tries to be a bit everything while succeeding at none.","Annihilation",3977,3.8,1.3

"3983",3.5,"  It's a smart film that sadly doesn't expect the same from the audience. There's a lot of greatness here that could be found after some editing. Certainly worth a view, but you'll be left with a fair bit of disappointment.Annihilation's strength is in its sense of wonder. It introduces intriguing ideas, but seems to be terrified of alienating its viewers - something entirely at odds with its premise. The biggest offender occurs not long after they enter The Shimmer. In a scene that seems much more at home in a Predator-esque popcorn film, a character explains how each member of their group is, as she puts it, ""damaged goods."" We need none of this information. The only person's story that comes into play (even thematically) is a woman whose long sleeves, we're told, are hiding the evidence of self-harm. Do we see her arms? Of course we do. So why, exactly, did we need to be told? Surely the filmmakers expected us to be able to piece it together.It's the quiet, unexplained moments that truly shine. However, it's understandable that other reviewers have the exact opposite reaction as I do, because of the inconsistent flip-flopping between ""popcorn thriller"" and ""quiet existential horror."" The latter is done wonderfully, but after trying so hard to keep you in the know, it's a bit jarring to be left uncertain. Kinda like Cloverfield. It was intriguing when you had the barest hint of what was happening, but the film wouldn't leave it be. Frankly, you can skip the entire first act of Annihilation - I imagine you'd have a much better time. Has the main character woken up in her tent yet? If not, fast-forward. As it is now, it disappointingly settles for ""good"" when you know it could be so much more.","Annihilation",3983,3.8,0.3

I was hooked with the premise, curious why a team would be sent that was all female - there's a point, right? (answer: there's no point). What emerges from the dark of the dense foliage can be seen as alien-sided rationalization for the classic ""invasion of the body snatchers' that's interesting, but unfortunately doesn't engage.","Annihilation",3990,3.8,0.8

This isn't a straight up horror movie though, don't expect jump scares or ghosts or anything. It's more alien than that, and I mean that in the sense of the environment. Basically something hit a lighthouse and it's growing shimmer that nobody's come out of and that won't ruin anything. That's the beginning to give you an idea. I was captivated the whole time and can't believe that some of the ideas in this movie weren't thought of before.","Annihilation",4002,3.8,-1.2

If you have to cut major plot points and scenes out because they ""are not filmable"" then maybe you shouldn't film at all.

I wish I could have my two hours of my life back. It was just pointless. There's not much else to say. A couple actually walked out of the film about halfway through.

"4015",4.5,"  So here's the thing with Annihilation, it's really hard to put a finger on what it really is, but it has a certain vibe to it that sets your mind loose, that very feeling is carefully shaped by Alex Garland, the way he writes is mind-blowing, he makes the obvious sounds and feels mysterious, with this film everything is set right and acted and executed beautifully but ultimately you feel like something is off much like the film's unfoldings which leads me to think that Garland wanted it that way and that's brilliant.Natalie Portman performs elegantly as she carries us through an array of feelings and emotions and that displays her full range, she's a very talented actress to say the least.Alex Garland once again brutally challenges our minds and dares us to think wildly and that's exactly what this genre should be all about, I feel like it's very necessary to think about the unknown and films like that are as close as we're gonna get for now at least.Films like Annihilation are very hard to describe not due to complexity but it's because it's meant to be felt and experienced rather than be understood and that right there is amazing, All in all, Annihilation is extremely good and definitely worth watching.","Annihilation",4015,3.8,-0.7
"4016",3.5,"  It's all thematics, without heart. I enjoyed the spectacle of the movie without particularly caring a bit for their fates. High-concept sci-fi is my totally in my wheel-house, so little of what this movie was after went over my head; it's just that immediacy of the narrative needs to inspire the audiences introspection into the nuances of the film so to allow a generative dialog with the audience that persists long after the movie is over. If you don't care/identify with any of the characters, the movie comes of as a sterile experience and will fall flat despite all it merits. Annihilation was lots of merits, but I think it will fall of deaf ears for most. That said, I love that risky high-concept sci-fi is still able to get attention. Annihilation, despite its flaws, is totally worth your time.","Annihilation",4016,3.8,0.3

Any reviewer or critic calling this film a ""Masterpiece"" is written by either a woman and/or a SJW Shill, who gave the movie 5-Stars before they even saw it simply because it had a female cast.

"4027",5,"  Absolutely incredible. The entire film itself was a reflection of the theme on mutation: it subtly mutated from drama to sci-fi to horror and back again, unnerving the viewer with each unexpected shift; it disturbs for the same reason the creatures and order within the Shimmer disturbs: it defies and refuses to follow the natural laws of what typically trust to expect. I understand why someone who wants to see a tidy sci-fi action movie would leave thinking this is a muddled mess, but it was so much more. As a biologist, this movie was incredible to watch, and spoke to so many of my constant thoughts on the tension between our brain's need to construct a sense of permanence as we move around this world (our personal narratives, the physical presence of our bodies, our inability to truly comprehend death) and the fact of the matter that the natural world and our inherent biology is simply a constant assault on any sort of stasis. Physically, we are different people at the end of each day with cell death and cell growth. Mentally, we are different people each year with the burden of new experiences. This movie took that tension and amplified it (and sped it up) to an incredible degree, using this to showcase how life is ultimately death is ultimately life, and that any sense of boundaries or borders that we may imagine as bodies with skin to close us off from the world is nothing but a lark: we are permeable bags of organic matter, and every minute that passes leaves us changed. Whew, this movie. There are a hundred other themes to speak on, including our inherent bent toward self destruction - the ego's way of coping with the incomprehensible fact of our ultimate demise - getting in one's own way, the weight of new experiences, the profound indifference of nature (watching this film took me back to my first read of Steven Crane's ""The Open Boat""), mutations, etc. TL;DR: If you're looking for a tidy sci-fi action flick, this isn't it. If you're fascinated by the natural world, and wonder about the tension between our brain's need for a sense of status and the inherent chaos and assault of constant change by the natural world on everything it entails, check this out. Whether you love it or not, it'll make your brain buzz for a little while, at least, and it's a whole lot of fun.","Annihilation",4027,3.8,-1.2

Brief: Something weird is happening and has been for over a year, gonna consume the earth eventually. They keep sending in people and equipment but none come back.

"4039",5,"  garland is one of the most interesting filmmakers in the market at the moment and this film is another successful venture for him, but it is not the book by any means. I loved the book and while this film has the soul of the overall arc, it never hits the same beats which might disappoint hardcode fans of the book. the film is a cerebral mind bending experience that will leave you scratching your head, much like the book and I think this will alienate the audience. I am calling this as a film that will be on top 10 lists within the next 20 years, this is Kubrick colours and visual art at the tallest order, a modern cult film that will linger with filmgoers. I mentioned the book earlier and I'm slightly annoyed that this robbed the audience of seeing that book adaption. this changes everything and as a huge fan of the book it annoys me that they only keep the name and distance themselves from the book which begs the question of buying the rights to the book. this reminds me of Kubrick and king tension after the shining opened, if I was vandermeer I would be slightly annoyed that this film failed to capture the true story of the book, the next books continue the mystery and they will never see the light of day on film due to this film changing so much. 20-03-2018.","Annihilation",4039,3.8,-1.2

"4041",5,"  Loved it. loved it. loved it. left me thinking. left me baffled. left me confused but not too confused. left me in awe. what a bizarre and engrossing movie. i was with it from start to finish. loved the story of self destruction. loved the biologicall and cancer aspect to it. loved the mental aspect to it. all of our physical and mental tendencies to self destruct are fascinating. the connection that natalie portman and oscar isaac had at the end when both of there eyes lit up with the shimmer, to me that confused the whole thing a bit. who was the alien she was facing at the end. i think it was 25% alien 75% natalie portmans self destructive nature. it was her own self destruction that was fighting her living/fighting being. when she defeats the alien, i was asking the question, 'Who are we with out of self destructive habits? with our flaws and ticks and problems? who are if we strip ourselves of what may be strongest force within or DNA, our capacity and insistence on self destruction? self destruction by any and all means. addiction, alcoholism, poor choices, spite, jealousy, laziness, depression. We define ourselves and lets ourselves be defined by the self destruction within all of us. who are we if we rid ourselves of that. in a way we are a shell of ourselves.'i loved how the alien didnt really have any interest in what was happening. It didnt have a particular stake in the game. was only acting in its own organic process. it never became the outright villain. it never cheapened itself by relying on villainy and trope.question: if natalie portman killed the alien at the end... how did it survive within her and he husband? ... I kind of think it was just a red herring.","Annihilation",4041,3.8,-1.2
"4042",4,"  Whenever we end up with a ""what does it all mean""-affair, the key question is what the movie offers next to the talking points of future film school seminars.

"4043",2,"  Long slow moving film","Annihilation",4043,3.8,1.8
"4044",3,"  The movie starts out terrifically. It creates a great foundation for the film to form and builds direct tension. This voltage can also be kept until 25 minutes before the end. That is a positive aspect. This is what the film creates in which it is very mysterious. ""New"" animal species are discovered, you want to know what this shimmer is and why it spreads. You feel with Lena. You're hoping she'll survive. The movie usually captures very nice pictures, but some CGI effects either look cheap or they should be wanted. But I don't like them. Another problem I have with the movie is that I don't care about all the other characters except Lena. The biggest problem, however, is in my opinion the end (the last 25 minutes). For me, more questions are raised than answered. This does not always have to be bad, because most of the time the film encourages discussion, but in this case it is not so. You just remain completely unaware, you don't know what the film wants to tell you exactly. The film just doesn't seem to be finished. You should have been able to answer a few more questions and omit unnecessary flashbacks from Lena's life. I did not care about them. Nevertheless, the film is very good up to the last 25 minutes and therefore gets 6/10 points.","Annihilation",4044,3.8,0.8
"4045",5,"  This movie was creative, beautiful, and disturbing.

When a meteorite strikes planet Earth, a female team of specialists begin to explore the environmental impact the alien object makes on the surrounding area. I was throughly impressed by the narrative structure, tastefully revealing only enough to keep you satisfied, yet still curious for the duration of the film. Natalie Portman delivers a fantastic performance that will leave you second guessing what you know and believe until the credits roll. Fans of films like Arrival should check out this movie! It will be time well spent.","Annihilation",4048,3.8,0.3
"4049",2.5,"  This movie was... interesting. I have to honestly say I excpected a lot more from it. Since the studios where like: Ohh this movie is too smart for normal movie going audiences. So we better but it on Netflix.Maaan that was the wrong decision. The positive about the movie is actually the visuals and the nearly all female cast. Stand out for me: Natalie, Tessa and Gina. But the story was lacking suspense. Big Time. Also the ""big meaning"" behind this movie wasn't that hard to find out. So to but a movie like that with amazing visuals to netflix is the wrong decision. It would have definitely benefited from the big screens and surround sound of the theater. And since the story wasn't that complicated ( I really excpected a better mistery/ meaning) it would have fitted just fine into the theater.","Annihilation",4049,3.8,1.3
"4050",0.5,"  My IQ dropped 20 points watching this hollow story unfold at a snail pace. They hired Portman but gave her crap material to work with.

"4051",5,"  This is a movie worth seeing twice! I went in with almost no clue what it'd be about, thinking it was going to be bland or generic or what have you. And over the course of the movie, it pulled me in and won me over.The second time through, I'd listened to RLM's video on it and brought a close friend who's a huge film buff to watch it with. I paid closer attention to details and understood a lot more of the meaning behind it. I was actually in tears by the end!I've still been thinking about it for over a week now! Normal movies don't do this to me! A part of why it hit so well with me was because I've had a history of depression, which is a major theme of this film. The nature of it, what it does to us and those around us, and it handles all of this in a smart and respectful way that more people need to hear.Plus as a bonus, it has an all-female cast and doesn't draw attention to it! It doesn't feel forced, all of the characters are well-written, well-acted (including Natalie Portman for the most part).I'd say see this when you have the time, but it's almost out of theaters. This movie deserved better. I genuinely hold this above the likes of Alien or The Thing as my favorite Sci-fi film. It means that much to me!","Annihilation",4051,3.8,-1.2

I know these movie like some of Darren Arnonofskys movies where the clarity is usually a mystery that the audience has to solve. With that being said, the puzzle pieces are always vibrant for us to figure it out, unlike Annihilation which just made me wonder if these two hours were a nice visual experience but an absolute waste of my time.

If you liked The Fountain, Ex Machina, 2001, Intersteller, or Bladrunner then you'll like Annhilation (though I think The Shimmer would've been a better title). The acting, effects, and ideas of the film are great. The ending is definitely weird, not going to deny that. But the bear scene! Holy #%^$!

I loved the book and i was hoping for a stunnig movie from the directer of the Ex-machina (one of my favoriete movie from 2014). What i get is one visual good movie but with the content of one pseudo-intellectual bullshit movie. That ending was a fucking mess. For the people who didn't read the book (which was completely set aside by Alex Garland), you don't have any idea of a great movie you could have had. The character of the biologist is so great in the book, but in the movie it was a fucking cliche of a character. All the structure of the book, and the misteries of the area X are but better that in the movie. I know my opinion is greatly influnced by my apreciacion of the book, but, i assure you, that if most people had read the book the score of this movie was way lower.ps(sorry for my english)","Annihilation",4067,3.8,1.8

"4069",5,"  Beginning his career as an author and responsible for the source material of Danny Boyle's The Beach in 2000, Alex Garland then directly ventured into the film industry by doing screenplay's - again with Boyle on 28 Days Later and Sunshine - before he eventually took the reigns himself by making his directorial debut with the magnificent science fiction film Ex Machina in 2014. On this evidence, it's fair to say that Garland has went from strength to strength and his sophomore film, Annihilation, continues that trend. One could even argue that it's his best work yet.Plot: Lena (Natalie Portman), a cellular biologist and former soldier, joins an expedition to uncover what happened to her husband Kane (Oscar Issac) who disappeared during a mission inside Area X - a swampland across the Florida coastline that was hit by a meteor and is now a sinister and mysterious phenomenon that blocks all contact with the outside world. During the expedition, Lena discovers a world of mutated landscapes and creatures that threatens everything we have come to know about science and evolution and threatens not only her life but also her sanity. Based on the first book in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer we are drip fed the events and conundrum of Annihilation in the three stages of the characters' exploration: Area X, The Shimmer and The Lighthouse. Such is Garland's restrained approach, we are kept very much at arms length about what exactly is going as each of these chapters make little sense. When the film does provide some answers, it only opens it up to even more questions and therein lies the craftsmanship and intrigue of this abstract sci-fi fantasy. What's most apparent, though, is Garland's masterful control of pace and mood and it's his attention to these elements that provide the film with genuinely nightmarish possibilities. Area X is a foreboding, inhospitable land where the laws of physics and nature have turned in on themselves as the environment mutates with new and fascinating results. There are plants that share human DNA and result in growths of eerie, man-like tree structures and animals that retain and replicate the screams of the victims they've killed. Everything refracts as our planet, as we know it, is in the process of evolving into something else entirely. It's this very concept that makes Garland's film a terrifying experience. While it's beautifully shot by cinematographer Rob Hardy and boasts some visually stunning scenes it also has atmosphere in abundance. I've seen genre horrors that have failed to capture half of this films palpable feeling of dread and Garland knows exactly how to handle it's unsettling moments while aided with a hugely effective score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury.Harbouring the weighty themes of grief, suicide and self-destruction, Garland borrows heavily from the paranoia of John Carpenter's The Thing and also channels cancer as its psychological device, while many have compared it to Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 metaphysical film, Stalker. Having recently caught up with that, I can definitely see the resemblance. Tarkovsky's film has a more reflective, philosophical tone to it whereas Garland explores a more scientific nature but the two are certainly bedfellows. Like Stalker, Annihilation refuses to provide easy answers and some might even leave the film frustrated with its ambiguity. However, it's this very ambiguous approach that contributes to the film's allure and fascinating premise. Needless to say, those not willing to put in the effort to work through its many layers will be left sorely disappointed and needn't bother at all. In fact, the film's production studio, Paramount Pictures, voiced their concern on it being too intellectual and complicated for the masses and decided not to release it widely in cinemas in fear of losing money. Instead, a deal was struck with Netflix to internationally distribute it on their streaming service. It's such a shame that films as bold and inventive as this are never given the confidence and respect they deserve. Paramount have been fools in their handling and marketing of this and can only hope that the film's reception doesn't suffer as a result.A haunting and genuinely frightening, sci-fi mystery that's as elliptical and unnerving as Tarkovsky's Stalker and as trippy as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey - with a plethora of other science fiction influences thrown in for good measure. It's only March but already we have one of the potential best films of 2018. This is a truly bold and intriguing undertaking from Alex Garland and he's laid down the gauntlet for the forthcoming year. Mark Walker","Annihilation",4069,3.8,-1.2
"4070",1,"  An amazing and colorful setting that unfortunately didn't use its full potential. And while some scene transitions were too fast, at other times the pacing was awful and slow.

"4071",4.5,"  At a time where critics complain about reboots, sequels, and cinematic universes, and the audiences that eat up these corporate movie ventures, I am saddened to see this movie failed to draw in a large sum at the box office. An incredibly unique sci-fi film led by all female talent, playing smart, strong scientists all helmed by an exceptionally talented director who displayed his ability in Ex-Machina, this movie should have been everything we wanted. But it didn't seem to fill the gap it sought to fill, and the studio lacked faith in the film to even give it an international wide release. But, I recommend it. See this movie. It is a disturbing, at times scary, smart sci-fi movie that fills that need that movies like Alien have created. It isn't perfect, but hardly a film is and it is definitely worth the watch for the novelty of seeing something original.","Annihilation",4071,3.8,-0.7
"4072",5,"  If you like movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, or Intersteller, you'll love Annihilation. A movie with more questions than answers, that will have you hunting around message boards for more clues. Fantastic soundtrack, performances, cinematography, and story.","Annihilation",4072,3.8,-1.2
"4073",3.5,"  The condensation of three books worth of material will necessarily exclude things, but this movie excluded something that I thought was crucial to the books, hence the 3.5 stars. Bear creature was awesome, and upon rewatching I might add another 0.5 stars - It's metaphors are still sinking in.","Annihilation",4073,3.8,0.3
"4074",2,"  Un finale ridicolo in una sceneggiatura molto debole. Buone le musiche e la fotografia","Annihilation",4074,3.8,1.8
"4075",4,"  Critics are by and large on board with Annihilation. Audiences however have been more split. Even the people I know personally are coming out strongly either for or against it. Normally, those are the kind of movies that I find myself feeling in the middle about. You know, the movies that people say ""You either love it or you hate it, there is no middle ground!""? Yeah, those are the sort of thing I almost always end up giving a five or six out of ten. But with this one? I fall very, very firmly on the side in favour of Annihilation. I did love it.Aesthetics is a big part of that, I'm not gonna lie. I'm also digging the chimeric creature design I've seen on Netflix so far this year (in both this and The Ritual). But the philosophical stuff is what really does it for me. Annihilation approaches its context in a completely original way, and I for one feel richer for having seen it.","Annihilation",4075,3.8,-0.2
"4076",5,"  It is rare for me to see a movie in theaters. However my girlfiriend and I both watch this movie and absolutely loved it. the sci-fi/thriller/horror themes were backed up by the visuals and universe created during the run time. I enjoy trying to figure out a movie as it goes and Annihilation catered to the need and then some. scientific minds will love this movie and its VARYING twist.","Annihilation",4076,3.8,-1.2
"4077",2,"  Annihilation had a concept that although it was very interesting, it didn't do much to help save this movie from being a beautiful-looking, poorly-paced mess that went all over the place with asking more questions than answering them which was really bothersome and almost none of the characters to care for. It's better than Arrival though.","Annihilation",4077,3.8,1.8
"4078",4,"  visually stunning with fascinating, thought provoking material. pacing was slow at times but deliberate and rewarding in the end.","Annihilation",4078,3.8,-0.2
"4079",3.5,"  The movie was extremely strange, in the best way possible, visually, it was astounding. The effects were A+. However some parts were a little eerie, and the music was okay.","Annihilation",4079,3.8,0.3
"4080",5,"  Interesting subject, and the way the develop the story is quite good, kept me going on whats coming and the graphics are fantastic, kudos to audiovisuals","Annihilation",4080,3.8,-1.2
"4081",1,"  One of the worst movies I have ever seen.","Annihilation",4081,3.8,2.8
"4082",0.5,"  Stop calling movies with zero to mediocre science behind them ""Science Fiction""!!","Annihilation",4082,3.8,3.3
"4083",5,"  If you only saw the trailer for ""Annihilation"" you'd think it's another shock and shooting horror flick wrapped in a thinly veiled google-deep-dream scifi wrapper. But it is SOOO much better than that. It is a terrifyingly vivid and raw demonstration of what ""life"" is at it's core, and how the tendrils of its outward expression fractal into everything that makes us, kills us, and will replace us. In the film these soul rattling and seemingly urgent concepts are expressed through and alongside the same backdrop of deep-dream surreal beautiful scramblings and Time/space/ego-melting that accompany them when they arrise from high doses of hallucinogens.In other words, if you have taken high doses of hallucinogens and wished there was a film that could accurately portray the beauty and the terror in a way that maintains a meaningful form even into the sober side - watch this film If you have not taken high doses of hallucinogens and wondered what the fuck your druggie friends meant by ""it's like we're all connected man, but like in a fractal way"" then also watch this film.","Annihilation",4083,3.8,-1.2
"4084",4,"  A very interesting and unique movie, with a lot to digest and think about. The trailer was grossly misleading about the context of the movie, which probably hurt it a lot at the box office. I highly recommend watching this one, it is part Arrival, 2001 and Twilight Zone wrapped into one ;)","Annihilation",4084,3.8,-0.2
"4085",1.5,"  Sadly slow and frequently make no sense.","Annihilation",4085,3.8,2.3
"4086",5,"  Mind-bending sci-fi expedition in to a twisted world of spacial anomalies, qauntum distortions and alien visitations.It was a head f*?? but I loved it","Annihilation",4086,3.8,-1.2
"4087",4,"  Awesome movie. Edge of your seat thriller, creepy, scifi, creative thriller.","Annihilation",4087,3.8,-0.2
"4088",5,"  A Very good movie! Interesting and visually awesome. Just a very unique and cool story. A must watch!","Annihilation",4088,3.8,-1.2
"4089",1,"  What a waste of a potentially good sci fi flick! Besides some slow moving scenes here and there and unnecessarily weird flashbacks about infidelity, I was mostly enjoying this movie. Then the final act happened and I realized that this movie was literally about nothing. Nothing at all. Their was no real connection with any of the protagonists and no motivation whatsoever for the antagonists, ie the shimmer and the weird mutations. There was no rhyme or reason to this movie and by the end, you'll be scratching your head not out of a lack of understanding but out of frustration that the answers to the mysteries were so simplistic and nonsensical. I truly can't comprehend why this has such a high critic rating when it is an absolute dud of a movie.","Annihilation",4089,3.8,2.8
"4090",2,"  Another one of those what ifs that could have been so much better with a more experienced director. One of the problems with Garland is that he's idolised as a voice of a generation and so carries a weight of expectation on anything he puts his hand to, along with that there's more a hint of fawning obsequiousness from British reviewers.Ex Machina was relatively tight, set in a confined space with few characters, it did pose some good questions on AI, humanity, and ego, before setting them aside to focus on manipulation and thrills.Annihilation is broader in scope but less interesting, less well structured, and somewhat confused about what it wants to be - tonally it shifts all over the place.It begins with a meteorite hitting earth. It carries a life form that replicates and mutates across species, as well as between plant and animal. Its effects are spreading outwards from the point of impact at an increasing rate, and the edge of its area of influence can be seen as a shimmer. Teams of people have gone into the 'shimmer', but none have ever come out.The one man does, except there's something wrong with him and he's dying. His wife joins up with a team going into the Shimmer in order to get to the source in the hopes that she'll find something that will help.This is all standard fare for Science Fiction - it's kind of The Andromeda Strain meets War of the Worlds meets Contact meets Alien; the basic set up could be told in minutes, but it takes forfuckingever to get its arse in gear. That's a big part of the problem, the film can't decide what tone to take - it starts off as a drama, then tries to switch up gears to being an adventure into the unknown before switching gears again to being a bit more psychological before shifting over to horror and then into some trippy half-bakery.It just doesn't gel as a whole story, it's more a collection of influences strung together in a manner that's less than the sum of its parts.Natalie Portman does well with a character who has to be strong enough to survive but who seems too often to be asked to play her part as over-wrought. She's fearless bringing down sharkgator, but that moment is the only one where she seems in command of herself.Jennifer Jason Leigh rasps her way through things with scene stealing disinterest, which is at least notable. Everyone else is cardboard thin so that by the time they start disappearing one by one, as people in these things are wont to do, it's impossible to care either way.Aside from Sharkgator there's a Cowbear auditioning for a sequel to the Revenant but it fails because it makes a 13yo boy laugh. There's another faux Alien bit that's supposedly gory, but again the boy sees the fakery a mile off and is duly unimpressed. If any of these three scenes were supposed to be thrilling they utterly failed, there's not an iota of tension to the hohumness of the endeavour.This isn't so much a deliberately slow-paced film as a low energy one consumed by indecision.","Annihilation",4090,3.8,1.8
"4091",5,"  I thought this movie was amazing. I would label it as a sci-fi horror. It was definitely creepy at times.","Annihilation",4091,3.8,-1.2
"4092",3,"  Ive never felt more uncomfortable walking out of a movie. There isn't a lot of happy moments where you can stop and breathe you just have to take its all at once. The world inside the shimmer is both, beautiful and terrifying. The visuals are stunning, just incredibly done, but it can become very depressing at times.","Annihilation",4092,3.8,0.8
"4093",5,"  There's a lot to love about the film Annihilation, but I think my favorite thing about it is Poe Dameron is married to Queen Amidala. But seriously, go see it. It's fucking awesome. And I may now be in love with Natalie Portman.","Annihilation",4093,3.8,-1.2
"4094",5,"  Great syfy thriller movie keeps you guessing until the end even after the movie ends. Great acting script and plot","Annihilation",4094,3.8,-1.2
"4095",3.5,NA,"Annihilation",4095,3.8,0.3
"4096",0.5,"  This movie believes that being deep is best accomplished by being boring and ambiguous. It has a simplistic plot and inner conflict better suited for an action movie, but trades entertaining special effects for eye-candy special effects that we're all sick of seeing by now. I will not spoil the film by revealing the central conceit it is trying to get across, but I will say that its main idea is utter nonsense, and something I would have expected to show up in one of those teen dramas that pretends to be deep at some point in the third act. Portman phones her part in, and no one else is much better. The camera makes bold moves for the sake of making them and never really asks whether the move was necessary. It's boring, it's long and it ultimately gives a moral that would be laughed off a fortune cookie. One of the worst movies I have seen all year.","Annihilation",4096,3.8,3.3
"4097",1,"  The premise of this movie is great and had so much potential. But the script is appalling and the characters completely crap. Every sentence is designed to be dramatic and emotive which eliminates the sense of disbelief required for a sci-fi because it requires the characters to deviate in behaviour so far from what their roles would require. For example, nobody ever had a monkey on a rope. Not even once.","Annihilation",4097,3.8,2.8
"4098",4.5,"  Still feels it like Ex-Machina. I like visual the ending, it's psychedelic..","Annihilation",4098,3.8,-0.7
"4099",0.5,"  Poorly written and acted film, trying to play the awkward 'diversity' card. Leans heavily on Shiite CGI as the narrative loses direction and hope of cohesion. Haven't seen anything quite this dumb in some time. Perhaps the book is decent but that didn't carry through. Alex G certainly hacked this one - which is unfortunate as his previous work has shown promise. Contrived, shallow and really struggles to convey a decent message. Mass-market plebs and film critics with base intellect may gravitate toward it in their confusion.","Annihilation",4099,3.8,3.3
"4100",4.5,"  This is a damn good movie! Intelligent, well told scifi, with amazing performances and visual effects! Go watch it!","Annihilation",4100,3.8,-0.7
"4101",2,"  Great potential regarding a long term existential angle backed up by science. Due to lack of character development the overall impression deteriorates and the end doesn´t have as much impact as I´d hoped for.","Annihilation",4101,3.8,1.8
"4102",2.5,"  LIke the director's previous film, Ex Machina, Annihilation is very competently directed with amazing visuals, but considers itself to be a much more cerebral film than it actually is. Thankfully, it takes a lot of liberties with the source material however, making it much more enjoyable to watch.","Annihilation",4102,3.8,1.3
"4103",1,"  Seriously one of the worst films I have ever seen. So bad, I can't be bothered to work out what the pretentious deeper meanings are meant to be. It's just not worth the effort. Characters are flimsy and the ludicrous giant crocodile makes Thunderbirds' Attack of the Giant Alligators look like an Oscar-winning classic. The ending is dismally predictible and no doubt a desperate attempt to make the whole witless morass seem vaguely intelligent and meaningful. Which it isn't. Do not waste two hours of your life on this cesspit of a movie....","Annihilation",4103,3.8,2.8
"4104",1,"  Rotten all the way! Utterly meaningless self-indulgent filmmaking. The Tomatometer is probably talking about a different film!","Annihilation",4104,3.8,2.8
"4105",0.5,"  This by far is one of the most dumbest movies I've ever seen.","Annihilation",4105,3.8,3.3
"4106",5,"  This is Film-Art at it's best.","Annihilation",4106,3.8,-1.2
"4107",3,"  The visuals are psychedelic and there's a sense of eerie suspense that pervades nearly every minute of screen time.","Annihilation",4107,3.8,0.8
"4108",3.5,"  good movie overall... don't know why my caps are on?Anyway it did leave a couple of questions1. why didn't they just take a ship or a tank to get where they wanted to go?2. I'm not sure exactly what happened at the end.. anyway it was interesting and spooky","Annihilation",4108,3.8,0.3
"4109",3.5,"  As much as I wanted to love this it was OK at best. Portman was great and the movie was well made, but the story just ended up weird.","Annihilation",4109,3.8,0.3
"4110",0.5,"  Wtf, there was barely a point to anything anyone did and they worried more about someone's affair than the shimmer that was consuming existence...stupid writing mixed with awesome visuals. I wish I could have watched it in a foreign language so that I could pretend it made sense.","Annihilation",4110,3.8,3.3
"4111",0.5,"  No words to describe just how bad this movie is.","Annihilation",4111,3.8,3.3
"4112",5,"  Possibly one of the best movies Iv seen in a long time. Had me on edge the whole way through.","Annihilation",4112,3.8,-1.2
"4113",3,"  As a person who had read (and is a big fan of) the book, I felt torn. If you have not read the book, go ahead and see the movie. The production design is remarkable, the actors are truly great, the scores are harrowing and on point; all in all, as a movie alone, it's an excellent movie.But, if you've read Vandermeer's book, you would probably dislike or even hate the movie (as I do). Alex Garland was one of my favorite directors, and I couldn't wait to see this movie after hearing that he will be making the adaptation of the novel. And now I don't know what to believe anymore.It's basically him saying to VanderMeer ""I love your book and I'm going to make a movie based on it. But let me change this... and this... and this... You know what? Screw the book. I'm going to make my own watered-down version of it. The book is going to be a trilogy? Nah, one is good.""Some movies are loose adaptations of some books. But I've never seen one that is as drastic as this one. Understandably, it's a highly unfilmable book (How? Read it and you'll understand.) But if it's going to be a very loose adaptation, don't use the same title as the book maybe?On top of that, there's the issue with distributing the movie, with all the Paramount and Netflix things making the movie unavailable in theatres outside of the US.I'm not really sure how much the rating should be. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Not after knowing that the book is so much more enticing, suspenseful, and poetic.","Annihilation",4113,3.8,0.8
"4114",1,"  That was not the book. Please just wait for a cable showing.","Annihilation",4114,3.8,2.8
"4115",0.5,"  If you are a Liberal, you will no doubt enjoy this movie. If not, you will have no idea what was going on.","Annihilation",4115,3.8,3.3
"4116",3.5,"  The film is lengthy, there are some scenes which totally bores you. While the rest of it, is a complete mind fuck. Never knew science could be so eerie. It's a fresh take for sci-fi horrors.","Annihilation",4116,3.8,0.3
"4117",1,"  I'm not sure why this is even titled Annihilation.There are hardly any similarities with the book, the biggest similarity being that Area X exists. Characters, events, ending - all different. If you've read the book, do NOT watch this horrible movie adaptation.","Annihilation",4117,3.8,2.8
"4118",3.5,"  Like 2001, Possession, and Mulholland Drive it was good until it got stupid.","Annihilation",4118,3.8,0.3
"4119",4,"  As a movie on its own rights is good fun with well-told story and even better designs and visuals.But as a fan of ""Southern Reach"" books, I can't understand how Jeff VanderMeer , author of the books, who was as well involved in making the movie, could allow for such changes, The story shown in the movie has nothing to do with the first book and the way it ends makes it impossible to screen the two other parts. Unless they will make them totally different than books.I can only think about ""Solaris"" but at least as far as I know Stanislaw Lem didn't like the way they have changed the whole story.Calling this movie ""Annihilation"", for me, is purely marketing trick. Before watching it I was hoping somebody will make a movie based on another great book by VanderMeer, ""Borne"", but now, if it was the same approach as ""Annihilation"", I will stick with the book.Why change a great into good?","Annihilation",4119,3.8,-0.2
"4120",2,"  The high ratings from RT critics makes me VERY suspect! I really wanted to like this movie.. I really tried. The consensus from all 5 of my companions was the same. We didn't care about any one of the characters, Not even the visuals could save it. A movie about nothing","Annihilation",4120,3.8,1.8
"4121",2,"  So disappointed. The first half if the movie is great, and it seemed to be going in an interesting direction. Acting was good and some scary moments. But then everything just went crazy and the story fell apart into the complete ridiculous. In the midst of the madness though, the 'twist' ending did somehow manage to still be completely predictable. The most frustrating thing for me however was that to me a lot of the bulk of the story could have had scientific basis, (aside from the ending) but the explanations given are completely ridiculous and beyond any realm of possibility. Sci fi needs to have science, and just because this movie features scientists who use the right buzz words, does not ground the plot in any actual science. So frustrating to start watching a movie that seems brilliant initially and for the ending to just be complete crap.","Annihilation",4121,3.8,1.8
"4122",4,"  Not just an action/adventure/sci-fi movie. This explores the effects of exposure to the unknown and doesn't wrap it up neatly or give us pat answers. Hard to describe without dropping spoilers, and spoilers wouldn't help anyone understand the movie better anyway. May need to be seen more than once to be understood - and even that may not make things clearer. Definitely worth the ride, though.","Annihilation",4122,3.8,-0.2
"4123",2,"  Don't see it hungover -- loud, bright, corny, and twenty minutes too long.","Annihilation",4123,3.8,1.8
"4124",0.5,"  This was - and I say this without hyperbole - the worst film I have ever seen.","Annihilation",4124,3.8,3.3
"4125",0.5,"  Dialogues and 90% of movie is completely weak. Visual effects are so-so. Script and whole story is not awfully bad, but I can't say it's good. Long story short please don't watch this unless you wanna see someone's bad trip.","Annihilation",4125,3.8,3.3
"4126",2,"  I can't give this movie any more credit, because it's such a letdown from the world and atmosphere of the book. My greatest disappointment is that no worthier movie will be possible for the Annihilation series for many years because of one flagrantly disloyal adaptation. A cool aesthetic? Yes, but Garland trades a consuming ambiguity and communal breakdown for a shallower, more traditional ambiguity and some cheap monster moments. The difference as I imagine it is between a monster with the mystique of Jaws and a Prometheus of plentiful but inconsequential horrors.","Annihilation",4126,3.8,1.8
"4127",5,"  Cinco estrelas não são duficientes, está muito à frente do seu tempo. Do melhor que já foi feito nas últimas décadas.","Annihilation",4127,3.8,-1.2
"4128",0.5,"  Utter shite. Also ruined by SJW and feminist dogma. The unrealistic diverse cast actually ruins the film. Plus 5 wammen who are the action heros is way too forced.Skip it and save 140 mins of your life to do something useful.","Annihilation",4128,3.8,3.3
"4129",5,"  Annihilation is a rare treat for those that love exciting and intelligent movies. It is full of beautiful imagery, bad ass women, and perhaps the most terrifying antagonist I have ever seen. Just like the primordial soup that gave birth to life on Earth, the ""shimmer"" has arrived by accident and is driven without logic or meaning towards a will to live. The expression of this idea is marvelously executed and a feast for the eyes. I've seen it twice and both times the theater was nearly silent. Everyone was glued to the screen and waiting with bated breath as the story unraveled chaotically, mysteriously, perfectly in front of us.","Annihilation",4129,3.8,-1.2
"4130",1,"  Honestly, I don't UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH A BAD MOVIE GET SO MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS. NOT ONLY IT'S PREDICTABLE AND BORING, BUT THE CGI AND CINEMATOGRAPHY IS HORRENDOUS - FAR WORSE THAN, SAY, IN nETFLIX'S OWN mUTE.","Annihilation",4130,3.8,2.8
"4131",4.5,"  Alex Garland supplies us with yet another mind-blowing cinematic movieexperience in Annihilation. The visuals and camera shots are well thoughtout. The friend I saw the film with, even noted that things looked like theywere often being viewed through a lenses or a window which was interesting.The story is gripping, which is impressive for a movie with very little actionsequences involved altogether. Natalie Portman also gives an exceptionalperformance, one I didn't know she was capable of alongside Oscar Isaac.","Annihilation",4131,3.8,-0.7
"4132",4.5,"  Face the real Fear! the ending is amazing","Annihilation",4132,3.8,-0.7
"4133",2.5,"  Pretty to look at, otherwise unremarkable","Annihilation",4133,3.8,1.3
"4134",5,"  A very fresh area of sci-fi exploring concepts of alien conciousness by evolution. The characters were very believable, great acting.","Annihilation",4134,3.8,-1.2
"4135",4.5,"  One of the most intelligent thought provoking sci go movies I've seen..not hyperbole or recency bias..genetics..and humanity's unstoppable need..to self destruct ourselves..cannot wait to have intelligent conversations with someone about this movie endlessly","Annihilation",4135,3.8,-0.7
"4136",2,"  Why did scienstist act so stupid?","Annihilation",4136,3.8,1.8
"4137",4,"  Weird sci-fi concoction. Unusual, challenging and scary. Me likes.","Annihilation",4137,3.8,-0.2
"4138",3,"  A thinking mans movie with some stunning visauls and great music that could have been fantastic but unfortunately lacks a good setup and suffers from the pacing being off at more than one point.","Annihilation",4138,3.8,0.8
"4139",4,"  Annihilation straddles the line between cerebral film-making and the plain bizarre. The result is consistently engaging and thought-provoking even when its own obscurity works against the story.","Annihilation",4139,3.8,-0.2
"4140",3.5,"  Annihilation could have been a great sci-fi but a few things hold it back from achieving it's potential. The plot follows a group of scientists as they enter into a mysterious shimmer to try and find it's cause, well aware that no expedition has yet returned, with the exception of Lena's husband. The cast do a great job throughout the film with Natalie Portman unsurprisingly being the standout performer as Lena.Visually, this is a stunning film. The CGI might not be the best but considering the films moderate budget but a good enough job is done to create a world that feels alive and coupled with films soundtrack, quite haunting. Extra kudos goes to the bear, which is responsible for the most tense and chilling moment throughout this film.Unfortunately though, there are couple of faults that stop this from being great. Firstly, there are several flashbacks into Lena's past that don't really work. They tell a backstory that doesn't really need to be told and as a result just feel like unnecessary padding to help drag out the runtime. The biggest issue though is the ending. Whilst the very last scene is well done, the build up to the events didn't really work for me. The climax felt quite out of place with the rest of the film and verging on pretentious.Despite these flaws though, there is still plenty here to keep sci-fi fans amused and make Annihilation a worthwhile watch.","Annihilation",4140,3.8,0.3
"4141",2,"  Belle esthetique mais lent de chez lent. Assez ennuyeux.","Annihilation",4141,3.8,1.8
"4142",4.5,"  A film that managed to cram so much into so little. I would definitely say that a background in science might better serve in your understanding and/or appreciation of this film; however, it is definitely not required.","Annihilation",4142,3.8,-0.7
"4143",1.5,"  The film suffers from continual vacillation between the current storyline and flashbacks. It also significantly lacks scoring. The first rule of science fiction is the mandate to suspend disbelief. This film fails at that task badly.","Annihilation",4143,3.8,2.3
"4144",1,"  Slow, lazy, boring and pretentious.Essentially this movie is about going from point A to point B, with dropping of backpacks whenever possible. Occasional events that happen during journey do not contribute to story in any way. As result both story and its conclusion are exceptionally boring and confusing(mild leanings into supernatural, instead of completely plausible scientific explanations, do not help either), as practically nothing relevant have any explanation or even hint at explanation. Few short scenes that give glimpses into events that happen in the Shimmer are not unpacked in any way and serve more as a filler. Only meaningful conversation that even attempts to explain Shimmer lasts about 2 minutes. Rest of them are either recollections of past life or are pointless banter. Neither have nay relevance to story.Annihilation is so open-minded that viewer mind simply shuts down at some point as there is no pieces to connect together. Every time some pattern starts to emerge whole thing takes 180 and goes in completely different direction. Ending is completely disconnected from rest of the movie and as result do not make any sense. If there was some grand idea behind this film, then i fail to see it, even glimpse of it. Its just lazy, relaying on viewer imagination to fill all those huge plot and logic holes in non-existing storyline.After watching thru it 3 times, in attempt to find some hidden meaning, initial reaction of ""What was the point of all this ?"", be it bone jigsaw in front of lighthouse or memory card at old base, did not really change in the slightest. Whole thing can be described in one sentence - ""something something Shimmer, something something lighthouse"".","Annihilation",4144,3.8,2.8
"4145",5,"  captivating and thought-provoking. Love it.","Annihilation",4145,3.8,-1.2
"4146",2,"  inconsistency in this movie is so bad. ex- soldier made so many bad decisions. ""scientists"" which doesn't collect any evidence. only good side are special effects","Annihilation",4146,3.8,1.8
"4147",5,"  such an amazing concept . although it has a slightly slow pacing but everything is worth the mysterious end that leaves you wondering ' what the f did i just watch ?! ' ... Great direction , brilliant cast and just mind blowingly beautiful visuals !","Annihilation",4147,3.8,-1.2
"4148",2.5,"  While I liked the premise of the film. 5 women trekking into a wilderness which as been transformed into an unknown, alien landscape. Following in the footsteps of the men and tech that have gone before them and disappeared. The film, though well acted and visually beautiful, fails to connect with the viewer on an emotional level. It is also super serious in tone but without the emotional weight behind those levels of seriousness, the film comes across as pretentious. Ultimately, the ending falls very flat. The 'what happens now?' questions the director expects the audience to ask turn into 'Thank god that's over, there's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back..."" Disappointing.","Annihilation",4148,3.8,1.3

"4154",1.5,"  I think the ""professional"" critics haven't read or watched enough good Sci-Fi to know what good mystery horror sci-fi should be like. The PC finger prints are all over this pot boiler, it's distracting and unnecessary, enough with the ""Mary Sues"" already. One of the characters points out the glaringly obvious with putting females in combat situations, stating, ""Shit is heavy, can't carry this"".The macguffin was interesting until it became a parody of itself, and reflected badly on everyone involved in this mediocre Sci-Fi romp. One thing is certain, Sci-Fi fans will watch this, because you have to watch, just in case it's one of the few rare gems you might find these days.If you love science in your science fiction, this movie will disappoint. If you love fantasy in your Sci-Fi you might get more out of this than I did. It's not a ""Cloverfield"", but it's certainly no ""Alien"".","Annihilation",4154,3.8,2.3
"4155",4.5,"  Writer-director Alex Garland has always leaned towards intricate ideas that ask a lot but answer little, mainstream audiences be damned. So it's no surprise that Paramount Pictures got cold feet and sold his latest trippy sci-fi to Netflix for international distribution. It's a double-edged sword though: whilst it's great to see Garland's mind-bender relatively quickly after its cinematic release Stateside (a release here would've undoubtedly been delayed), this visually spectacular film would've been an amazing big-screen experience. To attempt a suitably informative plot summary would not only be futile, but would diminish the impact of the narrative and thematic Pandora's box so carefully constructed by Garland (adapting from Jeff VanderMeer's novel). It's as close to undefinable as a movie can get. Suffice to say; however, that we follow a group of complex women - led by Natalie Portman's regret-filled biologist Lena - as they embark into what may or may not be another realm. Toying with time, space and the very fabric of humanity, it is a filmic hallucination that demands your unwavering attention as it subtly weaves in and out of reality, keeping the viewer as off-balance as the leading lady. Moments of pure beauty are juxtaposed against sporadic bouts of visceral terror, the sudden and seamless switching between the two (helped with flawless CGI) maintains a high level of tension until culminating in a hypnotic and unnerving finale that is simply awe-inspiring. The meaning of the climax, as with the movie as a whole, is of course open to interpretation, while the emotional connectivity will depend on one's willingness to ride Garland's wave, but there's no denying the ambition - and dare I say, genius - on display. Annihilation does what every great sci-fi tale should: intrigue, enthral, provoke and challenge.","Annihilation",4155,3.8,-0.7
"4156",3.5,"  Idk how I feel about it. It is okay.","Annihilation",4156,3.8,0.3
"4157",2,"  I wanted to like this movie so much but it was a letdown in so many ways. The plot twist could be seen from a mile away and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know what the hell the Critics were smoking when watching this.","Annihilation",4157,3.8,1.8
"4158",1.5,"  Boring. Waste of acting talent on mediocre script, poorly directed.","Annihilation",4158,3.8,2.3
"4159",4.5,"  This is one of those rare movies that really makes you contemplate what it means to be human. With genetic manipulation from an alien force, this movie serves as a chilling horror as well as a sci-fi thriller. While the beginning of the movie spoils some of the beats it actually plays out better that way in the end because it makes you think of the ways the events were described by the protagonist. Very well done in that aspect, many of the shots I thought were odd choices. For example during scenes of dialogue early on the camera would be too low cutting off portions of their heads, this is a very minute thought for an overall good watch. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about the movie, it's gripping and intense throughout, the main character is not just a typical horror movie character who makes stupid decisions, this character is actually smart and has a military background which serves some use against some genetically altered monsters. I highly recommend this movie for any horror lovers and especially those who movies that provoke thought long after the ending.","Annihilation",4159,3.8,-0.7
"4160",4.5,"  at first this seems like one of those odd ball self funded sci fi movies but it grows on you (pardon the pun). And the (mostly) all woman cast shows that the recent sci fi tv revolution of having female leads and co-leads is finally moving into movies.","Annihilation",4160,3.8,-0.7
"4161",0.5,"  Sick of these DISHONEST reviews by these so-called ""critics"". Hollywood must be getting desperate. This movie was garbage with really bad graphics.","Annihilation",4161,3.8,3.3
"4162",2,"  This film tries to be deep, it tries to be interesting, it tries to be different and It does this all in a bad way. I was looking forward to this movie because I saw that most people liked it and critics loved it. It's a lie everyone, don't waste your time. It's hard to even talk about this film because I got nothing out of it. It has been a while since I've seen a stinker because I research and try to find other opinions and if they are good I watch the film. I tried to be in denial after this movie because I was sad that it wasn't good. I wanted this to be great but It didn't turn out that way. Disappointment is the word that I would describe this movie. It was confusing and unstructured. It's super artsy but it doesn't have a good story or developed characters. The CGI is bad and the editing is decent. People travel from one place to a whole other area in the span of a cut at one point. This is a cinematic clusterfuck.","Annihilation",4162,3.8,1.8
"4163",5,"  As a fan of the novels, I've been highly anticipating Annihilation, and it was worth the wait. This movie changes the narrative more than enough to separate itself from the novel with it's great performances, stunning visuals, interesting and mysterious story, and scares. The film was very enjoyable to watch and pretty immersive, however I did find there was a formula to advance the plot once or twice which became a little noticeable but didn't cause any issues. And similar to the novel, it left viewers wondering and pondering over the film's mysteries and events which will lead into the next film, making it a film to remember for quite a while. Overall, Annihilation is a fantastic film with a strong story and well performed and leaves the viewer desiring for more.","Annihilation",4163,3.8,-1.2
"4164",4.5,NA,"Annihilation",4164,3.8,-0.7
"4165",4.5,"  Visually stunning, beautifully acted and spot on direction and editing, it almost makes me forgive Netflix for Bright, it was so good.. The story reminded me a bit of JG Ballard's novel 'The Crystal World At times surreal, others a human drama and occasionally truly terrifying, it can be difficult to watch some scenes, the tension is so ratcheted up. The presence of both Isaac and Portman show that there is survival after the reprised Star Wars franchise which, for my money are the worst sci-fi movies ever. Now they've made good on the debt to us nerds by being in one of the best.","Annihilation",4165,3.8,-0.7
"4166",2,"  This movie never came together for me.The women did every illogical act except wear stilettos in the woods. The ending that was supposed to chill me was so redundant. I want me 2 hours back. the kettle corn was excellent, though.","Annihilation",4166,3.8,1.8
"4167",1.5,"  very confusing, couldn't understand the ending, waste of time would recommend not to watch!!!","Annihilation",4167,3.8,2.3
"4168",4,"  I can certainly see why this film is so divisive but for my own part I really liked it and I think it's a shame that I couldn't have enjoyed it in the cinema. It's visually stunning, brilliantly acted and a story that follows its own arc and not conventions. The story really pulled me in, it was very thought provoking, clever, tense and I really wasn't sure where exactly it would go next which is refreshing to say. The musical score also helps add to the tension. It is slow paced but it's what the movie needed to slowly unfold the mystery and I didn't feel myself get bored for one moment. The ending is ambiguous and leaves unanswered questions but I think that only adds to the intrigue and fits the overall tone of the film. I won't proclaim this as a masterpiece but it is an amazing film and if Ex Machina was a hit with you, then I'm sure there's a good chance that you may like this too.","Annihilation",4168,3.8,-0.2

"4174",5,"  One of the best science-fiction films in years, Alex Garland directs to shear perfection, with stunning cinematography, an ambitious and mind-boggling script, and terrific performances from Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh prove that this is a film for the ages, get ready to be rocked.

"4176",1,"  If I could give this one-tenth of 1 star, I would. I haven't passionately hated a movie like this in so long. I mean, I am still seething about it 5 days later. I love sci-fi, but this movie was a colossal nightmare. I don't understand the high critic rating. They called this one wrong, and I can't get back two hours of my life. I kept waiting and waiting for the pay off and ZILCH. Atrocious waste of a movie. Natalie Portman's performance is the only positive I have for this debacle.","Annihilation",4176,3.8,2.8
"4177",1,"  Ok it's an audacious movie but in my opinion he is just weird.All actions are wtf, you're not link to the characters, and the end is just waaaaaay to long !You have to be very very very open-minded ! Maybe with an other actress than Nathalie Portmann, people would have rated it as bad as me.","Annihilation",4177,3.8,2.8
"4178",3.5,"  ""Annihilation"" is a swamp of special effects. Nevertheless, at most occasions it manages to look absolutely stunning & colourful. It's obvious that imagination (& post-production department) had to work overtime to create the film's inhabiting world. The film's concepts, though imaginary, are clearly rooted in & explained by the use of biology, geology & psychology. The film reflects life as it is, sometimes mesmerizing & sometimes horrific. The only downsides of ""Annihilation"" are the gimmicky-looking action sequences & the under-development of its characters, an aspect that leaves viewers disinterested about said characters' fate.(Updated from 13/03/2018)","Annihilation",4178,3.8,0.3
"4179",4,"  Annihilation on the surface sounds more violent than it actually is but there are some gore moments like when a woman with a lot of feminine angst takes a machine gun and blows away a giant mutant alligator. Let me tell you if you are ever wondering whether Natalie Portman can handle a machine gun I can answer you the affirmative yes and it is quite cool. Make no mistake, it's an Estrogen pumped film, and with a strong-willed female protagonist that perhaps could win an Oscar as well. Natalie Portman's performance is outstanding and supporting characters did a good job as well. Some of the characters go psycho but I guess that's to be expected when you encounter too many flowers and rainbows. This all-lady team sent out to achieve success 'where no man has gone before' (and achieved success) didn't end too well. They go out to the danger zone to solve the mystery and things take a turn for the worse. The five women collectively hit menopause at the same time on a 'very bad day', and meet stressors such as a Mutant Aligator and Giant Bear with a skull head. This and many other unfortunate events remind us that Dorothy is not in Kansas anymore. The visuals were outstanding. Complete with rainbow anamorphic flares, this scifi film was a visual treat and something different and more interesting than the most recent scifi films. Natalie's CG alter ego is taller than her, I get that everyone wants to be taller but this was a bit much, Natalie is a 'shortie'. The special effects of the alter ego were done well and obviously very high budget. The set design was overwhelmingly cool. Very creative flowers and foliage really added to the environment and feel of the film.Overall I'd say it's good storytelling and the film kept my attention which is sometimes difficult to do with adult ADHD onset so early, so 4 out of 5 stars for an engaging film.","Annihilation",4179,3.8,-0.2
"4180",2.5,"  I always struggle with stories that toe the line between original and weird, and this is one. It was interesting at times but also had me furrowing my eyebrows at others. Beyond that, the directing was good, the acting was average and the score was unsettling, though probably intentionally. While this film is fascinating at times, it is just get a little too abstract for my liking.","Annihilation",4180,3.8,1.3
"4181",5,"  Very well done. Some good and intellectual scifi. Good concepts involving dna.Reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey.","Annihilation",4181,3.8,-1.2
"4182",1.5,"  Decent special effects, but ultimately, it was so lack-luster that I found myself wanting to fast forward to the ending. Not even worthy of Netflixing.","Annihilation",4182,3.8,2.3
"4183",1.5,"  I so wanted to love this movie. I love science fiction. But it was so disappointing. It was as if they said, ""Hey let's make a sci-fi movie that never explains anything, there is no closure and we never find out what anything was."" I kept waiting for something cool to reveal itself - it never did. Just left you hanging.","Annihilation",4183,3.8,2.3

"4187",3.5,"  iT'S AN ALRIGHT MOVIE, VERY GOOD PRODUCTION VALUE AND THE ACTING IS GREAT, JUST THE STORY IS A LITTLE FAR FETCHED IF YOU KNOW AS MUCH BIOLOGY AS i DO. GIVEN THAT, IT'S DEFINITELY AN INTERESTING FILM AND ONE OF THE BETTER ONES i'VE SEEN SINCE 2017.","Annihilation",4187,3.8,0.3

"4190",5,"  Honestly, it scared the crap out of me. It was weird enough and had that intangible ""something"" that had me still thinking about it days later. It's weird because it is a true sci fi and it is about what would happen if a complete (tiny spoiler - don't read the next five words if you don't want a hint................ alien ""something"" fooled with our DNA,............ because that is what the unknown something probably does naturally. It doesn't tell too much about the unknown something, which might make people frustrated, but honestly it doesn't take away from the film because it's supposed to leave you wondering and thinking and putting it together, and it does, not just about what happened, but about what the unknown something is, what might happen next, why, and a lot more. It gives enough info that I wouldn't ever want to encounter this situation, ever. I'd rather encounter a monster from a monster movie, because you might be able to get away from it. But it was the overall idea and the visuals that somehow made me feel really creeped out (in a good way for a scary sci fi). If a movie leaves me still thinking about it for days, it's a good movie. It's unique, it's thought provoking, and it makes you want to know more. I think it explores the topic of what gives a person their true identity, what happens if that gets tampered with, and at what point does someone stop being who they are. That's what creeped me out. It explores stuff that we don't completely understand ourselves, and made me think about things that are almost out of my comprehension. like how complicated a person's body and mind are, what makes me me, and would I still be me if someone shifted stuff around so I'm not the same me or a version of me. Or if someone clones me, would that be me . I can't explain it. I can just say there's a reason it's creepy and it's hard to explain, but it explores something very thought provoking and frightening. It's a shame that they released it on Netflix first. I couldn't believe I'd seen it on Netflix and then realized it was just coming up in the theater. That's pretty jerky for the studio to do to the producer. I'd go see it in the theater, too, just because I think the producer got a raw deal, but I'm still feeling the creeps from it, and not sure I want to have nightmares tonight. If it doesn't scare you, then you don't understand it. The force or ability of the unknown something, though subtle at first, is more destructive than an atom bomb, and sneaks up on you like a really sly predator that gets you to walk right up to it. The only thing I didn't think was deep was the people's characters, but I don't think that is the goal of this type of movie. The movie is making you wonder who people are (in a general sense) anyway, on purpose, so I think character development maybe wouldn't improve the goal. Maybe I'm wrong. It's just my first thought about it. Overall, I would not forget this movie. It left a strong impression on me. It almost seems to me to be a cross between a sci fi, a horror movie and a something just totally unreal, surreal, bizarre, but still mostly a sci fi because it COULD be possible, if there was an unknown entity with this much power, capable of this type of scientific meddling.","Annihilation",4190,3.8,-1.2

"4195",3,"  Alex Garland tries to tap into the essence of Kubrick's ending of 2001 a Space Oddesy. Stunning visuals, loud viseral audio, and questions that go unanswered. We want to follow Natalie Portman characte's journey to find her own answers to what has happened to her husband that just shows up after being away for a year. Mystery surrounds a military mission into the glimmer. A ecosystem that is created after a meteor crashes into a lighthouse. Portman and a group of women scientist take thier turn into the glimmer to try to find answeres. If you are just getting into cerebral sci-fi films then this semi spoon feed flick is for you. The issues that I have with this film is the flash back cut sceens do not add any substance to the story as a whole. Every step of the way we where literally told what is happening in the shimmer...zero mistery. Until the lighthouse ending that makes this films climax worth the wait. Garland's older films out preform his newest attempt on the big screen.","Annihilation",4195,3.8,0.8

"4203",3.5,"  We get maybe a handful of good Sci-Fi films every year and this was one of them. I really enjoyed Annihilation and it shows that Alex Garland is an up and coming film maker w/serious potential. That said, there are some very real problems with it. The casting is iffy. Natalie Portman, Oscar Issac and Jennifer Jason Leigh are competent in their roles but everyone else feels like a hasty decision with zero depth. Brilliant moments that are slow, long - moody cinematic reflections, resembling something that Terrence Malick would do are eclipsed by soapy dramatic encounters and cheesy creature effects. It was definitely worth watching but it's already off my radar as a seriously good Sci-Fi movie.","Annihilation",4203,3.8,0.3

"4209",4.5,"  Gone are the days when alien movies were all about UFO's and aliens wreaking havoc on mankind to conquer earth. After Arrival this is another movie which deals with Alien, Sci-fi topic with intellect. It doesn't blatantly shows the alien to be bad and trying to wipe out a species, but instead it shows in a more scientific way how the alien reacts to the new environment , Earth it is and is dealing with it. The cinematography is awesome and the whole movie is beautiful frame by frame. The story line and the subtle foreshadowing is magnificent. And the background music although a bit techno and futuristic fits in the movie perfectly. A must watch for sci-fi aficionados.","Annihilation",4209,3.8,-0.7

"4212",4,"  They talk too much. And that's a good thing. A new vision on sci-fi themes, a new mature and philosophical way to talk about aliens, horror and unknown.

I get the impression that this would be the type of screenplay book adaptation that one would make if one were high on something, LOL. It is weird, but in a beautiful way, and it does bring something new to the scifi genre. Natalie Portman did a great job in carrying the movie, she was very effective in that role. Anyway, great scifi horror, very innovative. Watch out for that Bear scene, it was one of things that really made this movie unique.","Annihilation",4216,3.8,-1.2

"4218",2,"  I was disappointed while watching Annihilation in the theater last night. My friend watching with me apologized for suggesting it, as she was unhappy as well. With 24 hours of thinking about it, still disappointed. The film meanders, yet doesn't hit enough points to make the degradation of the team apparent. This interfered with my suspension of disbelief, along with the supposed seriousness of the situation. 3 years of missing exploratory teams? No communication once inside? One would suspect the Southern Reach project was run by bottom feeders. I could see the movie compared to 2001 and Apocalypse Now, but the descent to madness isn't plotted out, and the transcendence of the final act isn't impactful. It doesn't work.

"4222",4.5,"  This is one of the most weird and crazy movies that you ever see in these past years, Annihilation is another great acomplishment by the director Alex Garland. He delivers suspense, dazzing visual, an intriguing narrative and compelling moments with a solid leading cast (Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez and Tuva Novotny are great) that involves the public from the beginning to the end. (4,5/5)","Annihilation",4222,3.8,-0.7

"4225",4.5,"  A visually stunning film that initially leaves you utterly confused. This movie tackles various ""self-destructive"" tendencies of human nature and a person's will and effort in trying to change those tendencies. Alex Garland delivers another great flick to the Sci-Fi genre. He effectively immerses us in an intriguing universe, that messes with our psyche. There have been many comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this movie has a much more concrete plot and thought out characters. I thought this movie started off very strong and ended on a comparatively okay note. Annihilation constantly kept my mind churning, while also keeping me guessing on what would happen next.","Annihilation",4225,3.8,-0.7
"4226",3.5,"  Not only are many of the moments in Annihilation completely memorable, but many of the themes and ideas presented within have plenty of artistic and intellectual value that cannot go ignored, but sadly, the film as a whole is nowhere near as perfect as many of its small moments, more often than not exhibiting questionable desicions of rythm and directing, as well as a general feeling that the whole concept of the film is not as smart as it is actually underdeveloped.","Annihilation",4226,3.8,0.3
"4227",2,"  Funny looking at the females walking toward the wilderness, kind of ghost busters. The movie is like a peyote trip completely out of reality.","Annihilation",4227,3.8,1.8
"4228",3.5,"  An ambiguous and mysterious film that deserves your attention with its interesting premise.","Annihilation",4228,3.8,0.3
"4229",4.5,"  There are very few awesome Scifi Horror movies. Very few. I only had one beef with the movie. It was a typical Smart/Dumb scientist trope. It is such a minor flaw. Forgivable. It's like smelling a fart during an opera. It's inevitable, short, and goes away. More importantly, it doesn't take away from the experience.","Annihilation",4229,3.8,-0.7

"4234",3.5,"  ANNIHILATION. I can see why this film would have mixed reviews. It is somewhat dark, somber, bleak, even disturbing and upsetting. Yet, it also was really interesting and well done. It certainly kept my attention. It is not your typical Hollywood feel-good film. If you like a different kind of sci-fi, like Prometheus, you may enjoy this. I dug the musical score too.","Annihilation",4234,3.8,0.3
"4235",1,"  A movie about watching psychedelic paint dry","Annihilation",4235,3.8,2.8
"4236",1,"  Ooooh no no no. Whilst this film has been praised for lofty themes and an all female lead cast playing scientists - admirable and appealing traits - the writer, director and special effects artists are in well over their heads. Bring back the likes of Cronenberg and Lynch!","Annihilation",4236,3.8,2.8
"4237",4,"  Visually awesome; different to to novel but still a great sci-fi.","Annihilation",4237,3.8,-0.2
"4238",2,"  I think I would have appreciated the film a lot more if I had not read the book. Natalie Portman is really good and the story line is definitely interesting. It just didn't follow the storyline of the book whatsoever and that made me really disappointed. It's a good book so I do not see a reason to change it so completely.","Annihilation",4238,3.8,1.8
"4239",3,"  While this Sci-Fi-Adventure comes with a pretty impressive cast, great looking effects and an interesting premise, the last act does not entirely live up to the set-up. You can't say the film doesn't try to bring something new to the table but the slow pace and philosophical aspects of the rather biological problems shown only work to some degree. The ending is as unsettling as weird. You gotta appreciate the film going different ways, and it's certainly as entertaining as challenging, but somehow I expected a little...more.","Annihilation",4239,3.8,0.8
"4240",4,"  Thought provoking, disturbing, and altogether great sci-fi film. Where are all the women in Hollywood praising the all female lead cast? Maybe there weren't enough terrible jokes in it. This movie doesn't treat its audience like idiots which is probably why no one went to see it.","Annihilation",4240,3.8,-0.2
"4241",3,"  The thought process behind the movie carries so much depth that it almost pierces the mind and hangs on like a bloody nightmare. The movie is World apart from other scifi thrill and is terrifyingly thought provoking. However it seems that the ending could have been better or more explicable.","Annihilation",4241,3.8,0.8
"4242",3,"  The story needs work, however good effects.","Annihilation",4242,3.8,0.8

"4244",2,"  Aside from the really cool special effects, this movie was complete garbage. Other than Portman the acting was poor and the story was very weak. I'm wondering how this was certified fresh. Ex machina was excellent. Watch that again and skip this","Annihilation",4244,3.8,1.8
"4245",3,"  I wasn't too interested on first sight. Had nothing to do so I decided to finish this one. It's an interesting story though. I had this ""Last Of Us""(Video Game) vibe until the last couple of scenes. This post-apocalypse feel almost. The atmosphere (Music, sounds) also had me thinking about ""The Last Of Us"" I really liked that. The movie has the viewers questioning a lot of things about life, be it science, religion or just the meaning of life. The surroundings in this movie are very pleasing to the eyes. CG-Wise it was alright, they did a very good job although there were some bits where it could have been much better. The movie did have a few plot-twists, the move ended in an open-ending, left me hanging with a lot of questions, things I still NEEDED to see. They decided to go for a full female-cast (lead roles), characters were diverse had a little backstory to them, we didn't really go too deep, so I don't believe the viewers will care much about them (Everyone excluding Natalie Portman). I like the sci-fi visuals and the interesting mix of the ""post-apocalyptic"" genre. Overall, an alright movie. Recommended to light sci-fi lovers and people who love the ""zombie-esque"" type of movies.","Annihilation",4245,3.8,0.8

"4247",3.5,"  3.5/5 StarsI can see this as a movie you either love or hate. It is a cross between sci-fi and a thriller. It flips back and forth between three different times as it reveals the story to you. And by the end of the movie it feels a bit like 2001 with the ""what the hell is happening here?""Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh gave pretty solid performances. The rest of the crew was meh. The plot kept my interest through and kept me on edge. I'm still not sure what to think of the entire end of he movie.

"4251",2,"  Wow. Netflix has officially become the Buzzfeed of the film world.The lazy attempt to jump on the ""Empowering women in the film industry"" bandwagon is about as flimsy as the plot.So...the plot.The movie opens on Natalie Portman patronising (they'd call this ""mansplaining"" if she had a penis) a class of university medical students, by explaining what a cell is. It then cuts almost immediately to Nat at home crying over her lost husband, as a soppy emotional song plays. We've never met this guy, therefore we don't care who is or what happened to him, and all we know of Nat at this point is that she's patronising and anti-social. Yet for some reason, [insert director / writer names here] seem to think we give a damn. No. We don't. Also, ever hear of the power of silence? It would have been much stronger, emphasising the emptiness of her life. I don't know anything about making movies, but I know that two minutes into a movie that has told us nothing about the characters, I don't give a damn about the characters. This is all a part of the ""sensitive feelings"" bandwagon that needy film makers have been blindly jumping onto lately.Ok. Zombie husband comes home and they both get taken to the base on the border of soap bubble land, at EXACTLY the same point in time that the govt is about to send an ethnically-diverse, all women-squad with zero training (two of the three can't even work out north from south) into the bubble land wilderness to survive alone, Bear Grylls style.They head off into soap bubble land laden with equipment but without the ONLY thing the govt knows (because of zombie husband who Nat herself said looks like a victim of radiation or chemicals) will be effective - biohazard suits and oxygen masks.It also just so happens that Nat has EXACTLY the right qualifications to slot into the Ghostbusterettes team as clueless and utterly untrained team member 5. So, double coincidence / s**tty lazy storyline.Also we have a quick sex scene in which Nat of course is on top.We also see a flashback to a room in which she's getting bluntly interrogated by a man (because men are evil and without feelings).They shoot a crocodile, thankfully without crossing the beams and...annihilating everything.Then they find a video recorder with a film (that has been spliced and edited within the recorder) which extremely clearly shows a man with a slimy creature sliding around in his stomach for over ten seconds, yet one of the ghostbusterettes (plainly not the Bill Murray one who has some sense of reality) laughably, dismisses it as a trick of the light.Nat has a flashback to good times with her husband, to a song that that blatantly rips off The Last of Us soundtrack.Some other stuff happens. It all looks a lot like The Last of Us. I think they go crazy or something and start seeing trippy 90s-style graphics. Someone runs through a cave like a moron and we see lots of Nat looking concerned. There's a room with a guy who forgot to take off his green-screen suit. I zoned out at some point in the second half so not really sure what happens really. There are some cells and fires and it all gets vague and surreal like so many of these films now.So.I'm all for equality. But not when it's being appropriated without sense or logic and being used for no other reason than [insert director / writer names here] want to jump onto the latest social movement bandwagon like zombie lemmings because they're spineless and desperate for praise.Also, there's a trend for movies to be vague and open-ended, especially art-house films. The makers seem to think this is arty. No. It's f**ing lazy and shows you don't give a damn about your audience.This movie will probably do really well because social media is conning people into thinking garbage is good for them. But thankfully, history will be much less kind to nonsense like this.","Annihilation",4251,3.8,1.8
"4252",5,"  A movie you will only fully understand if you'e aware of the Jungian psychological framework and themes at play (such as ego, the shadow self, archetypes, collective unconscious etc). This is a fascinating visual trip into the unconscious mind. Unfortunately, some reviewers are unaware of the symbolism being used and are unable to interpret the film correctly which leads to them thinking the film ''doesn't make sense'' - the fear this film was 'too intellectual' for cinema release worldwide was clearly a valid concern. A brief introduction to Carl Jung's Depth Psychology will set you up to enjoy this masterpiece.","Annihilation",4252,3.8,-1.2

THE MOVIE LEAVES SOME QUESTIONS UNANSWERED SO BE PREPARED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS ONE AFTER IT'S DONE. OVERALL A VERY INTERESTING AND CAPTIVATING SCI-FI FILM.","Annihilation",4260,3.8,-0.2
"4261",5,"  Honestly, it scared the crap out of me. It was weird enough and had that intangible ""something"" that had me still thinking about it days later. It's weird because it is a true sci fi and it is about what would happen if a complete (tiny spoiler - don't read the next five words if you don't want a hint................ alien ""something"" fooled with our DNA,............ because that is what the unknown something probably does naturally. It doesn't tell too much about the unknown something, which might make people frustrated, but honestly it doesn't take away from the film because it's supposed to leave you wondering and thinking and putting it together, and it does, not just about what happened, but about what the unknown something is, what might happen next, why, and a lot more. It gives enough info that I wouldn't ever want to encounter this situation, ever. I'd rather encounter a monster from a monster movie, because you might be able to get away from it. But it was the overall idea and the visuals that somehow made me feel really creeped out (in a good way for a scary sci fi). If a movie leaves me still thinking about it for days, it's a good movie. It's unique, it's thought provoking, and it makes you want to know more. I think it explores the topic of what gives a person their true identity, what happens if that gets tampered with, and at what point does someone stop being who they are. That's what creeped me out. It explores stuff that we don't completely understand ourselves, and made me think about things that are almost out of my comprehension. like how complicated a person's body and mind are, what makes me me, and would I still be me if someone shifted stuff around so I'm not the same me or a version of me. Or if someone clones me, would that be me . I can't explain it. I can just say there's a reason it's creepy and it's hard to explain, but it explores something very thought provoking and frightening. It's a shame that they released it on Netflix first. I couldn't believe I'd seen it on Netflix and then realized it was just coming up in the theater. That's pretty jerky for the studio to do to the producer. I'd go see it in the theater, too, just because I think the producer got a raw deal, but I'm still feeling the creeps from it, and not sure I want to have nightmares tonight. If it doesn't scare you, then you don't understand it. The force or ability of the unknown something, though subtle at first, is more destructive than an atom bomb, and sneaks up on you like a really sly predator that gets you to walk right up to it. The only thing I didn't think was deep was the people's characters, but I don't think that is the goal of this type of movie. The movie is making you wonder who people are (in a general sense) anyway, on purpose, so I think character development maybe wouldn't improve the goal. Maybe I'm wrong. It's just my first thought about it. Overall, I would not forget this movie. It left a strong impression on me. It almost seems to me to be a cross between a sci fi, a horror movie and a something just totally unreal, surreal, bizarre, but still mostly a sci fi because it COULD be possible, if there was an unknown entity with this much power, capable of this type of scientific meddling. Ex Machina , by the same film maker, also gave me a real creepy scare. It was also a sci fi, addressing deep subjects with what could be and what would that mean, and what does it mean to be human. I'm not surprised both films were by the same director. He really has a certain flair going on in his films, and I think they are both very well done and very unique and thought provoking for those who are willing to think, and they both scared me more than a monster movie would have.","Annihilation",4261,3.8,-1.2

"4266",3,"  This movie incorporated a lot of interesting science fiction ideas. I tend to like movies that explore metaphysical and psychological questions, as this one does with ambition. In fact, it is a little too ambitious with the clever ideas and doesn't quite wrap things together at the end to my satisfaction, but it was still fun to watch and then debate in the car on way home. The complete lack of realistic planning by the characters or alleged ""organization"" investigating the mysterious shimmer was a big flaw. Strong performances and beautiful cinematography.","Annihilation",4266,3.8,0.8
"4267",5,"  The film ""The shape of water"" brings a romantic talento that goes on in the 60's for me one of the best times to get the story a perfect performance of Sally Hawkins, i saw love for the creature in his eyes a beautiful feeling. With a breathtaking ending that brings peace to the heart. This movie was Oscar winner","Annihilation",4267,3.8,-1.2
"4268",2,"  The trailer is better than the movie, that's for sure. I've said it before so many times that it's become redundant- the critics are an enigma to say the least. I really don't know why this film has gotten such high marks from them because it pretty much leaves you scratching your head at the end. Maybe that's what they look for in these films. But for us average low brow movie goers it's really not that great. Sure wish I had the high IQ that is required to appreciate this film. The critics consensus says ""Annihilation backs up its sci-fi visual wonders and visceral genre thrills with an impressively ambitious -- and surprisingly strange -- exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll."" Where do they come up with this stuff?? Do they even know what they said? Did they really even watch the movie? I have to wonder. 2 stars, only because it kept me interested to see the outcome, which was a disappointment and could have been better.","Annihilation",4268,3.8,1.8

"4270",4,"  I want to start saying that it's amazing how putting female characters makes a movie refreshingly new. This says a lot about our society. But what about the movie? I am not sure. Definitely interesting. Quiet moments mixed with some horror. It kept me wondering what the hell was going on until the end. And then the end came and..... I won't tell how it ends clearly.

"4280",2.5,"  Annihilation is yet another example of a Hollywood wannabe who takes source material, throws it in a blender, adds ingredients from outside the realm of the story, pours half the concoction on the floor, adds more foreign substance and then blends until the story is so liquefied it is unrecognizable from it's beginnings. Go into a dimly lit room, bring the novel Annihilation from Jeff VanderMeer with you, and read a better story than what this mess presents.","Annihilation",4280,3.8,1.3
"4281",4,"  Directed by Alex Garland, Annihilation is a dark sci-fi with a lot of thought provoking moments and disturbing imagery. An unknown presence has appeared, known as a shimmer, many military groups have gone in but none have come out and the area it covers is slowly expanding. When a survivor manages to escape a new group decides to head into the shimmer and discover what is at its root. It's hard to talk about Annihilation without spoiling key plot points and impactful moments so I won't linger on the premise but the whole idea of the shimmer and what we learn within it is extremely thought provoking, unique and great to sink your teeth into and discuss at length.The cast as whole is very solid and Natalie Portman is excellent as Lena, a biologist with prior military experience who is determined to go into the shimmer. Portman is able to portray a strong stoic character whilst maintaining some vulnerability and charisma. Tessa Thompson and Gina Rodriguez also stand out from the crowd of adventurers as Josie and Anya but aren't given much character development so they can be a little one note.The best thing about this film are its visuals. The locations and sets used for filming are excellent and transform you to this dreamlike but also nightmarish version or earth that also surveys to convey a fair bit about the plot. The use of models and puppets in conjunction with good CGI also serves to deliver some very disturbing and unnerving imagery that will stick with you after watching the film.The soundtrack is also appropriately sci-fi with a strangely nauseating sound that reflects the uncomfortable and unpleasant events that unfold and how the characters begin to feel more and more unnerved.There is a subplot that I don't think added much to the plot and the film as a whole but it's not long or too involved so it doesn't detract much from the main narrative. There is also a moment when the title of the film is used which felt very corny to me and should have been left out.Overall, this is one of the best sci-fis I've seen in the last few years and by far one of the most original. After Ex-Machina Alex Garland has proved himself as an excellent sci-fi director and writer and I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future.","Annihilation",4281,3.8,-0.2

"4298",3,"  At this point I'm not really sure how to feel about ""Annihilation"". As far as sci-fi movies go, I feel that this movie has all the potential of being a success. it introduces some really interesting ideas, and throughout the movie there is a thirst for answers that keeps driving you forward. the entire cast did a fantastic job and i want to CONGRATULATE the idea of having an entirely female main cast. The visuals are so really good and the action scenes as well. There is a horror element throughout the movie and some twists that really got me unawares. my only real issue was with the ending. ""Annihilation"" is a movie that requires discussion afterwards and I sure am here for that, because I feel like different people will have different opinions about this movie. It is artistic sci-fi and I'm sure we need more of these.","Annihilation",4298,3.8,0.8

"4305",2,"  did it communicate with you..AnnihilationThe far fetched idea is not only visible miles away before its station but even the priorities seem to fade off quite early before the scrutiny even begins. A smart adaptation with strict editing on writing section by Alex Garland is possibly the only reason why someone might survive this feature. But unfortunately as much as to-the-point and gripping the screenplay is, the execution lacks better editing as it chews on this slow pill for almost an extra half an hour (the runtime could have easily been of 90 minutes). Natalie Portman is devastatingly good and there is no flinching on that and on her supporting side Oscar Issac justifies its presence on the screen. Even though the genre depicts horror; which is on a head-scratching level (the ""help me"" cries will be enough for your nightmares) where even the elders might cringe on the seat, there are some genuinely good visuals that brightens the tone a bit. Annihilation is without a doubt no short on execution (Alex Garland hits perfect mark on executing the paper on screen) then whether it is to project a heart breaking action sequences or horror chills or even creative creatures but what it fails is on offering a newer perspective, better plotline and a good old tale.","Annihilation",4305,3.8,1.8

"4308",5,"  Alex Garland's follow-up to 2015's fantastic 'Ex Machina' is a fascinating film, even before you sit down and watch it. Firstly, it has had a less than conventional journey to our screens - under the weight of a big budget, and underwhelming test audience reviews, Paramount decided to cut their losses and sell it to Netflix for a fee that doesn't even cover half of it's costs, so sure were they of it proving a box-office bomb. Secondly, Garland refused to bow to pressure and make radical changes to his film, to compromise his vision, in order to ensure studio support. His decision was ultimately entirely justified.Based on the apparently 'unfilmable' Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation focuses on a five-strong, all-female, expedition that sets out to investigate a mysterious 'shimmer' that has appeared, killing everyone who has dared enter it, which threatens to expand rapidly and envelop the planet. Each member of the crew, offers a profession or speciality, that they hope can unravel the mystery, and indeed unravelling takes place, but not of the intended kind - Natalie Portman leads the cast, in a performance as good as any in her back catalogue, which is a low-bar I will admit, but this is easily up to her 'Black Swan' best. There is equally fine support from her cast-mates, including a wonderfully understated showing from Jennifer Jason Leigh.Where the film is a success, is in taking a well established horror formula of having a group of players, picked off one by one by a malevolent force, and using it not as the focus but as a means to an end. The set-pieces are understated and infrequent, though brutal, but necessary to understanding the bigger picture. It is refreshing too, to have a group of characters reacting intelligently to the events surrounding them, and too for a film to have a group of women at it's centre. A rarity for a movie of this type. Yet gender is never referred to throughout. It is not used as a plot device or indeed intended to be some kind of feminist message. Technically, the film is a marvel. Garland has created a vision that is both of this earth, and yet other-worldly at the same time. With natural elements given mutated optics to create a location that plays into the unease felt by the characters the deeper they venture into it. The final sequence, that runs for a good 20 minutes, devoid of dialogue, is as 'out there' as anything I have seen in a studio picture for quite some time. The accompanying soundtrack by Portishead instrumentalist Geoff Barrow, is something else here, complementing a scene that will serve as nightmare-fuel for this viewer for some time to come, not because of any gore or indeed scare, but for the sense of anxiety it creates.You can understand why Paramount bailed on the project, especially after the chance they took with last year's 'mother!' which proved to be box-office poison for them, but their loss is ultimately Netflix's gain. A fine addition to their catalogue and easily one of the best films I have seen this year.","Annihilation",4308,3.8,-1.2
"4309",3.5,"  An acidic bubble taste perfumes the atmosphere in this piece which hues the mind into its world of surreal christening and abstract subjective/dream like wonder. See it and enjoy your thoughts for the rest of the afternoon, you'll be thinking about it","Annihilation",4309,3.8,0.3
"4310",2.5,"  The movie is a little pretentious, but overall is pretty decent. It shares several elements with STALKER. It's well directed, doesn't have lots of pace problems (but theres a huge difference from mid to end), and the visuals/setting are nice, leaving a small impression of something alien, but it's pretty recognizable as a terran woodland.The movie mixes real science with the si-fi, but the end result is a little shallow. The open end just adds pretentiousness. The CGI is pretty bad.Natalie Portman was excellent, but the rest of the cast was a little uneven. And even though the cast is pretty diverse, the best part is that there's ZERO white male representation.","Annihilation",4310,3.8,1.3
"4311",4,"  It doesn't deliver the same artistic impact as Ex Machina did, but Alex Garland's adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer's novel is a unique take at thought-provoking-sci fi's, considering how hollow they seem nowadays, but Annihilation reaches several contexts needed to dig down into the film's purposes, and its several ideas seems to be on schedule behind Portman's character, as well as the rest of its cast members, delivering a beautifully looking and thrilling flick that serves for several viewings.","Annihilation",4311,3.8,-0.2

"4328",4.5,"  Really enjoyed the movie, thought the director made a few weird choices (the framing device and parts of the score). However, this is the movie that people should be seeing right now. Also, this movie has an all-female cast, yet is hearing nothing about this. this is what ghostbusters (2016) should have been, an under-the-radar flick that you don't even realize has an all female cast until halfway through the movie. Plus, the visual storytelling was great. SPOILERS FROM HEre on out:I was a little annoyed how at every found footage scene, they cut to the reactions of the actresses watching the footage, it ruined the immersion for me. Plus, the guitar interludes (in a major key) in the soundtrack was a weird jump in tone; this movie could have learned a bit from whomever scored arrival. overall though, i enjoyed this movie.","Annihilation",4328,3.8,-0.7

"4339",4.5,"  Annihilation - Review (2018)The GoodNatalie Portman is Phenomenal, she is fantastic in quieter, more typical emotive scenes. Alex Garland's Fantastic Direction and his Smart, Thought-Provoking Script, in a lot of ways this is what Prometheus and Alien Covenant should of been:Â a tense, character-driven sci-fi thriller that prods and pokes at the nature of creation in a wildly unexpected way.The Fantastic Supporting Cast - Tuva Novotny, Gina Rodriguez and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the more fleshed-out members of Lena's unit, while Tessa Thompson's rather forgettable physicist character conversely feels disappointing underdeveloped.Rodriguez is awesome as the hot head Anya and Leigh brings every bit of skill to the table you'd reasonably expect.Oscar Isaac isn't in it much but hhe makes scenes matterEven knowing the certain fates of certain characters its still very suspenseful, the action is great enought to make you forget that person will die or not. The disturbing effects of what the Shimmer does to the human body.The Visual Effects are breathe taking and the best so far of the year. Its a fantastic Slow burn with a great Atmosphere Rob Hardy fantastic cinematography Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow fantastic Musical Score The totally insane 3rc act with a fantastic ending The BadThere's a side plot with Portman's Character and a professor that is understandable of why its in the film, but it didn't really need to be.Overall: This is one of the smartest and original Sci-fi films to come out in awhile, that deserves more love.Overall Grade: A","Annihilation",4339,3.8,-0.7

Really more of a dark psychological art-house thriller than pure SF, annihilation is CONSTANTLY fascinating, slowly revealing the both the plot and the character's psychological background.

I didn't like the movie at all, and sure it was something unique, (Well, not really, considering that it followed Arrival's concept) but it really just missed the mark for me. THe story had very little direction, the cinematography seemed off in most scenes, the acting wasn't the greatest, and most of the characters were bland and annoying to watch.","Annihilation",4396,3.8,1.8
"4397",1.5,"  Some beautiful and unique imagery, unfortunately completely marred by terrible pacing and dialogue. Brief scares interspersed with huge swaths of nothing. Predictable ending.Sci-fi, nothing. This is just a rote horror movie.","Annihilation",4397,3.8,2.3
"4398",2,"  MEh, this movie bites. Pacing sUcked, diALoque was lame, no character devolpment.","Annihilation",4398,3.8,1.8
"4399",5,"  This movie has action and mystery and makes you think. I highly recommend this film. It is one of my favorites.","Annihilation",4399,3.8,-1.2
"4400",4.5,"  This film was such a brea of fresh air. Five lead female cast, and not a word in the advertising to market from tHis. There is really something to say about the state of film today when a brainless film like black panther can rake in a bill, and a great film like this barely breaks even. Anyway, for me, this film stands out mostly for its beautiful shots and gorgeous visuals. And not just the images themselves but the way shots are framed and composed. A good example of this would be when they are starring at the muril of death in the empty pool. Everything from the composition of the shots to the griZzly images seen are masterfully done. Some of the acting left a bit to be desired. Natalie portman was typical natalie portman but stil very servicable and quite great In some of the sc nes with less dialogue. All in all the performances of all of the characters were appropriate in the service of the story. Garland who Directed ex machina has a great talent for pacing his films out and sprinkling in just the right amount of back story to help flesh out characters but not at the expence of dragging down the story. At no point does the film lull, and there wEre no action scenes that felt inserted just to get teens to look up from their cell phones (black panter, wonder woman) the ending of the film doesnt tie anything up more neatly than it needs to. This is a film that respects your intellegence. This is a film that understands that the true substance of fiction lies in the personal interpretation of the veiwer. That is a rare thing to see on the big screen these days.","Annihilation",4400,3.8,-0.7

"4402",1,"  Very low energy, poor pacing. The dialogue is stale, stilted, painfully awkward. It appears that they went through multiple drafts and did not make sure that the end product was coherent. There are decisions made by the characters which assume the audience is very unintelligent. ""preachy,"" but not offering any vision or theme. i cannot find anything positive about this film.","Annihilation",4402,3.8,2.8
"4403",1.5,"  Not even close to the depth and interest of the books. Just a jump fest Which somehow managed to get Natalie Portman on board. Yuck.","Annihilation",4403,3.8,2.3

"4405",4.5,"  This is the movie I've been waiting for, very psychedelic visual effects. Reminded me of Lovecraft's The Colour out of Space, but even better. Encapsulates the fear of change.","Annihilation",4405,3.8,-0.7
"4406",4.5,"  a positively disturbing movie that lingers for days. I highly RECOMMEND it.","Annihilation",4406,3.8,-0.7
"4407",1,"  Jennifer Jason Leigh offers a completely vacant performance opposite of Natalie Portman's relatable character. information about each character is forced fed to the audience rather than occurring organically, revelations about the Shimmer come without reasoning as if the characters had read a informative pamphlet. The ending was forecast rather than foreshadowed, as in the books. Overall, wait to watch this movie until it is free on-demand or included with another streaming video subscription.","Annihilation",4407,3.8,2.8

"4418",0.5,"  DUMBEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME ""Annihilation""This highly praised movie from professional movie critics makes me wonder if they literally saw this film on drugs. Annihilation was boring, stupid; and oh did I mention - boring?They advertise this movie as a horror flick, but I thought horror flics are supposed to not put your audience to sleep - literally.I knew the film started off on the wrong foot when Natalie Portman's character, Leena, explained to a small room of university students, that ""one cell turns into two, then two into four, and four into eight."" Of course, these students are surprised because apparently, the elementary school they attended never taught them basic biology. I mean, is that really how you want to show how smart your main protagonist is? Could you imagine watching Ghostbusters and having Egon explain to you that water is wet because it's a liquid?Ugh.The movie just gets dumber and dumber by the minute from there.I'm going to give some spoilers here because it's really waste of time to watch. There are so many logical loopholes in it, the plot shouldn't exist..The premise revolves around a comet that crashed into a lighthouse and created a rainbow bubble around it the military called the shimmer. The military sent soldiers into the shimmer for the past three years, of which none returned alive. That is of course, until Leena's husband returns, dying, and not himself. The shimmer is seen as a threat to civilization by the military as it is expanding, and in a few short months, it could swallow nearby towns, cities, then the United States.So of course, the logical thing to do would be to drop a bomb on the lighthouse, right? Not in this world of snowflake filmmaking.The logical thing to do for these screenwriters is to send an all-woman team of scientists, not soldiers, into the shimmering, to see what's going on. Because sending in alpha-male soldiers didn't work before.....And bombing the alien lifeform that threatens civilization is just out of the question. Because, you know, this is all about woman power.The women literally walk into the shimmering, it's not a forcefield, and it gets even more ""treehuggerish"" from there. One by one, they get picked off by the alternative reality they walk into. Apparently, the shimmering is your ultimate GMO, blending human DNA with plant DNA, and possibly other animal DNA. Everything is crossbreeding in the shimmer without any hanky-panky. Two of the girls get killed by some type of oversized bear-dog that can literally roar, ""help me."" Another girl submits to the shimmer and turns into a flower tree. And the last woman goes into the lighthouse, evaporates into a colorful rainbow.In the end, Leena finds out her husband killed himself with a fire grenade and that the guy who came back is a clone. She also confronts a clone of herself in the lighthouse, that is so good at duplicating her looks, it actually even duplicated her clothes too, not a nude version. Usually, clones can only duplicate bodies, not clothes, right? Leena and her clone engage in a modern dance struggle/fight. I'm not even joking there, it's really stupid. Then she kills her clone with a simple fire grenade and runs out of the lighthouse. The clone incinerates, along with everything the shimmer created.Leena is later interviewed and asked if the aliens were here to hurt us, she answers,""No."" Even though for three years, soldiers, her friends, and her husband, went in and all got killed. She then is asked if the alien is carbon-based, and she answers, ""No."" Again, stupid.... because apparently, everything the shimmer created burned down.The if the movie doesn't get any dumber, Leena meets with her cloned husband. Apparently, everything the shimmer created was destroyed when it died, except for the cloned husband. And when she hugs her cloned husband, both their eyes glow and the screen fades to black.And that people, is the dumbest movie of the year.Annihilation is based upon a book that apparently sold pretty well. So well, that hardly anyone lined up to see the movie.","Annihilation",4418,3.8,3.3
"4419",2,"  Pretty dull movie. They did a fantastic job with the previews to suck people in but a terrible job delivering a quality movie.","Annihilation",4419,3.8,1.8
"4420",1.5,"  After reading Annihilation by vandermeer I was excited to see this film, unfortunately the film is no where near the caliber of the book. The movie I saw was not the story I read and was a total disappointment. Its another example of an excellent book being altered and made into a poorly crafted movie. If alex garland had bothered to stay true to the original authors story he could have had a good film, instead he made a mediocre hollywood horror story. Not worth your time or money, read the book it is brillant!","Annihilation",4420,3.8,2.3
"4421",4.5,"  Dark sci-fi with great acting. cgi is not over-the-top-- blends in nicely to give the film a realism that has been missing as of late.","Annihilation",4421,3.8,-0.7
"4422",2,"  They created a beautiful world with tons of potential. The 5 person squad wasn't believable. Felt like they left a lot on the table. Really FELL apart at the end. Last 10 minutes or so felt like a graphics card benchmark/TESt. Wasted opportunity is what it felt like.","Annihilation",4422,3.8,1.8
"4423",3.5,"  I really loved the book and, sadly, this was not nearly good as the books. i would say go ahead and see it. the visuals and sound design are fun but some of the supposedly scary parts made people in the theater laugh out loud. so see if it you're bored not if you are a fan of vandermeer or the new weird movement.","Annihilation",4423,3.8,0.3
"4424",3.5,"  Annihilation is an intense, thought-provoking sci-fi film that doesn't shy away from big ideas. The superb atmosphere created in the first two acts will draw you in and the third act will either really work or really bomb for most viewers. A worthwhile view for fans of sci-fi that delivers plenty of mystery, thrills, and thoughts to dive into.","Annihilation",4424,3.8,0.3
"4425",5,"  I thought the movie was smart and very entertaining. I feel sorry for those who cant follow it or just dont get it.","Annihilation",4425,3.8,-1.2
"4426",4.5,"  A unique sci-fi that brings together science and the complexities of the human soul. In trying to understand the unknown, sometimes we lose sense of what we thought we knew, and this movie brings you through that journey.","Annihilation",4426,3.8,-0.7
"4427",4,"  Jesus movie theaters are doomed. Well, perhaps not theaters themselves. I'm sure Disney will provide plenty of Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars movies to keep the lights on. No, I mean moviegoers are doomed. We are going to an age where any serious material, such as arthouse horror or hard science fiction will go to Netflix or other streaming services to die. Some point out that such services could save dying genres such as these, but time will surely tell.In either case, we have another example of hard science fiction failing to connect - Annihilation. Annihilation is the story of an alien ""invasion"" that really isn't an invasion per-se, but an infection. After an alien anomaly lands near the southern US coast and continues to expand, the US government sends teams of soldiers and scientists to access the problem and stop it, if possible. One such all-female team includes our battered protagonist (Natalie Portman) whose husband has inexplicably come home after a year of no contact, devoid of personality and memory. If you think you have heard this story before, you would be correct...to a point. Annihilation takes bits and pieces of the serious science fiction of yesteryear with a dash of cosmic horror. Hence why it feels like a curious, but effective cross of The Andromeda Strain, Solaris, Alien, and Predator. What makes it even more interesting is how the infection is not necessarily hostile, it's merely remaking Earth's environment ""in favor of its new matrix,"" as Mr. Spock would say. Natalie Portman is well known for being selective in her roles in recent years and it would be safe to say that she has gambled correctly. She anchors the picture convincingly and reminds us why Hollywood invested so much in her two decades ago. (Jesus I am getting old.) Jennifer Jason Leigh and Oscar Isaac are great as you'd expect, but I have to nod quite a bit to the other members of the crew (Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny) for making their mark in what is an essentially a pretty downbeat film. Alex Garland has impressed before with his work on Dredd and Ex Machina, and his commitment to steady shots and earnest story telling outweighs any temptation for cheap visual flair.As for its financial failure, one could possibly attribute it to the very generic and admittedly awful trailer that advertised it. But it goes further than that. The studio, as usual, panicked that audiences would be too stupid to bother with such a movie and planned to dump it on Netflix shortly after its theatrical release - ensuring that much of its potential audience would not pay for something they could soon see at home for free. Perhaps even more glaringly, no attention was paid to its racially diverse, all-female cast. You would think that in our ""woke"" fuck-Trump-and-the-Patriarchy era, Paramount would fall all over themselves in advertising this. But here's the uncomfortable truth. Studio execs know what audiences refuse to admit to themselves - people only pay for schlock or middle-of-the-road entertainment. They want to see people who look like them blow shit up. And while that's perfectly understandable and even justified, (see my Black Panther review) it still means that movies in multiplexes are going to get dumber and dumber. And we can only blame ourselves.","Annihilation",4427,3.8,-0.2
"4428",0.5,"  The only advice that i can give To those that wana watch this movie is to just pick a DIFFERENT film... This movie is Trippy as shit and if you wannA be tripping balls aftErwards then go for it! The genre is Labled Thriller and magical, its really just creppy. Also If YOU'RE one of those people That like to get high beFore a moviE or Been WANTING to know how it feels like to be high then pleasEeee watch this movie, i GUARANTEE You 100% that YOU'LL be walking out the theater feeling hIgh ??","Annihilation",4428,3.8,3.3
"4429",2.5,"  This film has a classic premise, a director with a clear vision of what he wants the film to be, and about 8 minutes of really great practical gore effects. However, the film is bogged down by an extremely deliberate pace that betrays the danger at hand and forces the viewer to apply extreme focus to remain engaged when there's not a ton there to chew on at times. Plus an ending that will leave a lot of mainstream cinema goers who just want to munch popcorn and forget about the flick 10 minutes after its over scratching their heads and wondering what they'd just seen. I would say that this film deserves a least a try from everyone who enjoys sci fi or horror.","Annihilation",4429,3.8,1.3
"4430",1,"  So bad it's insulting. Cable TV quality, at best.-Canned, predictable dialogue-Lazy camera work, Every scene is a green screen-Several Irritating casting choices-Gives no reason for casting no men in main cast-As of the 75 min mark, when I left the theater, there was not one original idea or addition to the genreBasically it's Neil DeGrasse Tyson meets that bad all-female Ghostbusters knockoff. Really makes you wonder how Rotten Tomatoes and critics gave it such a high rating.","Annihilation",4430,3.8,2.8

"4434",5,"  Had my doubts when i saw trailer, but this film is very very good.","Annihilation",4434,3.8,-1.2
"4435",5,"  Annihilation is many things. Beautiful. Otherworldly. Unsettling. Terrifying. Bizarre. Any many more. But above all it is brilliant. As horror, action thriller, high concept sci-fi and deeply introspective psychological study it works on every level. It's not a movie for the casual filmgoer, or one that is easy to wrap your head around. But for experienced viewers prepared to have their minds blown, Annihilation is a real treat.The premise is that Natalie Portman is Lena, a biologist who has lost her husband and travels into an area of altered reality called ""the Shimmer"" to learn what happened to him. No one knows to expect when they go in, because only one barely conscious person has ever returned. But nothing could prepare them- or the viewer- for what they find inside.They're on Earth. There are touches of the familiar all around. Abandoned shacks, bayous, alligators. But at the same time the inside of the Shimmer is in many ways a beautiful and alien as Pandora. It's not often you feel compelled to comment on the vegetation in a movie, but the flowers and trees they encounter are simply gorgeous, filling the screen will a whirl of colors completely at odds with the film's tone. The creatures on the other hand are pure nightmare fuel. They're recognizable animals but twisted in horrifying ways that hint at the deeper corruption all around them.Most of the best horror movies work because they stand as a metaphor for our deepest and most common fears. Alien was Rape. The Babadook stood for overwhelming grief. And Annihilation is about guilt, paranoia, and utter mental and emotional breakdown. It's fascinating and more than a little unsettling to watch how each of the main characters slowly become unhinged as they try and fail to come to terms with what they're experiencing. Some display an ever-growing sense of fatalism. Others flat out denial, or overpowering suspicion. In a movie where so much is utterly alien, their breakdowns are surprisingly realistic and nuanced. This could have worked solely as a psychological horror film. But of course the filmmakers weren't content to stop there. There's extremely frightening imagery and bits of gore, used sparingly enough to retain their full impact. The found footage from a previous expedition is literally stomach churning and will probably be too much for many viewers. There are even good jump scares. And oh, how the movie can build suspense. As they go deeper into the Shimmer the tension builds and builds and is held so long as to be almost unbearable. And the ending is simply beyond anything most viewers have ever seen. There are no words to adequately describe it, and to even try would spoil it. Suffice it to say that you will be in a state of utter wonder and bewilderment. There are many things about it I don't understand. But then they're probably not meant to be understood, or even possible to understand. The final act of this movie is Akira level mind-bending. It makes 2001 or Inception look simple and unambiguous. I have my own interpretations of some parts, which I think are what filmmakers intended. But for so many aspects there are no firm answers, only endless possibilities and the questions they create. And that may be the true genius of this movie. For all the terror, the wonder, and the wonderful acting, perhaps what Annihilation succeeds at the most is how much it will make you think.","Annihilation",4435,3.8,-1.2
"4436",4.5,"  it didn't have a superhero in it, that's good enough for me.","Annihilation",4436,3.8,-0.7
"4437",4.5,"  One of the strangest, most perplexing sci-fi films I've seen in a while. Definitely worth a second and third watch to untangle the puzzle of this unapologetically weird little film.","Annihilation",4437,3.8,-0.7
"4438",4,NA,"Annihilation",4438,3.8,-0.2
"4439",3.5,"  THis movie is Definitely worth a watch. However, the acting bothered me throughout. Oscar Isaac acted like he was on drugs in most of his scenes, which I suppose was as intended, but made his performance very boring. Portman was the same character she always plays. Very flat, little emotion, unrelatable. Jennifer Jason Leigh was trying to channel some weird sadistic ""look at me I'm so unhinged and don't care about anything"" performance. Like Isaac's performance, I understand WHY you would go that direction, but with this actress, it just came off as weird and made me disconnected from the film. Overall, I feel like the film could have been cut down by 10-15 minutes, mostly because of the glacial acting, and would have been a lot better for it.Aside from the performances, the visuals were amazing and the story was unique. This will definitely become a cult classic in the future. For me, one viewing was enough, but I'm glad I saw it.?","Annihilation",4439,3.8,0.3

"4446",5,"  As of February 23rd 2018, there are now two movies that genuinely scare me. Pans Labyrinth and Annihilation. The concept of 'the shimmer' presented a terrifying nightmare fueled by science and the unknown and in all honesty, I've never had sweaty palms for so long. The antagonist was refreshingly alien, the lack of intention and confusion presenting a childlike force of rebirth. Though the film could have stood on its two legs with gorgeous visuals alone, every scene was highlighted by an amazing score and sound design. This movie was clearly written for cinema, as I felt utterly encapsulated by noise. Every note demanded my attention. On the surface, its one of my favourite horror movies - and that's what I thought as I walked out of the theatre. But Annihilation isn't a film that you forget about on the drive home. Or as you lay awake in bed trying not to think about screaming bears (How DARE you, Alex Garland). It demands a closer look and as you pick it apart piece by piece, each element shines under examination. Horror film, trippy science fiction, cerebral film about self destruction; there's something for everyone.","Annihilation",4446,3.8,-1.2
"4447",2,"  Good visuals, strange plot that's almost embarrassed to embrace its potential. Only scratched the surface of character development.... But the entire movie is a close up of characters. Frustrating.","Annihilation",4447,3.8,1.8
"4448",1,"  The audience score is alot closer to What this dreary film deserves. The critics are praising what? Characters we dont care to follow ?A Script with meaningless dialog?The whole Geneitic angle that missing forwarding any intersting ideas to ponder Relating to humans tickering. Sonething Garland achieved beautifuly in ex mechina. If this juSt a aCtion film such as predator, it does not engage as a survivAl story.","Annihilation",4448,3.8,2.8
"4449",0.5,"  Ok. I will keep it simple. I LOVE complex, confusing movies. Loved the directors other movie. This movie however, is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I am not sure where or how any decent ratings are coming from. Everyone in the theater also was baffled, confused, laughing at the film (not the funny parts) and disoriented. The film had no purpose, an resolved nothing. It was complete garbage and the ending was so predictable. Again, I repeat. This is by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. I cannot think of another movie that was worse than this. I think people feel they ""have"" to like it, or that it is more complex than it is. To not like it would mean they are stupid. But don't be tricked or lie to yourself. This is the worst movie ever made (on a hollywood/higher budget scale)Terrible and without purpose or resolution..","Annihilation",4449,3.8,3.3

"4455",4,"  It starts off really interesting and makes you feel like a lot is going to haPpen, in more of an action movie sort of way but then really changes gears to a relatable sCience fiction film. I might go see it again tonight.","Annihilation",4455,3.8,-0.2
"4456",3,"  Well... So this is about a supernatural disaster area. It is slowly expanding, and there is very limited knowledge about what exactly is inside of it, given that everyone who has ever entered has failed to return. A biologist (Natalie Portman) volunteers to join a team of ladies as they are the next up to brave the unknown. Now I was actually pretty pumped for this because this is Alex Garland's follow up to the terrific Ex Machina, a movie that I hold dear to my heart. He seems to have a passion for science fiction, so I am going to make a point of following his career moving forward. With Annihilation, there are definitely moments that satiated me throughout, but I was unfortunately left feeling more underwhelmed than I had hoped to be. Now I tried my hardest to get with this. I was able to take the slow pacing, and to be honest, it didn't even bother me all that much, as it felt like it was a deliberate choice made by the director. I like that this cast is almost entirely female, and if there is a movie that passes the Bechdel test, it is this one here. I like all of the science-fiction touches, and Alex Garland isn't exactly a lightweight in that department. He gets some really quality camerawork in with some gorgeous imagery in this surreal dimension. It is really a mystery at heart, and I dug not knowing exactly where it was going, and this is a story that never over-explains, so you are always interested... but as you can probably guess, I am about to drop that other shoe. I have given a lot of thought to this, and I think my biggest problems with this stem around the ending. This puts me in a tough spot as a reviewer, because I never want to be the one to spoil a story for you. What I will do is split the difference and say this: I didn't like the ending to this because I spent so much time investing myself into this story, and for it to wind up being something that is so trite just turned me off. It kind of cheapens all the nice touches that I had previously enjoyed so much, and I feel that there is a pretty good chance that you will walk away from this with a sour taste in your mouth. I also don't think it is as deep as Ex Machina, but hey, this may all just be me. I strongly encourage you to make up your own mind for yourself on this.","Annihilation",4456,3.8,0.8
"4457",5,"  Most interesting original sci-fi horror drama in a long time. left the theater thinking. also all female cast where the actress/characters are treated and writen like real people. I enjoyed it, and it lingered with me long after i watched it.","Annihilation",4457,3.8,-1.2
"4458",0.5,"  I walked out about halfway through. I never really could understand any of it. fair warning ;)","Annihilation",4458,3.8,3.3
"4459",4,"  Suspenseful, intriguing, and a breath of fresh air, Annihilation proves that Alex Garland's Ex-Machina success was not a fluke. Natalie Portman shines as biologist/professor Lena, a character who has nothing to lose and is therefore free from the fear of death that affects the average person. Portman plays Lena with a curious intellect, believable traumatization, and a cold aloofness; there isn't really any reason to like her character, and yet you still find yourself rooting for her to succeed. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays an even quieter and more remote/emotionally hidden psychologist, delivering some of the starkest yet most thought-provoking lines. Tessa Thompson plays a shy physicist, Gina Rodriguez plays a cynical paramedic with some humor, Tuva Novotny plays a geologist, and Oscar Isaac plays Portman's husband, Kane, who is always not saying something. A simple criticism that can be made about Annihilation is its lack of character development. There is a familiar pattern of one by one they all get picked off until there is one left, and no matter how grippingly the movie does that, the overall lack of any investment or development of a character outside Lena cannot be overlooked. We learn a bit about Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, but little about anyone else. The rest of the crew is portrayed as having personal reasons for going on what is essentially a suicide mission, but this is barely explored. The second half of Annihilation quickly becomes the Natalie Portman show when it really doesn't need to be. However, Annihilation is a mind-bending and sometimes challenging film with a little bit of everything for each type of audience member. The visual effects are grandiose, the movie is full of psychedelic imagery that looks like it came from Wonderland; the only criticism I have of the film's visuals is its incessant calls for lens flares, which cheapened too many shots that didn't need them. There are horror elements as well in the film. These are not too scary for those easily frightened, but several scenes are extremely tense and some images will stick with you beyond the theater. The dialogue, while not as interesting or provocative as in Ex-Machina, is still sharply written and thought-provoking. The score does an excellent job at setting the atmosphere within the shimmer; it helps you feel the danger in certain scenes more intensely and the nerve-racking ending in particular is heightened by it. Speaking of the ending, I feel this is where audiences will be divided. The last 20 minutes or so take the film to a whole new level, the craziness and wow factor of the whole thing multiplies. While watching I wanted to know what was going on, but I was too busy screaming in my head ""What is happening!?"" I realized later there wasn't much to analyze and the last shot of the film wasn't hard to see coming either. I believe the whole sequence was meant to represent the movie's central theme of self-destruction, but it could have been more. I'm not disappointed with how Annihilation ended, but I can't say I was fully satisfied either. When a movie has such a great build-up and you become engrossed in the plot, curious to see what the characters discover next about the shimmer and what's inside it, it can become difficult to keep the wheels tightly fastened to the vehicle when racing to the end.Annihilation is a good sci-fi film with some staggering imagery. It captivated me, had me on the edge of my seat, and left me wanting more. But its conclusion, coupled with its shallow supporting characters, kept Annihilation from reaching the level of great sci-fi (cough...cough...Blade Runner 2049).","Annihilation",4459,3.8,-0.2

"4462",4,"  A fun and imaginative movie with some creepy scenes that will make you uncomfortable. The relationship between natalie portman's character and her husband unfolds throughout the movie and provides a unexpected twist. This movie gives you plenty to think about after you leave the theater which Is a good measure if it was worth watching or not. it also has great visuals including some cool and frightening mutated animals and plants. maybe the freshest sci-fi that I've seen in a while. a nice escape.","Annihilation",4462,3.8,-0.2
"4463",3,"  I didn't understand Ex Machina, but some podcasters I like enjoyed the movie ( rather saw merit in the movie) so I thought I'd give it a try. It starts off slow, but is well acted. There's not a lot of action so my attention wandered a bit. It is intriguing that it's an all women team. That was an appeal for me too. But it is a weird movie. It's just very weird. At the end I was like, ""Okay. Enough of this."" I was glad to be done. I must say, though, and it must be emphasized, Natalie Portman is a badass in this movie! I was like, ""Whoa! Was she in the Israeli army or what?"" She doesn't mess around. She really should be doing action pictures. If she want itty-bitty she probably would. But she walks like , ""Hey I'm not playing!"" And she carries herself with such power. Just.... whoa! Yeah Natalie Portman rocked this part.","Annihilation",4463,3.8,0.8

"4467",3.5,"  To describe what the movie 'ANNIHILATION' is in one sentence or more is pretty difficult to do. With that said, if you enjoy watching engaging Sci-fi materials, such as black mirror or twilight zone, I think you'll have good time watching this. The actings are pretty good, visual effects are pretty cool for small Sci-fi movie and good production values overall. The only flaw of the movie will be its high concept and theme that is in the movie, because most people won't understand or want to understand what they have just watched (or experienced) thus leaving the audiences with negative reviews, for lack of better words. At the end of the day, I do hope people will check it out...??","Annihilation",4467,3.8,0.3

"4472",0.5,"  How could so many people be so wrong about a movie? I viewed the trailer and it looked like an exciting, action-packed film involving some cool science fiction. Instead, it was a borefest into a nap. There is no action, there is horrible acting, there is literally no plot other than going into the shimmer, and there is no conclusion to this so-called ""great"" movie. do yourself a favor and save two precious hours of your life and watch anything else.","Annihilation",4472,3.8,3.3

"4480",1,"  (WARNING: INCLUDES SPOILERS) THIS MOVIE WAS FAIRLY BAD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES, WHICH IS VISUALLY IMAGINATIVE (ESPECIALLY THE MIRRORING IDEA). WITH THAT SAID, I OFTEN FOUND MYSELF CRINGING, BORED, STRUGGLING TO BUY INTO THE CHARACTERS BACKSTORIES OR STRUGGLING TO FOLLOW THE WORLD'S / FILM'S LOGIC.WHY WOULD A WOMAN WHO IS AN EXPERT IN CELLULAR BIOLOGY WALK INTO A POTENTIALLY LETHAL ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT A HAZMAT SUIT? WHY SEND A GROUP COMPRISED OF ENTIRELY WOMEN, WHERE BIGGER STRONGER MORE EXPERIENCED MALE SOLDIERS FAILED TO GET OUT SAFELY, UNLESS AT LEAST A FEW OF THE WOMEN HAVE A BACKSTORY THAT INCLUDED SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THEM AS EQUAL OR SUPERIOR SOLDERS OR WOULD MAKE THEM MORE SIGNIFICANTLY LIKELY TO SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT (UNLESS THEY WERE THE ONLY OPTIONS LEFT - WHICH THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THEY WERE)? WHY ARE THE WOMEN WALKING INTO THE SHIMMER? GUNS WORK IN THE SHIMMER, WHICH ARE MECHANICAL, SO WHY NOT A CAR? OR A HELICOPTER? WHY DIDN'T THE TEAM GO INTO THE SHIMMER WHEN THE EDGE WAS MUCH CLOSER TO THE LIGHTHOUSE? WHY IS THE WATER CLEAR IN THE BOTTLE ON THE BASE IN THE SHIMMER IF IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE FOR MONTHS (OR POSSIBLY OVER A YEAR) WHILE A MOSS LIKE SUBSTANCE SEEMS TO BE GROWING ON EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE ELSE? AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WE DISCOVER THINGS ABOUT HER HUSBAND THAT MAKE US QUESTION WHY HE WAS THROWING UP / SICK IN THE BEGINNING? I'M JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE HERE. THERE WERE HOLES EVERYWHERE IN THE PLOT. NEXT, THE ACTORS WERE OFTEN DISCONNECTED FROM EACH OTHER. NATALIE PORTMAN IS A GREAT ACTRESS, THIS IS THE WORST PERFORMANCE I CAN REMEMBER EVER SEEING HER GIVE, AND IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE OF DIRECTING ISSUES. IN ESSENTIAL SCENES SHE'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE OTHER ACTORS. IN MULTIPLE SCENES I THOUGHT, ""IF I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT, THAT'S NOT HOW OR WHERE I (OR THE OTHER PERSON) WOULD STAND, MOVE, OR HOW I WOULD REACT VERBALLY OR NON-VERBALLY.SO MUCH OF THIS MOVIE AND THE SCRIPT FEELS FORCED AND POORLY THOUGHT OUT. IT'S DONE TO BE DONE, NOT BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE FILM. THE MAIN CHARACTERS HAVE TO GO TO THE LIGHTHOUSE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO GO TO MAKE THE MOVIE WORK. THE WOMEN WENT INTO THE SHIMMER WITHOUT HAZMAT SUITS SO THERE WOULD BE MORE CHALLENGES / WAYS FOR THEIR BODIES TO BE PHYSICALLY AFFECTED BY THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE SHIMMER. IT'S ALL WOMEN LEADS BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE WITH AN ALL FEMALE CAST (I DON'T MIND THIS, JUST RATIONALIZE IT - WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THESE PEOPLE AND NO-ONE ELSE? - THEY ALL HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, FEEL GUILTY FOR SOMETHING, OR HAVE A BACKGROUND IN SCIENCE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH). WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY, NATALIE PORTMAN'S REASON FOR GOING INTO THE SHIMMER WASN'T DEVELOPED ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT SHE SHOULD GO IN.I'M SUPER DISAPPOINTED, IF IT WASN'T FOR THE ""BEAR SCENES AND POST BEAR SCENES"" WHICH GOT AN EMOTIONAL REACTION FROM ME BECAUSE THEY WERE JARRING, OR THE CLIMAX SCENES BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT THAN THINGS I'VE SEEN IN OTHER SCIFI ALIEN MOVIES, AND THEY GOT MY IMAGINATION GOING, I WOULD ARGUE THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE THAT I'VE SEEN SINCE NINJA TURTLES, AND THAT'S THE ONLY MOVIE I'VE EVER WALKED OUT OF A THEATER BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS UNWATCHABLE.","Annihilation",4480,3.8,2.8

"4482",1,"  Prefacing this by saying I'm a huge Ex Machina fan, and was excited to see what project came next for Alex Garland. And I can honestly say that it was like watching Tarantino direct ""The Room"" after previously creating the masterwork ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie made me feel insane. I desperately wanted to like it, but the lack of coherence and inane unfulfilled plotlines made it all but unwatchable, no matter how high i was (hint: not enough).

"4485",5,"  Dreamlike. I'll be surprised if there's a better sci-fi movie this year. Much better than the book, Garland took a great idea and made a great film. It owes a lot to Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker which is based on the novel Roadside Picnic. Annihilation swims in visual effects at the expense of character development. Outside of Portman's character the other roles were props. If the film failed at all it was here, where a film like Alien(s) can define a minor character in a single shot and line of dialog, Annihilation seemed to preoccupied with developing the environment as a character to notice, which ends up being its greatest strength and weakness.","Annihilation",4485,3.8,-1.2

"4506",3,"  ""Annihilation' should have been more appropriately retitled ""Synthesis."" Because this movie is not about destruction, as such, but alteration, and combination. Alteration of perceptions of life. Alteration of the environment. Alteration of one's own concept of mind and self.Combination of talents. Combination of perspectives. Combinations of disciplines.My main concerns with the movie was its all-too-standard ""and then there were none"" horror movie structure. Someone gets killed by a beast. Someone mentally snaps. Someone succumbs to their environment. And, of course, the tired ""split up the party even though we know we are dying off one-by-one.""The movie was visually mesmerizing and the plot was compelling. But I felt a lot of the women characters were only given about five minutes of screen time and then shuffled off, mortal coil-wise, to increase the requisite body count.I had wished there would have been more ensemble problem-solving. More to show how women, collectively, would have solved this mystery differently than all-male squads of soldiers.I also felt it was utterly unbelievable how this operation was handled. Why not go in a few feet through the Shimmer, then come right back out?For that matter, why risk human life at all? Why not send in a fleet of drones?As for the climax, I have an overt spoiler alert: the one white phosphorus (WP) grenade resolution of the threat was about as unsatisfying to me as learning that Triffids were allergic to salt water. I can understand that might have stopped the one creature, but why did everything else collapse? The shimmer? The crystals? It all unraveled without explanation.There was, however, redeeming satisfaction in the denouement. Which I hope they leave open-ended and do not ruin with any plans for a sequel.","Annihilation",4506,3.8,0.8

"4508",5,"  **ANALYSIS/SPOILERS**During my first watch, I spent a long while asking Where is this going? Where am I being taken? even as I was transfixed. Each flashback, found video, artifact, and character choice shaded in new details, but the overall shape remained hazy.Until Lena walks into the lighthouse, and my heart lit up in recognition.Between the body and the video, it's evident what's happened in the lighthouse and that the Kane that appeared at Lena's house was not the Kane who came in. For me, that was the key to my entire understanding of the movie.""You ever get out of here, you find Lena,"" Kane tells himself. As soon as I saw that, my thought was, he escaped because a piece of him loved her enough. That empty person who shows up outside the bedroom--all he has left is his love for her. His compass can't point to north, it can only point to her The cascade of understanding that followed was one of the most intense experiences I've ever had, not just while watching a movie but just as a person. The continuing imagery of the film supported and expanded my interpretation. Lena sees exactly how most of Kane died. Then she delves even deeper and is forced to confront the existential horror of Ventress's an-nihil-lation and the organism at the center of the Shimmer, which uses a drop of her blood to imitate first her morphology, then her movement, and finally her face. When Lena hands her copy a grenade and runs, it doesn't move to follow, mirror, or stop her. Lena makes a choice to destroy it and save herself, and that solidified what I'd begun to read into movie, the lens through which I was now reexamining everything that had come before. My perception of meaning spread forward and backward in time from that one moment, unfolding into new spaces with every new look. Annihilation is about therapy itself. The actual, internal process of first learning to see and then to deliberately, constantly destroy maladaptive parts of yourself, accept influences and impulses you cannot change, and make yourself the person you want to be. For all its fixation on inevitability, genetic programming, the impulse towards self-destruction, the faults in God's blueprint for life, Annihilation is about the distinctly human possibility of rising above all of that destruction to intentionally create something.To save her relationship, Lena undertakes an identity-altering journey to confront herself and what she's done, helmed by a psychologist and dragging all of her guilt, grief, self-destruction, determination, and love along with her. Why does the team wake up with no memory of their first days in the Shimmer? Because anyone's first attempts to tease any meaning from the web of subtle and conflicting information we find when we examine ourselves and the infinity of influences on that Self is futile. Upon beginning the process of therapy, you're mostly just noticing how unmindful you've been, floating forward in time, steered by impulse. You have to learn how to learn, how to determine what is a reliable and useful observation, and when it feels like nothing is, how to move forward anyway.The team examines the evidence--how much they've eaten, which direction is south. Similarly, in therapy, you latch on to something promising, or just the most solid thing you can find, and you explore that. From here on out, everything looks new, impossible, inscrutable. As you learn to acknowledge the internal, environmental, and interpersonal ways you build your Self and how they compound and refract each other, you're forced to acknowledge that you simply are all of your decisions and reactions. Those pieces come from somewhere and go somewhere, and you can study the ways you find yourself feeling controlled or in control, the ways you're affected by everything around you and affect everything in return. You can learn that while the entire process is indeed inscrutable, your patterns within it are not. Those connections are at times both beautiful and terrifying because understanding yourself--enlightenment, if you will--requires complete acceptance of yourself as a collection of experiences and actions, and some of those are very, very bad.The composition of the team of scientists works on so many levels. As far as we know, they're the first scientists to enter the Shimmer; the previous teams were soldiers. This illustrates the ways that trying to force yourself to change without serious self-examination is futile; there is no brute-force solution to fixing something broken within yourself. Everyone becomes a scientist once they begin to examine themselves, to gather evidence and conduct experiments and analyze relationships between variables. Perhaps the best equipped is both scientist and soldier, someone who can face and win the necessary fights along the path to healing; as Ventress tells Lena: ""A soldier scientist. You can fight. You can learn. You can save him.""There's also the explicit textual version of the team: a group of women with little to lose, lots of baggage, and bad coping skills. I've read a lot of opinions that the dialogue on the boat felt unrealistic; I'll agree that this scene gives so much away with so little subtlety that it's not just poor dialogue, it feels out of place in an otherwise uncompromising film. It felt like a studio note: ""put something in there that explains the whole theme of self-destruction!"" However, since we're given it so explicitly, might as well note how neatly these women seem to each have one particular challenge they're facing: Ventress's mortality and lack of connection, Sheppard's grief, Thorensen's addiction and the suggested anger issues fueling it, and Radek's numbness and inability to be vulnerable/honest. Lena is consumed by guilt; it's revealed clearly enough that she knows Kane was aware of her affair and that it was that betrayal that pushed him to volunteer for a mission into the Shimmer in the first place.A little more abstracted: The team is literally led by a psychologist whose singular goal is to reach the source of the problem (notably, Lena's problem, since it holds the answer to saving Kane). Those who accompany Lena help and hold back that quest at varying times; however, at their cores, Radek, Thorensen, Sheppard, and Ventress aren't there to examine themselves. They're too caught up in their self-destructive cycles to get past what's holding them back. Whether it's recklessness, anger, or fear, psychopathy is in control. This applies to Dr. Ventress as well. While in-character Ventress is swept along at the whim of her impulses, her explicit distinction between decisions and impulses at the watchtower illustrates the central conflict of the movie. Yes, she reaches the lighthouse, but she's drawn there impulsively, desperately. Rather than decide how to react, as Kane and Lena do, she is destroyed by her own nihilism. Expectations and your belief that you have some control play a huge role in the success or failure of therapy; if you don't go in believing you will gain something and willing to learn, you're not going to do either. If you are too afraid of change and the ways it is inherently the death of something, you cannot change for the better.So we watch the team break down and the individuals within it break down, in a variety of figurative and literal ways. For me there were simultaneous journeys at each of the previously described levels of abstraction. We have five individuals faced with utter confusion and terror, and we see the ways each person can or can't face, deal with, and move on from the challenges. This reflects the ways real people you interact with while undergoing a therapeutic process can help or hinder your efforts, particularly people who are also suffering from mental illness. The hyper-reactive environment illustrates the various coping methods and the ways the characters and environment begin to absorb and regurgitate each other. Even more abstracted: Each of the struggles faced by the team is also affecting Lena, specifically in relation to her affair. Guilt is dominant, and there's the glimmer of hope she has now that some part of Kane has returned. But this is therapy, so we have to work backwards. The affair doesn't take place in a vacuum. We see a little of Lena and Kane's relationship in happy flashbacks, but we learn a lot more about it from Dan. Kane's inability to share his inner life with Lena or connect with her intellectually is mirrored in Radek's numbness; Lena turning to someone else for that connection is just another version of self-harm to satisfy a desperate craving for feeling. We know the affair wasn't a one-time thing, it was an addiction for Lena, stimulation she used to fill the emptiness Kane was unable or unwilling to alleviate despite its corrosion of not only the marriage but ultimately all of Lena's relationships, including her concept of herself. And of course, at the beginning of the movie, Lena is grieving the death of her husband in the wake of the death of trust in her marriage. She can't even grieve as a wife without inflaming her guilt for pushing Kane away, seemingly to his death, without ever being able to admit, apologize, atone, or explain. Like Ventress, she's just stuck expecting but never quite achieving the certainty of those deaths, unable to share her pain; similarly, she jumps at the chance to use the fact that she has nothing left to lose to at least try to find answers that might allow something she cares about to outlive her. The affair is so central to Lena's motivations on so many levels that I have trouble understanding some of the reactions I've read that say the character motivations felt muddled or that they can't understand why anyone would go into the Shimmer. We have one obvious perspective character, and she has one obvious goal: saving her husband's life because she both loves him and feels responsible for his near-death and the pain that preceded it. At the beginning of the movie when she asks if she's allowed to go home, Ventress says ""Is that what you want?"" and Lena says ""I want to be with him."" There are a million beautiful details, but that is the only point. And the only way to do that is to enter the Shimmer and learn everything she can about what happened to him. He asked her to save him, to save them, and she rose to the challenge. It just turns out that inside the Shimmer, she's forced to face what she did to him, not just from her perspective, but from his. She learns how certain his death was when he chose to go in, the disintegration of self that he watched his teammates succumb to. The house in the abandoned settlement in the Shimmer is a copy of Kane and Lena's house. It's no accident that Lena is faced with the bear-monster inside that house, the nightmarish union of a loved one stolen by and then entangled with an unpredictable predator. For Kane, during the affair, he was trapped in that house, tied to a marriage, hearing screams and moans he never wanted to imagine, trying not to give away that he even knows the problem's there. Just as Thorensen blames Lena for Sheppard's death through her inaction and her dishonesty for destabilizing the group's efforts going foward, Kane feels responsible for pushing Lena away, to someone else, irreversibly damaging their relationship and taking with it the trust on which any future might be built. Thorensen explodes when she finds her trust betrayed but instead of attacking only Lena directly, she ties everyone up and traps them in the house--as Lena's choice did to both her and Kane. Thorensen screams the words Kane wanted to say to Lena, who is forced to look those accusations in the face. Then, literal ghost of their earlier actions haunts them in that house, stalking the walls they've put up to hide their feelings from each other (targeting Radek) that feeds it before finally being neutralized by Lena ending the affair (Thorensen's death) and Kane's decision to volunteer for the mission (mirroring Radek's self-harm, need to do/feel something coping mechanism--she kills the bear) that solves nothing except the most immediate, superficial problem (the bear/affair). Ventress, with her inability to form romantic or familial or even friendly connections, leaves immediately, just as any possibility of Lena and Kane communicating did.I think it's crucial that it's after this moment, and after Ventress has left the group, that Josie chooses to radically change herself. Not only has Josie, as a character, been examining herself as she trekked through the shimmer and seen the possibilities it presents, but Lena can finally empathize with Kane's pain (after the bear scene) and thus connect with him. It's time for Josie, as a character, as a symbol, as an aspect of Lena, to find resolution. Josie uses her sudden self-knowledge to find the new way ""to feel alive"" that Sheppard said she was searching for, becoming a haunting, beautiful monument to the peace that is possible through acceptance and vulnerability. This is the same decision Kane makes. ""Imagine dying frightened and in pain and having that as the only part of you that survives."" Kane chooses, like Josie, to make sure that part of him is not the part that lives.By entering the Shimmer, Kane underwent his own therapeutic process, and lost so much of himself along the way. However, he also learned what he needed to do and found the strength to do it. We see Kane's character arc out of order, so it's a little hard to piece together, but it starts with the man who left on a suicide mission rather than call out his wife for cheating and actually talk about his problems. The depiction of Kane in the video found at the the abandoned base is brutally practical. He is able to make decisions and act under the direst of circumstances in the service of his goals, which are actually pretty selfless. This shows that Kane is rising to the challenge of the shimmer. If he had been able to slice open his marriage to show the corruption underneath the skin rather than ditching Lena without ever addressing the affair, well, there wouldn't be a movie. It was this strength and singularity of purpose that allowed part of him to escape the Shimmer and demand commensurate action from Lena. He finds the resilience to reflect deeply, the humility to accept his part in things, and finally the ability to choke out the words ""I don't think I'm well"" to the one person he needs to tell. For me, the idea of whether he is ""the same person"" is irrelevant and unknowable. Indeed, we don't know which Kane is the ""alien"" and which is the Kane that walked into the Shimmer, or whether that question is even relevant based on how much of the original Kane was in each body. When we find new strength or new darkness in ourselves, are we the same person? How much change would it take to make us a new person? Isn't that the essence of being a person, to be in a state of constant change and not notice until it happens abruptly and painfully? All these questions, then, arise in the moments between Lena finding Kane's body/the camera in the lighthouse and meeting the alien. I immediately interpreted this as the death of Kane's cowardice and weakness and lack of clarity, and the survival of the Kane who, above all else, wanted to find his wife. I think Lena did, too: she watched all of his depersonalization, his questioning, his avoidance, just disintegrate into certainty. She knows as well as us where the Kane who lives goes: home, to her. In the darkness under the lighthouse, Lena catches up with an eyeless, presumably sightless, Ventress. As an individual, she's unable to process her fear of death. She's so consumed by the knowledge of death encroaching throughout her body that she can't see anything beyond that ending. She can only interpret what she finds there in terms of her end. Is that why the alien doesn't approach her to create a copy? In the framing of this meeting, we see light and dark paths behind Lena; only darkness and dead ends surround Ventress. She hasn't reached any deeper understanding of herself or created the new, stronger person she needs to become to find acceptance in the face of her imminent death. Instead, she dies terrified, projecting her own feelings onto the forces of change. As a symbol, we see her literally annihilated, by the definition I included at the beginning of this piece: She becomes light. She never sees that light, but Lena does. The enlightened Lena faces the alien presence that morphs to look and act more and more like her. We've caught up to the moment I described earlier, and the crux of the movie. We see alien watch Lena, mirror her, hold her, to her disgust and horror. What is it learning from her? At first has no gendered features, but a prominent belly button (its human essence, the idea that it was born, is exaggerated through this and the birth imagery of the cave), while not having enough information yet for social construction or exchange. This made me wonder how much time Kane spent with his double, a much more developed copy. It has learned the details of his appearance, his language, even a bit of his heart. We know Lena spent four months in the Shimmer and Kane spent maybe twelve; presumably, a lot of that was here, at the lighthouse, getting to the point where his dying words to his alien self feel like a benediction to a friend.The one thing the alien mimics instead of mirroring is Lena's attempt to run away. The alien runs the same direction and ends up holding her back from that goal, nearly suffocating her against the wall of the lighthouse. It's a literalization of the futility of running away from your problems, from your darkest impulses, and most crucially for Lena the consequences of her actions, instead of facing them. It also shows that what the new Lena is learning is the worst of her, the things she needs to overcome. When describing the alien to Lomax she says she doesn't think it wants anything; I think it's more accurate to say that its wants, its impulses are learned, just as all of ours are. They are only a mystery because we didn't pay attention to being taught. Lena has now learned how to do that, thanks to the Shimmer, and she knows what to do if given a second chance. Lena chooses to destroy the new thing and leave, and the Shimmer's distortion and exaggeration is destroyed with it. We don't know, and even she doesn't know, if she made the correct choice or if Kane did, in starting over. She has shut the door on what that person could have become. The Kane that kills himself is a shell full of the things the wanted to leave behind, because you can't leave the Shimmer without owning your choices and acting with purpose. You get out by adapting to the chaos and learning to constantly locate your evolving self within it. It's meaningful that, instead of sitting with Kane's body, Lena's alien crawls back into its lonely hole to die, disconnected and alone, surrendered to destruction like Ventress. Lena saved the part of herself that loves Kane.Obviously, the person being questioned is different from the Lena who went into the Shimmer. We'll never know all the ways that's true; even Lena probably won't. None of us can fully comprehend or control the ways we change over time, we can only control our choices and accept responsibility for the person we are even as we attempt to study all the uncontrollable factors that influence us. Understanding is not a moment; it's an unending process. It's work with surprising, unpredictable moments of reward. What we do know is that the Lena who got out wants nothing more than to embrace the husband she's saved, and that husband, whatever new person he has made, hugs her back. Their reconciliation is the moment both of them get what they singularly wanted and worked for and died for and rebuilt themselves for. And you don't get to that moment of peace, that new beginning full of renewed trust, without every bit of that work. Our sentience is the key to turning off the thoughtless, impulsive destruction we're pulled towards over time: it allows us to see ourself in where we have been, what we've done, and what can be created. Therapy, or any self-reflection, is itself a continuous mutation.Annihilation is a love story about two shattered, disintegrating people who actually love each other enough to go through the pain and work of changing, of building a more complete, more resilient, and more loving self. As someone who has been the Kane at the top of the stairs, asking someone else to acknowledge their part in my destruction only to have them do nothing, as someone who's been into the Shimmer to save myself, to make something new, many times, that's transcendently beautiful to me.","Annihilation",4508,3.8,-1.2
"4509",2,"  Annihilation is a dark movie with long periods of foreboding combined with brief and intense action scenes. Lots of flashbacks, many of which seemed pointless (like the ones with Natalie Portman's character and her colleague). There was also that odd and for me unsatisfying ending. I could never identify with the characters; all of whom were under the influence of... (opioids?). Perhaps the screen writers suffered from same. A lot of money was obviously spent making this movie (great cast, great FX), but it was ultimately a muddled and boring mishmash.","Annihilation",4509,3.8,1.8

"4511",2,"  Just surreal in the visual aspects and subject matter, on the whole a bore that does not end correctly. Everyone around me got the same feeling walking out, like they had been duped.","Annihilation",4511,3.8,1.8
"4512",4,"  I definitely glad I saw it in the theater. Trippy movie for sure. A very unique movie and Visually striking.","Annihilation",4512,3.8,-0.2
"4513",0.5,"  This was a mind-numbingly awful film with only one redeeming quality....the credits. It is unclear what film other critics watched in order to give this tedious collection of disjointed scenes the rating they gave it, but perhaps they too spent too much time in the 'Shimmer'. Spoiler Alert: That is what they called the slowly spreading anomaly resulting from the meteor strike that opens the film. The only thing moving slower than the anomaly was the acting and the actual film itself. The statement ""exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll"" can only mean we will eventually realize the fact that we enjoyed the popcorn more than the film.","Annihilation",4513,3.8,3.3
"4514",5,"  Amazing film, very poetic","Annihilation",4514,3.8,-1.2
"4515",3,"  The intriguing trailer with ""The Alien"" melody sold me on watching Annihilation in theaters instead of waiting for it to appear on Netflix. The synthesized notes promised an eerie, captivating, and horrific journey into Alex Garland's adaptation of the first book of the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy. And horrific is right. Horrifically disappointing.The film follows Lena (Natalie Portman) and fellow scientist/volunteers into a mysterious ""Shimmer"" that changes the land it encroaches upon. All of the previous military volunteers that have entered are never heard from again, except for Lena's husband (Oscar Issac). In order to save her husband from mysterious health problems, Lena joins a group of scientists to study the ""Shimmer"" and reach its core at the lighthouse. Interestingly enough, the group is all female, which reflects our current climate of the all female dream team (Ghostbusters, Ocean's). The film has a great cast with amazing performances, blah blah blah. Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the negatives.In the ""Shimmer,"" the group makes groundbreaking discoveries, while attempting to survive. But the film digs its own grave when it comes to caring about the characters and building suspense due to its opening, which shows Lena post journey out of the ""Shimmer"" being interviewed by scientists. She mentions who dies, who goes missing, and the very fact that she's there in a lab room confirms that she survives as well. So scenes later where danger is imminent, we already have a good idea as to what will happen. Talk about fun.When we compare Annihilation with Alex Garland's previous sci-fi film, Ex Machina, the flaws become obvious. Unlike Ex Machina, Annihilation is not focused. It's an adventure, drama, fantasy, horror, mystery, and thriller. There's the aches of love, the influence of psychology, the beauty of evolution, the creation of monsters, the existence of aliens, and the crisis of existence. The film spreads itself too thin, with more ambitious topics than there are baddies in Spider-Man 3. I would rather watch a story that delves into one or two of these ideas, than try to tackle many parts of a different whole.Like Arrival (which is a much better alien mystery), Annihilation relies on several twists of its own. But compared to the weight that they're given, the twists don't hold enough impact or surprise. You could even say that the final twist is a failed attempt at an Inception like ending. With Inception, viewers are so engrossed with the dream world and its implications that the twist of whether Leo's character is still in a dream or not comes naturally. In Annihilation, a question is asked in the end which falls flat on itself like a teenager trying to sound deeper than s/he actually is. The question shouldn't have been asked. It easily takes away the buildup of the final scene and makes the whole ending laughable.David Ellison, financier at Paramount, was concerned that the film was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"" and wanted changes to be made to appeal to a broader audience (in order words, dumb it down). I couldn't disagree more, not for the same reasons as the director, but because there's nothing complicated about the film. Intellectual? Sure, it deals with science. But the actual science within the ""Shimmer"" is completely fictional and relies on the entertainment value to make any of it believable. Complicated? Now that's just an insult to moviegoers. Although don't be surprised if you run across several people who bought into the film as thought-provoking. On the surface, it's shrouded with stupendous fantasy. But at its very core, like the one in the ""Shimmer,"" it is as purposeless as the alien that lives there.Chad: 3/5 (Still, the movie is really pretty (e.g., effects, Shimmer, Natalie Portman) and the soundtrack is chilling.)","Annihilation",4515,3.8,0.8
"4516",1.5,"  The idea of this movie is great, but it was very slow and boring. I would suggest you wait until it comes out on iTunes and not waste you time or money seeing it in the theaters.","Annihilation",4516,3.8,2.3
"4517",2,"  The beginning of the film was superb, cerebral....then it got dumb, boring.","Annihilation",4517,3.8,1.8
"4518",5,"  I'm probably gonna be talking about this movie all year. There are personal criticism and objective. Objectively speaking no one can deny this is a brilliant film. It has phenomenal production design, excellent and emotional cinematography, a brilliant and thought-provoking story, and brilliant performances and execution all around. ""Annihilation"" is a triumph of cinema. A true ""modern-day classic"" of a film if there ever was one. A film that falls into the category of films that embrace Big Ideas in ways that presuppose viewers are intelligent and attentive. Is that asking too much from the average movie-goer? Full of fresh perspectives and a powerful message ""Annihilation"" makes you think. It makes you wonder about the mysteries of genetics and the fragility of DNA. It makes you think about what happens when parts of the body no longer feel familiar and how quickly those changes can arise. It asks about the human capacity for self-destruction and it explores the power of guilt.Garland deserves all the praise he is getting. And should apologize to no one. The studio should be ashamed for limiting this film.","Annihilation",4518,3.8,-1.2
"4519",5,"  Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina. Being one of my favorite films of that year, I found myself extremely excited for his next directed project. Annihilation has just hit theatres and if you're not someone who enjoys a slow burn in order to reach a worthy payoff, then this movie may not be for you. If you're up for anything and can embrace any sort of sci-fi story, then here's why I think you'll probably end up loving this movie as much as I did.Going into detail about the plot of this film would truthfully ruin it, so I'm going to explain this premise as simple as I possibly can. After having to deal with a tragic personal incident, Lena tasks herself with a group of women who plan to enter a forcefield area that has been created after a meteor has hit. Learning that they may not all come out alive, they strive forward to find the answers. Yes, that sounds very vague, but it's hard to talk about this movie to someone who hasn't seen it. For a premise like this, you need a few key things to make it work; A great screenplay, a great cast, and a nice through-line of direction to hold the movie together.Annihilation is a film that places its characters first before anything else, and while that definitely works in its favor, if the story surrounding them doesn't work then the overall film will fall pretty flat. Although it takes itself very seriously and many of the scenes are very slow-paced, you can tell that Garland has created a film that will slowly reveal itself as it goes along, providing insight into the backstory of each character as well as providing answers as who what exactly they're trying to uncover. Flashing back and forth between the past and the future, answers are given at the most opportune times in order to benefit the film.Natalie Portman remains a powerhouse when it comes to dramatic performances. I've always been a fan of her in pretty much any dramatic role and this one was no exception. That being said, she's not the only one who shines here. From Gina Rodriguez to Tessa Thompson, each of the supporting members seemed to have their time to shine and certain inciting moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some truly thrilling moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I know I'm a sucker for great sci-fi films, but this is just another one to add to the list.In the end, while I can't say everyone will love this movie because I'd be lying if I did, I believe that everyone can at least admire the attempt at being different and unique from most mainstream movies out there today. Annihilation takes risks and doesn't give itself up to a generic conclusion. It chooses to be different from most films and never lets its foot off that peddle. Wonderfully directed, very well-written, and beautiful to look at, I can't really come up with any huge complaints. Yes, some will complain about the pacing and few may even complain about it being too bizarre in its final act, but I found these aspects to be a great addition. Annihilation is a fantastic movie and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up in my discussion for best films of 2018 at the end of the year. The year is still very young, but I can't recommend this movie enough. Go in with an open mind and you may just love it.","Annihilation",4519,3.8,-1.2
"4520",2,"  Bad science fiction. Terrible adaptation of a trilogy that made more sense. The oft repeated line I don't now in the movie echoes the writers skill.","Annihilation",4520,3.8,1.8
"4521",0.5,"  Might have been the worst movie I've ever seen.The characters had potential but the story completely fell apart. I love Sci-Fi but this movie was a turd. I almost walked out but I forced myself to sit to the end in hopes that there would be a twist or something that would make it worthwhile, but there isn't. The only reason to go is for Natalie Portman.","Annihilation",4521,3.8,3.3
"4522",5,"  Starting off my stating ""The Thing"" is my all time favorite movie. This film with its tone, characters, look, ambiance, sounds and premise is now in my top ten. Definitely in love with Garland's work since ""Ex Machina"".","Annihilation",4522,3.8,-1.2

"4526",4.5,"  I thought this was a really good movie! It was beautiful, trippy, tense, exciting, and leaves you with questions that crave answers. It felt like art and yeah.

"4530",2.5,"  I just seen it tonight and from what I seen and looked the ongoing reaction from the people inside the screen room. I was not to good and I have to admit I love movies like this. But all I can say is its ok to watch at home. Save your money and wait until it's available on DVD.","Annihilation",4530,3.8,1.3
"4531",1,"  Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.","Annihilation",4531,3.8,2.8
"4532",2,"  I really liked Director Alex Garland's first movie Ex Machina - it's slow paced worked for it and paid off in the end. Annihilation started off similarly, but couldn't get out of its own way.At a certain point - I just gave up on the characters. There was nothing there that tied them together, nothing that made them compelling for me or made me care for them or their plight. The attempts to to try to add a bit to Portman's character just fell flat for me. It's a shame, because there are some great actors there that just didn't have the characterization or script to make it work for them.I like science fiction and this could have been great science fiction firmly rooted in a little bit science fact (with the needed wiggle room). Instead we get a slow build with no real payoff and more questions and answers. In the end those questions that we are left with are just questions that I really didn't care about.The effects are well done and the movie looks great. But, that couldn't save what just became a mess to me. I hope Garland can rebound with his next movie.","Annihilation",4532,3.8,1.8

"4535",5,"  Amazing movie. Every part of this movie was unpredictable","Annihilation",4535,3.8,-1.2
"4536",1,"  The acting was so bad. There was no plot. Could have been a great story line for a second but failed big time.","Annihilation",4536,3.8,2.8
"4537",4,"  It's marvelous how fascinating it can be to see humanity reflect upon itself and its purpose when cornered on the brink of annihilation. However, this thought does not accurately summarize this film: humankind is not necessarily facing obliteration here nor are these reflections portrayed as natural and external but rather as forced and internal. This movie's a bit difficult to describe.....It can be safely assured, though, that the film is a surreal, dream-like experience with fantastic visuals and legitimately challenging questions. The term ""annihilation"" is explored in a few different, yet enthralling ways, the predominant of which being from a cellular perspective. The nature of the human structure in its simplest form is a composition of cells as are the structures of every living thing; though the cellular characteristics are unique between organisms, the cellular structures tie all of them together. Considering this eerie biological similarity between all Earthly life, the film then dares the audience to question the distinction humans have from any other life form. What relevance does humanity have to a greater purpose when, structurally, it blends in with everything else? The film's title is further studied in the idea that the true annihilation of the human race would not come from some external force or invasion but rather by internal means. Specifically, the focus here is on self-destruction, exemplified by Natalie Portman's character in the form of grief and in other ways by all of the women on the expedition. The film approaches its questions both literally and psychologically, effectively driving you deeper into ""the shimmer"" with the characters as the plot progresses. It's a very intriguing and challenging sci-fi thriller that recalls movies like Under the Skin and Ex-Machina (this director's previous film). It's gorgeous, strange, fascinating, eerie, mind-boggling, creative, immersive, clever, and I really enjoyed it.","Annihilation",4537,3.8,-0.2
"4538",0.5,"  As big long time sifi fan, IMHO this flick is awful, simply awful. No character development. I could not have cared less about the fate of these opaque characters. Story line riddled with numerous holes, absurdities and inconsistencies. The moldy sponge ball alien was laughable. A boring pointless sex scene that the director was so proud of that he used it not once but twice during the movie. But the worst aspect is the complete lack of casual relationships....stuff just randomly happens in this film. I'd prefer to have watched Plan Nine from Outer Space or Monster Robot. At least those are cult flicks that make no pretense at aiming for adequacy.","Annihilation",4538,3.8,3.3
"4539",0.5,"  This movie is terrible on so many different levels it's hard to describe. Story is total nonsense. Acting is horrible. Background music makes you want to tear your hair out.","Annihilation",4539,3.8,3.3
"4540",1,"  This film was so uncomfortably quiet to see in a theater, I don't believe anyone actually enjoyed their popcorn! Storyline was so slow and so predictable I should have walked out.","Annihilation",4540,3.8,2.8
"4541",5,"  I read Jeff V.'s novel, really liked it and felt this was excellent--although not 100% faithful--adaptation (and that's OK--there were elements the movie did better, in my opinion). The screenplay took some liberties to create more visual tension and excitement without losing the fundamental question of ""what does it mean to be human"" and ""what is the meaning of life""? I think this belongs up there with other ""big question"" movies such as Blade Runner. The pacing reminded me of ""Arrival""--thoughtful nuance and backstory interspersed with action and unveiling. I disagree with other critics that the characters were wooden and needed more development. They are developed just enough for us to care for them and to show their humanity and their imperfection--but their complicated back-stories don't bog down the fantastic discovery in the movie. This is great entertainment, excellent acting, and fantastic imaginative visuals--saw it twice and enjoyed it immensely both times.","Annihilation",4541,3.8,-1.2
"4542",1,"  Worst movie I've seen in some time. Plot terrible, irrelevant special effects. And the bad guy is ""the shimmer"". Who could possibly like this movie???","Annihilation",4542,3.8,2.8
"4543",1,"  Annihilation was terrible. Total disjointed crap. First, after other expeditions went in and did not return they decide to send in another, totally inapt and unprepared squad to see what was going on. The director must have been a totally mutton head.","Annihilation",4543,3.8,2.8
"4544",1.5,"  If you loved the premise of Lost then suffered the irritating ""conclusion"" that left much unresolved, Annihilation is cut from similar cloth. Great concept that appears to be too complicated for the writer to get himself out of. Character motivations for early decisions are undercut by later reveals in what drove them. Characters you want to like, but cannot ultimately care about. And, while I know its getting raves for those graphics and effects...looked more like the were out of the 70s version of Planet of the Apes. Save your money and the 2 hours.","Annihilation",4544,3.8,2.3
"4545",1,"  Dam I was so bored ....Crappy slow story .....","Annihilation",4545,3.8,2.8
"4546",3,"  C+, average at best but wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better then the horrible ""ARIVAL"" and CONTACT put into 1! 75% fresh if you must! Very SLOW!!!! was that just to make it 2 hours? they EASILY could have made it into 1h 40 minnutes! I think it would have been better to watch it at home, I Honestly enjoyed the CLOVERFEILD PARADOX more!!!!!!!!!!","Annihilation",4546,3.8,0.8
"4547",4.5,"  Annihilation could have easily been a bad movie, I mean you have a trailer that doesn't show you much and isn't widely seen on television. A film company that apparently doesn't think the film needs any advertising dollars, and isn't released to many theaters nationwide or even worldwide whatsoever.All of these things tell you this film is going to bomb, but you go to see it anyway because you like Natalie Portman, and what you do see in the trailer does pique your interest a bit.And by the end of the film you are not only pleasantly surprised, but left wanting more, much more. And that is how I felt when I left the theater tonight.First let me get this out of the way, the film is incredible. It's easy to describe, but the complexity of what is portrayed should leave you wanting more. It is intellectual, but that is not a bad word, or it should not be at least. I don't think you need an MD proceeding your name to understand the technical aspects of what the film is there to teach us, about biology, psychology, and humanity as a whole.At times the film does become technical, however ignorance of the content at large should not make you dislike the film, only rather want to understand it a little more. But for those who despise science, or intellectual content in general, you kind of get a monster movie, somewhat and also it has some action, intermingled with dialogue and some very intense, truly terrifying moments.It is truly the reason why science fiction exists, and why we like it as readers, and movie goers in general. It tingles the senses in all the right ways, and stimulates the brain when it needs that stimulation, but most importantly it never over reaches beyond its plot, its story, the meat of things. And the story is very simple: There is area, called the shimmer. It grows larger with each passing day, and anyone who enters it, doesn't come back. And that by itself is the start to a great science fiction plot. And it would be easy to lose itself in a basic, sci-fi movie of the week way by throwing monsters at us, bludgeoning its cast into an ever growing body count, and tossing a little sex in there at times to keep things interesting. And for your sci-fi movie of the week that would be your average trashy B movie. However, here it has some of these things, and still manages to give us an intelligent, well crafted, well acted, intriguing story that challenges the sci-fi movie story paradigm we are all used to seeing on screen.My only gripe is the title, which once you have seen the film, and understand what annihilation technically means, seems as somewhat of a misnomer of sorts. It may be intentional, I did not read the book, though I just purchased the trilogy on Amazon to read very soon, but I'm unsure as to why its named as such right now.Getting beyond that, I praise this film highly, and intend to purchase it as soon as it is available to watch on blu-ray merely to listen to the commentary while watching it again.If you like science fiction, you should love this film.","Annihilation",4547,3.8,-0.7

"4549",4,"  A mindfuck of a movie that left me wanting more. Frankly, I think I need to see this again to see if I can gain additional insight from subtleties I may have missed. Additionally, was delighted by some of the soundtrack choices, especially the song by Moderat (among my favorite recording artists), 'The Mark (Interlude)', used near the end during the trippiest part of the film; an inspired choice for sure. Worth a look if you like thoughtful and somewhat impressionistic films that finish ambiguously.","Annihilation",4549,3.8,-0.2

I won't even give it a 1/2 star, except I had to to make this warning post to unsuspecting movie goers.

"4560",3.5,"  3.5 Star Review:Annihilation is wonderfully crafted cerebral film that transports audiences into a world that is as terrifying as it is beautiful and mesmerizing. Natalie Portman stars as Lena, whom embarks on a perilous mission with 4 other women as they venture into the ""Shimmer"" that is emanating from a lighthouse that was struck by a meteor 3 years prior. Previous missions to go in and learn about the Shimmer have resulted in failure as all who go in never come out; that is until Lena's husband does so, but not without consequences. The director of this film, Alex Garland, elegantly weaves multiple story lines together while also making a thought-provoking commentary on the nature of life, death and the formation of life itself. In my opinion, however, all the build-up turns into a dissatisfying final 20 minutes where Garland simply ended up juggling too much at once and ended up hurting the film's end. In understanding the film's end, I came to realize the final act of the movie was in fact anti-climatic even though it seemed anything but as I was watching the movie real-time. For the longest time, I thought I was watching the best film in this young 2018 but in the end, I have to give it the same score as the last film I reviewed.","Annihilation",4560,3.8,0.3
"4561",5,"  The film Annihilation destroyed and bent traditional movie genres with both its visual style and thematic elements. It was at times horrifyingly violent, touchingly sensual and sexual, dramatic and funny. Its themes ranged from cosmic theories of how the universe will end, Annihilation, to how life begins and changes. It was wonderful to see female protagonists fight their own external and internal demons, at times personified. Bertrand Russell, a pioneer in anti-war and anti-imperialistic thought in our modern time said, ""fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom."" Facing the extinction of all we know from a colonizing alien species, is it possible to face the fear of change, and become something else? Through allegory and metaphor, Annihilation seeks to ask us this question.","Annihilation",4561,3.8,-1.2
"4562",4.5,"  Wow. This movie is amazing! From the visuals to the story, Annihilation is an incredibly unique film. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that some parts seemed rushed, most likely because the filmmakers had to cut portions of the film due to run time. The pacing can also be a bit slow at times. But, other than that this film is definitely worth a watch, and will leave you thinking about it after leaving the theater. This is a near-perfect sci-fi flick!","Annihilation",4562,3.8,-0.7
"4563",4,"  Is this movie worth seeing? That is always the main question. The answer is most definitely yes. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit more than the likes of 'Arrival"" and other recent sci-fi movies. The world within the shimmer is beautiful and mind bending, and one of my few complaints is that I wish we saw more of it. The few glimpses we get of the creatures and ecosystems within are mesmerizing and I was always wanting to see more. Maybe in a possible sequel? My other complaint is that this movie starting slow and the script was awkward and quite awful at times. The lines and acting seemed very forced and faked at the beginning, but I'd say it definitely got better as the movie went on. Dr. Ventress(Jennifer Jason Leigh) was one of my most hated characters Ive watched in a movie in many years. Her character seemed totally fake and the acting was extremely forced. Maybe she was just doing the best she could with the terrible starting script. Aside from a few flaws like those, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. The ending was superb and left you walking away with a great sense of wonder as to what really happened (not in the sense of confusion, I didnt find the plot hard to follow like a lot of people did. But just how its open to examination as to what exactly happened and what will happen). The sound effects and score were very well executed and gave me an amazing and intriguing feeling similar to witnessing/hearing ""Interstellar"" for the first time. If you're looking for a beautiful, mind bending sci-fi movie, I highly recommend this movie to you","Annihilation",4563,3.8,-0.2
"4564",5,"  Intelligent science fiction that fills the viewer with a sense of wonder!","Annihilation",4564,3.8,-1.2

"4567",0.5,"  This movie doesn't explain the situation in movie well and goes back to past and present.","Annihilation",4567,3.8,3.3
"4568",4,"  This movie is odd. Very odd. But it's also kind of great. Natalie Portman is of course amazing as always, and the visuals in the film are quite stunning. While it's classified as a fantasy adventure flick, it also has tones of horror - with quite striking switches from a colorful world, to a dark, gritty one lurking beneath the surface. The last half an hour becomes weird af and will leave you asking lots of questions and pondering what you just witnessed, but it's well worth the watch. It's a film that I'm really glad I saw on the big screen, because I don't think a television will fully capture its essence.","Annihilation",4568,3.8,-0.2
"4569",4.5,"  In today's age of Hollywood blockbuster films and movies that recycle overused formulas, it is rare to find films that do something new and creative. In particular, it is hard to find good science fiction films anymore, as many of the ones that do come out (Valerian, Jupiter Ascending, Transformers) are glorified, big-budget action films with lots of special effects. However, every once in a while, directors will craft something special. This has resulted in a handful of memorable sci-fi films made in the past decade. Films like Interstellar, Gravity, Arrival, and most recently Blade Runner 2049 have proved themselves as good examples of this. Alex Garland, director and writer of the excellent 2015 film Ex Machina, has made a second attempt at crafting another sci-fi masterpiece in the form of Annihilation, an attempt that, for me, is successful.Annihilation stars Natalie Portman as a cellular biologist whose husband (Oscar Isaac) suddenly returns after a year on a mysterious military operation. He falls into a coma, and they are taken to a secret facility on the edge of a large environmental disaster zone known as ""The Shimmer."" Little is known about this zone and its origin, and most things that go in never come out. Portman's character, along with a supporting cast portrayed by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny, venture into ""The Shimmer,"" discovering a strange environment with terrifying horrors, beautiful landscapes, and mutated creatures. Obviously, going into much more detail past this point would ruin the film's best attributes, which I will discuss later. Anyone who wants to know more will have to see the film themselves.The thing that makes Annihilation stand out from an increasingly large library of sci-fi films is its ability to get you thinking. Many films in the sci-fi genre, whether they be meticulously crafted masterpieces or money-seeking garbage, pose questions to their viewers. Some of these films will answer these questions without much payoff, and some will toy with you and make you ponder before finally revealing its secrets before its conclusion. However, there are a select few sci-fi films that ask questions but never answer them. Rather, they provide clues and hints to the audience that allow them to draw their own conclusions, forcing them to linger on the film's meaning for a long time. My favorite example of this last category is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is still regarded as a perfect science fiction film by many critics. Annihilation very much flows in the same vein of filmmaking as 2001. While some of the baseline questions about the film's plots are answered, its ending left me baffled, confused, and shocked. These may sound like the adjectives one would use to describe something less-than-positive. On the contrary, I was delighted. I saw Annihilation two nights ago, and I am still thinking about the questions it offers and what they mean. It is a film that demands multiple viewings, a demand that I will surely be obliged to fulfill.There are many other things about Annihilation that make it a great film. Its visual effects are superb, and they bring out the beauty (and horror) of the mysteries inside ""The Shimmer."" It also features great sound editing, which will surely creep you out, put you in awe, and give you chills many a time. If I had to pinpoint any flaws in Annihilation, they would be very small. These include some convenience in its storytelling, including one or two instances of deus ex machina. These also include a small plot detail that, even after thinking about the film for hours, still doesn't seem necessary to me. Of course, my curiosity will bring me to watch the film again, so this is something that could be reconciled. Otherwise, the film is near-perfect science fiction, and it suggests that Alex Garland still has much more to offer the film industry to satisfy nerds like myself.Annihilation stands out in a world of mediocre science fiction films, reminding me why I love to watch movies. It offers gorgeous visuals, intense thrills, and a mind-boggling ending that will make you think until your brain is tired. Alex Garland proves that he has a handle on the science fiction genre with his second round as writer/director for a film. I will certainly remember Annihilation for a long time, and I hope that other audiences will as well. Annihilation gets 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.","Annihilation",4569,3.8,-0.7
"4570",1.5,"  Some parts of the movie were entertaining, but in the end I left the theater wondering what the hell I had just watched?.................confused!","Annihilation",4570,3.8,2.3
"4571",2,"  Very disappointed for two reasons: First, the director used the time-honored techniques intended to frighten the audience; so time-honored in fact that they have become cliches in films. Secondly, the similarity to J. G. Ballard's The Crystal World and Stanislaw Lem's Solaris were too obvious for me to ignore and leaves we wondering whether the author/ director suffer from a lack of originality..Why tromp through the jungle to get to a lighthouse when you can take a boat; like duh?","Annihilation",4571,3.8,1.8
"4572",4,"  DC has yet to produce a proper Swamp Thing movie, but Alex Garland's Annihilation makes a fine substitute, having beautifully dark lessons in biology, gore, trippy sci-fi, and life's meaning.","Annihilation",4572,3.8,-0.2
"4573",5,"  This film was visually beautiful. The colors and scenery we're just wow. I was on my toes throughout the whole movie. The story was very original. In most movies I feel like I can expect what's going to happen next, but in this one the most unexpected things would happen and I loved that about it. Definitely on my list of favorites.","Annihilation",4573,3.8,-1.2
"4574",2,"  So promising, but so disappointing.","Annihilation",4574,3.8,1.8
"4575",3,"  Interesting twist on science fiction thrillers. The movie explains concepts simply and depicts images beautifully. Despite a weird conclusion, it is open for interpretation and leaves watchers thinking.","Annihilation",4575,3.8,0.8
"4576",1,"  This was a terrible conversion of the book. The movie seems to focus on the art aspect, creating an environment of color and quality CG, but fails to provide any type of motivation to make it through another 5 minutes... For most that hadn't read any of the series, you may question what is occurring and think what's with the psychologist talking unusual... For those that read the book, missing key elements that made the book amazing are missing- even a twist on the meaning of the title Annihilation...","Annihilation",4576,3.8,2.8
"4577",4.5,"  In effort to avoid spoilers I think I'll just say that overall, Annihilation offers something very different. I can imagine many won't be up for it, but it's a great trip if you open your mind to it. Exceptional cast and writing create some of the most vivid and believable characters I've ever seen. And, I especially loved the juxtaposition of such horrific concepts displayed in such aesthetically beautiful ways- literally a visual manifestation of the story's main theme.","Annihilation",4577,3.8,-0.7
"4578",5,"  I loved it. What a crazyass film!","Annihilation",4578,3.8,-1.2
"4579",0.5,"  Awful movie. The pacing was excruciatingly slow. Incredibly convoluted. I felt like you needed to be high to watch it or something. Just don't waste your time. How does this have such a high review score?","Annihilation",4579,3.8,3.3

"4582",0.5,"  I am going out of my way to make sure people know how stupid and ridiculous this movie is. It tries.. oh it tries and the harder it tries the dumber it gets, I'm going to assume that everyone involved in the making of this movie lacks integrity and personal pride. Ridiculous. Pointless. Wasteful.","Annihilation",4582,3.8,3.3
"4583",5,"  I predict one of the best movies of 2018.","Annihilation",4583,3.8,-1.2
"4584",5,"  As a lover of scifi... This is among my top three that I've ever seen. A mind-bending mystery that slowly unravels against a darkly beautiful and truly original interpretation of a mutated section of Earth. The story has a huge amount of heart, as do all the characters, which really tie the whole thing together. So many scifi movies are cold, distant, stylish, and devoid of feeling. Not this one. The soundtrack was perfectly paired with each scene... Simple folk guitar pickings as the troop wanders The Shimmer, as well as viscerally haunting synth layers with choral voices and strings. I just saw it for the second time and appreciated it even more. I left the theater both times with an elevated sensation in my mind; I like that this film made me not only think, but go through an actually mind-opening experience. A true art piece.","Annihilation",4584,3.8,-1.2
"4585",0.5,"  Warning. You have to be tripping acid to understand or even begin to grasp this storyline. Once you're sufficiently altered I'm sure you'll enjoy this psychedelic trip to ""Annihilation."" In the end, all that's getting annihilated is your brain cells. While the visual effects are quite engaging I believe I have seen similar if not identical simulations on my iTunes visualizer. I'm sorry to report that this movie is nothing but a lackluster bag of cheap thrills non-existent storyline, and poor acting, all encased in a world altered by an oil-slick lens filter.","Annihilation",4585,3.8,3.3
"4586",4.5,"  Annihilation is an intriguing film from beginning to end. Its a movie for intelligent people who likes to challenge their minds. If you are looking for a simple plot or a fun adventure, then this movie is not for you. It is Sci-Fi, yes but its more a physiological thriller that will leave wondering for days.","Annihilation",4586,3.8,-0.7
"4587",4.5,"  Slow but methodical. After sitting with the film after a few hours I feel like it's more metaphor than sci-fi in the aliens from another planet sence. All the performances are stellar.","Annihilation",4587,3.8,-0.7
"4588",3,"  odd pacing and poor direction, lead to unlikable and uninspired characters. There were plenty of interesting subjects but i never was invested enough to care. By no means a terrible movie but a lot of wasted opportunity","Annihilation",4588,3.8,0.8
"4589",5,"  Trippy and beautiful, with a dash of nightmare fuel... Sure, there are some clunky parts that feel like studio notes demanding more backstory, but all in all this is a movie that should be seen in a theater with a great sound system. The last 15 minutes will make this a cult classic for sure.","Annihilation",4589,3.8,-1.2
"4590",5,"  There is some new stuff to see here. Many reviewers will claim it is a mix of Arrival, Aliens, and other films but in fact, you have not seen this movie before. There are some new ideas, and the visuals are absolutely eye popping and unlike what you've seen elsewhere. It is definitely worth seeing on the big screen, to appreciate the superb art direction and special effects which blend together beautifully. You have NOT seen this film before, it is well worth the trip.","Annihilation",4590,3.8,-1.2
"4591",1.5,"  Rotten Tomatoes ratings have become extremely unreliable and inaccurate. The hype machine has a stranglehold on you guys lately. This was worthy of a high 50s rating at best. 2hrs where nothing happens. The characters have zero chemistry. Then something happens. That ""something"" is completely random and obnoxious. Some downright terrible CGI...I got to the movies A LOT and it was nice to have good reviews to make a decision on what to see. Then again, it's entirely possible that people have extremely poor taste. Sorry to everyone who worked hard on this as I highly respect their abilities and prior works. Arrival was a genius film. As for this one save your money and time on this one. Don't even bother renting it.","Annihilation",4591,3.8,2.3
"4592",4,"  I was really surprised by Annihilation. It's a sci-fi/horror/thriller. It's equally weird, intriguing, and unsettling. Basically, what Prometheus should have been.One of the most visually unique films I've seen. There is so much memorable imagery, beautiful, creepy, and sometimes both at once. The whole film has a unique style that I dig. The lightning has a sunsetsey 70's feel to it. Rather than a traditional score, a good portion of the music goes for a folksy style, which actually meshes very well with the swampland the characters are trekking through.I've heard complaints that the film is too slow. Personally, it went fine with me. I don't think there were any scenes they could've cut. However, some of the dialogue does slow things down sometimes. It's very deliberate and intellectual -ish and doesn't always sound natural. Though this mostly occurs in the opening chapter where all the exposition comes from. (Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is especially a bit of a boring chore to get through in beginning. Can't tell if it's the dialogue, her acting, or a bit of both.)","Annihilation",4592,3.8,-0.2

"4597",4.5,"  While this didn't necessarily ""blow my mind"" in any way as some have experienced, I still have nothing but great things to say about 'Annihilation'. Filled with original ideas, terrific scares, and excellent performances this is a stunner of the science fiction drama, which only so rarely gets something this fresh and intriguing. Whatever Alex Garland is eating for breakfast every day don't let him stop!","Annihilation",4597,3.8,-0.7
"4598",5,"  Alex Garland's sophomore film is nothing short of perfect. The visuals in this high-concept sci-fi horror film in conjunction with the performances given by the exceptionally talented women in it are only two of reasons this film is destined to be a classic.","Annihilation",4598,3.8,-1.2

"4600",5,"  Solid Sci Fi, mostly female cast that doesn't feel forced, can be a bit slow. But brilliant all around.","Annihilation",4600,3.8,-1.2
"4601",4,"  A smart, provocative sci-fi gem that digs deeply into the issue of how humanity is based on self-destruction. Several good scares, cool visuals and some really deep thoughts on what could potentially be the end of human kind.","Annihilation",4601,3.8,-0.2
"4602",0.5,"  This movie is profoundly terrible. You have been warned.Annihilation is at best a straight to video B movie.People will tell you that the visuals a great. No it is standard CGI farePeople will tell you that the score is great. No it is completely forgetableThe plot and characters are so stupid that you have to wonder how the screen play was approved. There were no deep scientific questions, there was no profound meaning. Basically the movie throws a bunch of incoherent nonsense at you and hopes you will be fooled into thinking it is profound.","Annihilation",4602,3.8,3.3
"4603",2,"  It was ok. The movie was interesting and suspenseful, but it falls flat at the end. It keeps you guessing at what is going on. Then it ends and you are still not sure. The so called science of the movie doesn't make sense and there. There are a lot of holes in the logic.","Annihilation",4603,3.8,1.8
"4604",3,"  This one is WAY out there. I guess it was entertaining if this is your first exposure to the story. I just think it was a little to ""heady"" to make for a good movie. Still a fun watch though.","Annihilation",4604,3.8,0.8
"4605",5,"  Annihilation is at once intelligent, horrifying, beautiful, emotionally resonant and deeply thought-provoking - all the hallmarks of great science fiction.If you happen to be in Canada, China, or the US, go see it on the big screen!","Annihilation",4605,3.8,-1.2
"4606",5,"  The cinematography is beautiful. The story is told in a way that allows the viewer's imagination to explore purposeful gaps in the narrative, and the writing and story-telling is successfully non-patronizing.","Annihilation",4606,3.8,-1.2
"4607",5,"  After over ten years of not caring enough to make an account on here, I made a Rotten tomatoes account to give this movie 5 stars. It's likely the only review I will ever write on Rottenness tomstoes. This movie is, almost exclusively, perfect. Incredibly intelligent, almost too intelligent in some ways. I didn't have my interpretation figured out until the morning after watching, which I love. I love that I can't stop thinking about it. Everything is so intelligently executed and designed, it's the science fiction movie I didn't think I deserved but so desperately wanted.","Annihilation",4607,3.8,-1.2
"4608",5,"  Best Sci-fi movie I have seen in quite a few years. Visually stunning and the score is simply captivating ( the song ""Alien"" could tell a story just with sound, it's awesome). Love the deeper meaning that sometimes things have no meaning or purpose - the world just keeps changing, not for the better or for the worse, but for the ""different"". Overall, I love it ;made me create a rotten tomatoes account for heaven's sake!","Annihilation",4608,3.8,-1.2
"4609",5,"  A phenomenal depiction of the very real psychological struggles that the cast encounters when confronted with something so beyond our understanding. Their search for answers through this beautiful, yet hostile anomaly leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout the duration of the film. Alex Garland delivers a true spectacle that defy's modern trends on what science fiction is.","Annihilation",4609,3.8,-1.2
"4610",2,"  No doubt this film is full of visual effects, but the story and pace lagged considerably. I am sure there is technical merit; however, the film itself seemed bland and often unnecessarily puzzling.","Annihilation",4610,3.8,1.8

"4613",5,"  It's a very neat movie. None of the scenes is dispensable.","Annihilation",4613,3.8,-1.2
"4614",4,"  This is an amazingly fresh and different take on a sci-fi movie. Well worth seeing if you like horror and thought provoking movies. It doesn't follow the average formula for such a movie and the ending will really make you think. It's not just a 'last person standing' type of film and I really enjoyed it.","Annihilation",4614,3.8,-0.2
"4615",5,"  I loved it. It's moody and weird much of the time, but that's fine with me. Some very intense scenes.","Annihilation",4615,3.8,-1.2
"4616",4,"  Between a 7/10 and 8/10, Annihilation is some heady nightmare fuel, but its most striking quality may be how little it has in common with the current trends in mainstream science fiction.","Annihilation",4616,3.8,-0.2
"4617",0.5,"  THIS WAS A FANTastic sci-fi premise, but was unfortunates poorly executed by all parties. The direction seemed completely absent. The script was an embarrassing amateur hour of clunky exposition, unmotivated outbursts, and bland characters. I didn't care about any of the characters. They were so generic and poorly drawn. Natalie Portman gave the worst performance of her career. IT wasn't WAS truly awful. THe only one of the female scientist that seemed to Ben able to emote and show even a little depth was the very minor character of the physicist. All of the big parts, from the older woman to the fake hot-tempered one, were just outlines. It was like a boy band - she's the hot one, she's the smart one, she's the badass, she the sensitive one. In addition to these faults, the movie was long and slow and quiet. The CGI was amateur as well. The story after the premise wasn't laid out was hard to follow. There were plot holes everywhere. There were unmotivated actions and responses that were no credible. This was a terrible waste of time. But it was inspiring. If something this bad can attract a star and wide release, anybody can make a movie.","Annihilation",4617,3.8,3.3
"4618",5,"  Awesome movie! Will be going back for a second time to pick up on stuff that I missed the first run through. Mind blowing movie with so many layers. Nice to see a good cerebral sci-fi movie come out.","Annihilation",4618,3.8,-1.2
"4619",4.5,"  if Apocalypse Now and Arival had a baby, that Stanley Kubrick directed, this would be that movie. Its very open to interpretation of what makes you... well you.. and at what point do you cease to be that idea of self. Its somewhere between arthouse and intellectual sci-fi. I am sure there will be psychology courses that cover the topics this movie approaches. There is so much to unpack, even after the movie is over.","Annihilation",4619,3.8,-0.7
"4620",3.5,"  I loved Ex Machina, so of course wanted to see Alex Garland's new movie. There were some great visuals and it was scary, creepy, sometimes beautiful, but where Ex Machina had moments where the characters were having fun this movie is dour throughout. There are mysteries here, sure, but the ending fits into the idea that being ambiguous means the movie is good and ""thought-provoking."" Honestly, considering how the rest of the movie went, I'd be more surprised if the ending WAS clear. Especially since after Ex Machina, ambiguity is expected.I'll give three and a half stars because there are some truly striking visuals throughout, but the movie seems far too in love with its bleakness to be a classic.","Annihilation",4620,3.8,0.3
"4621",5,"  I think a good chunk of viewers did not fully comprehend this film. Annihilation is not just a movie, it's an experience. It's full of meaning those at the surface need to grasp. I came in expecting a sci-fi thriller, but I left with something more. Annihilation presents us with stunning visuals and entrancing music. As big of a fever dream as it feels, I think that was the point. To make it so bizarre that only those who dipped below the surface would be able to understand. This movie may look like nothing but nonsense to some, but to me, it was a work of art. The characters, the plot, the visuals, the score, the concepts. Each and every part of it was magnificent, and I'd definitely see it again.","Annihilation",4621,3.8,-1.2
"4622",4.5,"  To critique the film without mentioning the word ""psychedelic"" would be disingenuous. The slow-burn, intensely-cerebral nature of the film embodies everything that the psychedelic experience can radiate. Striking aural immersion, jaw-dropping visuals, shades of terror, and seemingly infinite perplexity deliver thrills and nuance that subvert modern tropes existing in the majority of science fiction and horror films today. Annihilation serves far more as an experience that raises questions about the nature of the human psyche and biology than concrete ideology. An experience that echoes long after it is over.","Annihilation",4622,3.8,-0.7
"4623",5,"  This film should be one of the highest rated of the past decade. It's part of a Science Fiction reawakening in the past few years that includes masterpieces like Arrival, Ex Machina, Blade Runner 2049, and Moon if you want to reach back that far. It's films like this that point out the flaws of rating sites like Rotten Tomatoes. While it certainly deserves a higher critic score it's the audience score that's truly disheartening.","Annihilation",4623,3.8,-1.2
"4624",5,"  wow, crazy, awesome , just wow","Annihilation",4624,3.8,-1.2
"4625",5,"  Different concept. A definite mind bender. An original new idea and far from a remake of any other movie like itself. It was great to see a new idea and not the same old movie that gets remade every few years.","Annihilation",4625,3.8,-1.2
"4626",5,"  An amazing, terrifying and wondrous and sometimes psychedelic foray into science fiction. Deviates in many ways from Vandermeer's trilogy yet somehow remains true to it in all of its nihilistic beauty.","Annihilation",4626,3.8,-1.2
"4627",3,"  The movie kept me interested for sure - with some mystery, some suspense and the leading lady. It was interesting to see what the whole thing was about and I am not sure I exactly know. I did not ponder so much as just think it was a good movie and enjoyed it. Some may not be as easy going about no firm answers.","Annihilation",4627,3.8,0.8
"4628",5,"  This is a unique, tense, and awe-inspiring movie. It's probably not for everyone as it really doesn't try to entertain but for fans of sci-fi and high-quality filmmaking, I think this is one of the best in a while. With Ex Machina and now this Garland is quickly becoming one of the most exciting filmmakers working today.","Annihilation",4628,3.8,-1.2
"4629",0.5,"  Too much to process! No clear direction...didn't make sense in the end","Annihilation",4629,3.8,3.3

"4634",5,"  Much better than I expected. It is not Ex Machina (which I loved) and that is a good thing and it is not Arrival (which I liked) and that is also a good thing. It was unique and kept my interest to the very end.","Annihilation",4634,3.8,-1.2
"4635",0.5,"  This movie is really boring and not worth the money to watch and will waste your time.","Annihilation",4635,3.8,3.3

"4638",1,"  now way. these critics must of been relatives. So many blank spots and story does not lead you anyplace but confused.","Annihilation",4638,3.8,2.8
"4639",5,"  A mind-blowing, sophisticated sci-fi tale masterfully brought to the screen by director Alex Garland, who has upped his game considerably here, even outstripping the success of his previous work, ""Ex Machina."" The film's richly layered, deftly nuanced, insightful script, combined with gorgeous cinematography and an inventive production design, make for riveting viewing. Note, however, that this is not a picture to be watched casually or when one is easily distracted. But an attentive screening is sure to captivate, providing much to think about in terms of metaphysics, spirituality, existence and evolution -- and possibly forever changing one's views on these heady subjects.","Annihilation",4639,3.8,-1.2
"4640",5,"  Beautiful film. Enjoyed it more than I did Black Panther. I dont have a single bad thing to say about it. Great score, story development, CGI, amazing performances. 8/10 in my book.","Annihilation",4640,3.8,-1.2
"4641",2.5,"  The premise of a meteor bringing the ""things"" that you'll learn of during the movie was difficult enough to swallow. Then they pile on ultimately unexplained weirdities that left me weary and unsatisfied.","Annihilation",4641,3.8,1.3
"4642",1.5,"  Yuk: boring, unsatisfying. Portman is excellent with the stuff she had to work with.","Annihilation",4642,3.8,2.3
"4643",2.5,"  Remember when alien movies were just about little green men or robot humanoids coming to conquer Earth? Annihilation is another in a long line of modern sci-fi films to be more interested in the philosophy than the practicality of extra-terrestrials. But unlike Under the Skin or Europa Report, its ponderous nature never quite reaches its point. It's definitely a metaphor for something, but what? Aging? Marriage? Dementia? Time? Death? Perhaps a second-viewing would clear some of this up, but then I'd have to slog through this movie again.An unknown object has crashed onto earth, causing a slowly growing ""shimmer"" wall that seems to make anyone who enters it disappear. In so many ways, it's just a lesser version of classic films. Like Tarkovsky's Stalker, it's comfortable with saying ""I don't know"", but more out of confusion than intrigue. Like Villeneuve's Arrival, it uses alien beings to talk about humanity, but with little emotional impact. Like Carpenters' The Thing, its unexpectedly and brutally gory, though not as technically impressive.However, it's a hard movie to write-off or be complacent about, given its strangeness and ambition. The bursts of horror are fun and unique, with cool creatures and a steady directing hand. Most of all, it's visually striking cinematography and often quite beautiful production design are undeniable. Most of its issues seem to stem from the writing, which isn't just thematically unfocused, but also just full of cliched dialogue. With Ex Machina, Alex Garland made a strong impression with that debut. And even with all of Annihilation's script problems, his camera's eye and brainy tendencies keep him as a filmmaker worth watching.","Annihilation",4643,3.8,1.3
"4644",5,"  Officially my all-time favorite movie. Truly incredible and the epitome of feminism. So impressed by Natalie Portman!","Annihilation",4644,3.8,-1.2
"4645",2,"  SLOW, poor casting, not compelling or believable at all. ONLY slightly interesting feature is the visual effects and ending. Conspiracy giving it high marks... Just plain boring and I almost walked out....everyone in our theatre agreed","Annihilation",4645,3.8,1.8
"4646",1,"  This was the worst sci-fi movie I have seen in many years. In a word, ludicrous.","Annihilation",4646,3.8,2.8
"4647",5,"  Annihilation is directed by Alex Garland, and is based off of a massively successful novel by Jeff VanderMeer. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and having finally seen it, I am blown away. Annihilation is incredible. Alex Garland had already knocked it out of the park with Ex Machina, and Annihilation is even better. This is full on 2001 style insanity, and it is glorious. Everything about this movie is so finely crafted and carefully constructed that the finished product is like almost nothing i've ever seen. The performances are all exceptional, especially from Natalie Portman. She has a lot of difficult work do, and she handles it with such a resolve. The standout in the film, is how it looks. Alex Garland has crafted a visual wonder. Then comes the end. No spoilers, but the final 20 minutes of the film are so insane, that the only thing I can compare it to is the ending of 2001. This movie also has one of the scariest scenes of the decade so far. Again no spoilers, but the way tension is created is masterful. Honestly, 2018 is gonna have to try really hard to give me a movie that is better than Annihilation.","Annihilation",4647,3.8,-1.2
"4648",3.5,"  SPOILER ALERTI found the ending of the movie to be rather an upbeat one.Each of the woman scientists, Lena, Ventress, Josie, Anya, Cass, have a serious fault in their lives.Lena a cheater, Ventresss, sick with cancer, Cass - loss of a child, but we never find out how (was it her fault?), Josie, cutting herself (to feel alive, or feel something, why?) and Anya a recovering addict. They are seriously injured either mentally, or in in Ventress and Josie's case, physically. Are they looking for an answer to the shimmer, or are they looking for an anwer to what they perceive to be their shitty, hopeless, closed off lives. Lena buries herself in her work to forget that she probably dorve her husband into a dangerous situation. They are looking for CHANGE, and that is what the shimmer is - CHANGE, for good or bad, but it definately changes people. It changes everything on earth to be bigger (the alligator), brighter (all the flowers), for better or worse.It is also more dangerous, so with change comes danger. The shimmer is a metaphor for our earth changing and we as humans are changing with it, some get cancer from its toxins, some can't go on because of a loss in our lives. The shimmer is the HOPE for a change to make our lives better. Our human cells change and intermingle with that of the shimmer. From the opening scene the movie is all about cell division like cancer changing, doubling forever increasing and going on, isn't that what the shimmer will do if it isn't stopped. But it is stopped, or is it. Maybe the shimmer is like cancer changing and mutating into something else and is immortality in its very nature. Maybe the shimer itself adapted and changed into something else inside Lena and Kane. Don't forget Lena tested her blood and it had changed, so she was already different before she went to the lighthouse. Who was it that left the lighthuse at the end, was it Lena or her double. It doesn't really matter because the ending, when she meets her husband (who has already changed and can't drink the life blood of earth - water) they embrace, intermingling who and what they are into something new, (just like in the shimmer when you touched something it changed your structure). This is perhaps a new beginning for their life together. One where they maybe don't remember that Lena cheated and that Kane ran away. To me it was a hopeful ending, the shimmer was burned away for new things to begin, just like a forest fire spurs new growth. Maybe it isn't too late for earth and the humans on it to recover, but we must realize it soon, or the shimmer will take over.","Annihilation",4648,3.8,0.3
"4649",3.5,"  I enjoyed 95% of the film, and 75% of it was quite gripping. It was visually stimulating and unique, and well acted -- but underdeveloped characters and odd special effects stop this from being an award winner. [3.5 stars]","Annihilation",4649,3.8,0.3
"4650",5,"  There were some things from the book that i wish were preserved in the movie... but overall the movie was its own beast and was definitely worth watching!","Annihilation",4650,3.8,-1.2
"4651",0.5,"  If I could give it zero stars, I would. Pure garbage. A nothing ending where absolutely zero closure. Full of plot holes and loose ends. Natalie Portman's worst job of her career. An affair in the middle of the movie has nothing to do with anything in the plot. So mad we paid money for this and wasted two hours of our life.","Annihilation",4651,3.8,3.3
"4652",4.5,"  Such a good sci-fi horror flick with stunningly beautiful images of mutations. Plus an A+ cast of leading women who brave going into the shimmer for a mission when no one has ever come back from that. It was well worth seeing and I wouldn't mind seeing it again.","Annihilation",4652,3.8,-0.7
"4653",5,"  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Wow! Who imagined this story? Someone with an incredible imagination, love movies where the story line could very well be a possibility. Go see it!!!","Annihilation",4653,3.8,-1.2
"4654",1.5,"  Kept waiting for the movie to begin, and then it was over","Annihilation",4654,3.8,2.3
"4655",4,"  There are parts of the movie where the silliness can be more perceived than its overall thematic statements, but then it goes into directions that become intricately fascinating. It's sad that this film is mostly marketed as a dumb popcorn action flick as it's more along the lines of Kubrick and Tarkovsky.","Annihilation",4655,3.8,-0.2
"4656",4,"  Fantastic movie that surprised me at every turn and left my jaw open for the last 20 minutes. Highly recommend!","Annihilation",4656,3.8,-0.2
"4657",5,"  *First things first. Annihilation is one of those types of movies that if you don't pay attention and just focus on getting action sequences, you will not understand the movie by the ending. Every word that is said in this movie from start to end is important and will hook you in from the beginning even before they enter the ""Shimmer"".*Alright now to the review. Like I said, once the movie started, I knew that this movie would focus more on story than just pure action, so I knew to pay attention to the dialogue. Once I did, this movie went from what seemed like an unoriginal plot at first to the most original movies I had ever seen at the theater in a way that will shock you in many ways those scenes deliver. It wasn't emotional to me, but beautiful,creepy, and intense all at the same time. Annihilation is worth the buck if you love these Suspenseful Thriller types of movies.","Annihilation",4657,3.8,-1.2
"4658",3,"  This second outing for Director Alex Garland stars Natalie Portman alongside a kick-ass, all-female cast. It revolves around Portman's character after the mysterious return of her thought to be dead husband (Oscar Isaac). And her journey into the mysterious and unknown ""shimmer,"" where he was assumed to be K.I.A., in order to find a cure for his failing health. The film is as beautiful as it is frightening. Garland's pace throughout the film has you unsure of what to fully expect and has you questioning what might be around the next corner. It captures a wonderfully twisted and nightmarish quality to it. Thinking back- having watched it twice in a row. It feels like a half-remembered dream. Which is pretty high praise considering that's what supposed to happen when people go into the shimmer. And yet, as the film progresses, it's pacing becomes to feel more sluggish than intoxicating. The more we know turns out to be the less we know. And it may become a frustrating task figuring out what the movie doesn't want to spoil for you. Garland chooses to let go of explaining too much, and yet the film still manages to back itself into some plot holes. But what the directore does instead is rely on fleshing out characters. Thaaaaat ultimately feel as though they might be better off dead. Ugh! Still though, if you leave yourself open to follow along and enjoy the ride, you're treated to some of the most bizarre and refreshing moments to be had in a theatre (Or on Netflix) in a long time. Only you can say whether it scores or if get's lost in the end zone. That's entirely up to your interpretation of what happens... in the shimmer. *ooOOOoo*3 stars","Annihilation",4658,3.8,0.8
"4659",5,"  only 66% like the movie... probably because they dont understand any of it","Annihilation",4659,3.8,-1.2
"4660",4.5,"  Annihilation is very complex and mysterious movie, but one of the best looking and interesting science fiction movies in a while. The movie follows a group of scientists into ""The Shimmer"", which is a secret quarantined zone home to many weird and suspicious activities. The group is all female, led by Natalie Portman, who puts in an outstanding performance as Lena. The supporting cast is also strong, with each playing their unique roles well. Oscar Isaac in particular is a standout in his flashback sequences with Natalie Portman, as both have strong on screen chemistry. Although the mystery of the film slowly unfolds, the pacing can be a little off at times. However, the movie does take time to get to know the character's backstories and explaining some of the complex and mysterious events and mutating creatures. There are some gruesome scenes that may discomfort some members of the audience, but they add to the intensity and mystery of the world. The third act is when everything finally gets explained and the backstory comes together. There is a lot of controversy over this final sequence and the ending. However, I believe it was well done and highlights the cinematography and creativity of the movie perfectly. Overall, Annihilation has some pacing problems in the second act and ""The Shimmer"" can seem very complex at times, but these minor flaws are overshadowed by standout performances (particularly Natalie Portman), beautiful visuals, and a very interesting science fiction story.","Annihilation",4660,3.8,-0.7
"4661",4,"  Thought-provoking with a touch of horror.","Annihilation",4661,3.8,-0.2
"4662",1.5,"  Simply confusing and terrible. Plus, who made those falte visual effects? I hope they don't get paid.","Annihilation",4662,3.8,2.3
"4663",2,"  Horrible movie. It was strange and not realistic. Very inconsistent. When something mirrors you then everything you do should be mirrored....parts. mirrored but in a delayed reaction. Someone was trippin' when they made this. Someone trained in combat just doesnt carelessly walk into a village, post or area without caution. Several people walked out laughing at how bad it was.","Annihilation",4663,3.8,1.8
"4664",3.5,"  If you like movies like 2001, Solaris, and Under the Skin you should like this movie. I enjoyed it a lot. The music score was phenomenal. That is something that has really stuck with me. Only complaint I have is that a lot of big moment scenes in the movie were shown in the trailer, but there is still a big surprise for the final scene.","Annihilation",4664,3.8,0.3
"4665",1,"  Sorry but I had high hopes for this movie but it was slow going...lost any respect for the main character because of infidelity and the ending was seriously...WTF!!!!","Annihilation",4665,3.8,2.8
"4666",2.5,"  Some of the acting was subpar. The psychologist made NO sense. The ending??????????????? Whatever!","Annihilation",4666,3.8,1.3
"4667",5,"  This is a very good movie, well made, well acted.","Annihilation",4667,3.8,-1.2
"4668",1.5,"  *****SPOILER ALERT******Annihilation ruined rainbows for me, maybe for everyone. Natalie Portman's acting couldn't save the sloppy, lazy script. The film beats the viewer over its head with the concept of cell duplication to the point it becomes insulting. They managed to put man-bear-pig in a serious sci-fi film with an anti-climatic demise to the heroine soldier. Rainbows. The visual effects were often shameful, the tracking was constantly off and they didn't bother to animate the deer so they would move independently as they naturally would. At times I could see where the matte painting stopped and the set started. People turn into flowers (which could've been beautiful and more meaningful if done well and shown). Rainbows. They turned aliens into a cheap fashion show. Rainbows. An awkward emotional alien-rape scene. Some of the acting was cringe-worthy, though the script definitely was the primary reason it came across as forced. Did I mention rainbow flares? They even put them in night scenes! They're so overused you can't even make a drinking game out of it. Also, why did they have to show Natalie Portman cheating on her husband and antagonize her with no resolution whatsoever. In the end, Alex will wish making this 40 million dollar extravaganza was a bad mushroom trip, though he may never come down. Rainbows.","Annihilation",4668,3.8,2.3
"4669",1,"  This movie SUCKS. I love sci fi and horror and this movie is a bloated, over-rated, badly acted piece of garbage. I normally don't comment on movies online but went out of my way to let people know about this. The fact that so many top critics praised really makes me question the whole system.","Annihilation",4669,3.8,2.8
"4670",2,"  I thought the movie lacked a credible ending and the explanation for the characters actions was questionable.,","Annihilation",4670,3.8,1.8
"4671",4,"  This visually sumptuous sci-fi thriller offers some nightmarish moments you won't soon forget. Natalie Portman is at the top of her game as a biologist, scholar, ex-soldier who searches for answers to some very big questions. One of the best films in this genre in recent years featuring five strong female characters. Bravissima!","Annihilation",4671,3.8,-0.2
"4672",4.5,"  Once again, I have to reinforce how much I love original science fiction films. Yes, Alex Garland apparently took some liberties with the source material, but the feeling I had watching Annihilation was unlike anything I have had in quite some time, perhaps since seeing Interstellar in 2014. The wide range of tone and emotion this movie can display is unbelievable. I went from being invested in the intellectual elements of this sci-fi feature, to beyond terrified of the creatures that inhabit ""The Shimmer"", to fascinated by the mind-blowing choices the film makes in the third act. In every sense, Annihilation is a unique piece of art.The main story thread sees Natalie Portman's 'Lena' team with Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), and Josie (Tessa Thompson) in an attempt to figure out why no human life form seems to come back after visiting The Shimmer. It's both a science fiction adventure film, as well as a psychological horror/thriller. All genres are equally as compelling to see play out here.While it can be a slow moving film at times, its methodical pace plays into the epicness of the ending in my opinion. You may not be as impressed or as shocked by the events of the third act if you don't get a confusingly plodding first hour and a half. And I say that in the most affectionate way possible. I don't like building up the suspense or anticipation for a film to people who haven't seen it, but it's worth noting that I'm still buzzing after it's been 5 days.There's no sense in trying to explain some of the events of the film or what it means, considering I myself am still trying to figure out beat for beat, and it's better to go into this film completely blind, as I mostly did. However, I can say that the performances (by an all female lead cast) are terrific, the special and practical effects are terrifying and beautiful, and the direction is brave. From a science fiction perspective, you can't really ask for any more than that.9.5/10","Annihilation",4672,3.8,-0.7
"4673",5,"  A brilliant beautiful and dark sci-fi film from Ex-Machina Director. A must see in theaters.","Annihilation",4673,3.8,-1.2
"4674",1,"  Oh, Dear..where to start... This is one of the most uninspired, utterly boring, slower than a turtle's crawl, stale, unimaginative, thought- not-provoking movie I have ever witnessed . Although most of the critics and the self-proclaimed ""deep thinkers"" giving this movie 5 stars would make you believe, this movie is a gloomy pile of self-pitty, stupidity, and nonsense designed for deeply depressed people who find joy in observing other equally depressed individuals portrayed on the big screen. And yes, some of you are right in stating that this movie is not for the mass audiences who would not be able to comprehend its illogical and pointless plot..It is made for those rare individuals with below average intelligence who are actually unable to think and ask questions but rather are willing to accept a few scientific words and conceptions thrown at them, a few weird scenes with creepy creatures and a few wooden characters at face value precisely because they do not understand anything that's going on but desperately want to fit with the smarter crowd. So lets examine the so called ""brilliant premises"" of the movie which seem to grasp the attention of the ""deep thinkers"". The idea of self destruction was introduced in the movie, as the psychologist said ""we all drink and smoke""...WOW self-destructing ourselves must be the idea of the century for these poor souls. What incredible imagination!!! Next is the scientific notion about programmed cell death- WOW has anyone heard about apoptosis, or the programmed cell death before? Obviously the intelligent ""deep thinkers"" haven't? What about Freud;s death instinct? Nope, never heard of it- go check it on google ""deep thinkers"". Actually the only interesting notion in the movie was the idea that cell were initially created to divide perpetually and they eventually stop dividing due to a faulty gene( not a new idea but interesting). Now let's talk about how slow paced and infuriatingly one toned this movie is. I don't know about you ""deep thinkers"" maybe you need more time to process things but I personally prefer when someone is talking to me to not pause for 1 minute between sentences and stare at me for another minute before he continues with the next torturous sentence. Yea, believe it or not I am that fast thinking, I can comprehend a whole speech without 1 minute pauses between each sentence. The sound, music and CGI effects are equally terrible - if want to imagine how the Shimmer looks, just go to the park, blow a soap bubble and Voila you will see the Shimmer through it.Now let's get down to the plot. There is this phenomenon happening at a local park that keeps enlarging and engulfing more territory. The government has sent multiple expeditions and drones but nobody comes back except one soldier who happens to be Natalie Portman's husband. He comes back to the house after 12 months absence, acting weird and out of character, then he starts throwing up blood. Natalie takes him to the hospital and they get ambushed by some special forces. Basically Natalie who is a professor of cellular biology wakes up and finds out about the Shimmer so she decides to join a team of psychologist, paramedic, physicist and another person to explore the Shimmer. Why would they go in after so many have failed without any clear plan of what they are going to do is mind-blowing on its own. But hey, let's not get to picky and try to find a reason or a plot in this mindless endeavor. So they go in and wake up with amnesia which seems to last only for the first few days, after that they remember everything even enough to recount the events when the last survivor Natalie comes out of the Shimmer. So the physicist gets pulled by a giant alligator into the water and stays there for s couple of minutes but comes out ...wait for it miraculously without a scratch. How is that possible when she should have come out without half her limbs you ask yourself- well let the ""deep thinkers"" figure it out, I am sure they will come up with something. So the big idea is that when you get into the Shimmer the thing/alien creature deconstructs your DNA - how exactly deconstructs it , is their a pattern, how does it choose to turn some people into glooming trees and blow up deconstruct others to their basic molecules(the psychologist's fate) is not explained or reasoned with at all. But, hey let's not forget this movie is not made for people who want to know, it is made for these rare ""deep thinkers"" who don't need to know or find reason or logic - like people on crack. So, one by one the explorers all get killed except Natalie who gets to the light house (the supposed home of the creature). By a drop of her blood the alien recreates this silver human looking being who starts to copy Natalie's every move. So, we watch her slow dance with this creature for a bit without any attempt on her part to understand it or try to talk to it, find its reasons for being on Earth..I mean didn't she just go in their to find out what is going on??? Instead she decides to give the alien a bomb and for another unknown reason the alien decided to pull the trigger and blow him/herself. Great ending right? When Natalie is questioned by the government people what did the creature want she says after a good minute or two of staring and thinking ""I don't know"".. Right, then why did you go in in the first place, dear? What the alien deconstructed your DNA and thinking to such a degree that it made you lose all purpose...And of course the end is mind blowing- the shimmer is gone, but now Natalie and her husband Kane (who is not her real husband any more but the alien) are possessed. Wow what a brilliant end for the ""deep thinkers"" For the rest of us intelligent people with sense of logic this movie is pure nonsensical trash, and uninspired at that.","Annihilation",4674,3.8,2.8
"4675",1,"  I loved Ex Machina, I think Natalie Portman is great, but this movie's a dud. Sluggish, senseless puree of half-baked themes and ideas. Plus the science makes no sense.","Annihilation",4675,3.8,2.8
"4676",4.5,"  From writer and director Alex Garland, Annihilation is about a team of researchers who go into this unknown zone that has appeared called 'The Shimmer' to investigate what it is, why it's here, and how it's growing and changing its surroundings so rapidly. I was a fan of Garland's last film he wrote and directed, Ex Machina, for his tightly written dialogue and mesmerizing scene development with great acting and a surprising amount of action as well. His work on that film transfers over beautifully to Annihilation with a substantially bigger budget and a wider variety of acting as well. Even though this script has substantially less dialogue than his last film, each and every line is executed beautifully and the audience feels the impact of every one as well. His direction in this movie is flawless with the proper use of slow motion and the mix of special effects and practical makes it mesmerizing every second the cast is in the shimmer. Like I said the dialogue is practically flawless with it's variety of characters and unique builds in this film. The twists written come across very well and are fleshed out beautifully with its amazing cast and great direction. Rob Hardy's work on cinematography is amazing with his offsetting shots and beautifully crafted scenes. With him working on Ex Machina with Garland they have now developed a system that is just pumping out more and more beautiful movies every few years now. Acting wise everyone did a flawless job in this film. Natalie Portman I believe has never done a bad or even a decent performance, when she hits the screen she's impeccable with every role, every character, every scene, every line of dialogue that she executes in every film she's in. Jennifer Jason Leigh did an amazing job once again as Dr. Ventress in this film, I grew a very big liking for her from her performance in The Hateful Eight. Even Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson did amazing jobs for their polar-opposite characters in this film. One of the biggest parts of this film is the make p done on the cast and it's by far the best looking makeup of the year. The scars on characters and tattoos being strategically placed on the characters makes this films story just more and more impactful with every watch. The blood and gore used is beautiful combined with great prosthetics and for gore and creatures as well. Annihilation I believe will be one of the best sleeper movies of the year with it's highly original sci-fi story and great direction and acting with a flawless blend of CGI and practical effects used. My only complaint has to be a subplot that attempts to flesh out Portman's character a bit more, I felt it's not necessary and drags the runtime out a little bit too long. Minus that it's a near perfect sci-fi movie. I have to give this film a 9.25/10","Annihilation",4676,3.8,-0.7

"4682",4,"  Annihilation is thinking persons sci-fi in the vein of 2016's fantastic Arrival. If it's a little too far fetched at times and perhaps not quite as emotional as Villeneuve's film, Annihilation is still powerful and its unique story and themes will offer up major food for thought for cerebral minded audiences. The film also benefits from terrific performances and gorgeous visuals, establishing a thoroughly dreamlike quality to the atmosphere. Alex Garland also punctuates his film with moments of sheer terror and beauty, alternating between terrifying monster battles and serene natural beauty. It all culminates in a dazzling and mind-opening climax that rivets and confuses. This is where the film could lose many viewers, but Garland is bold and ballsy and commits wholeheartedly. While watching the final ten minutes I was awestruck and tense, helped greatly by the moody score by Ben Salisbury, and even if I didn't quite grasp what the film was saying in these moments, I left the theater recreating and puzzling the pieces together. Audiences may vary in their interpretations, although similar themes will arise in most interpretations. Garland has here created a sci-fi film of human folly and self-destruction and visualizes this in the most extreme, metaphorical way. It is highly intriguing filmmaking, perhaps not fully satisfying but riveting and after Ex Machina, proves Garland is one to watch in this field. Rating: 84","Annihilation",4682,3.8,-0.2
"4683",3.5,"  It is definitely a beautiful movie the CGI is quite the spectacle but I felt the overall project shot the moon and fell short. Big ideas felt muddled and the ending was a letdown. The cast was forgettable as well, for a small team like that I need to feel for their safety but I didn't really care. Still it was a good attempt that was enjoyable enough, just doesn't reach the grand height of Alex Garland's Ex Machina.","Annihilation",4683,3.8,0.3
"4684",4,"  Pros: Natalie Portman really digs down and brings out emotions in herself and in the audience. Her character is immediately painted as damaged by her husbands death but her own misdeeds show who she is at her base. The visuals of the shimmer quickly go from beautiful and pleasing to intense and creepy. Very eye pleasing to the audience without taking too much from the story or trying too hard.Multiple scenes had me constantly moving from the edge of my seat to cowering from the intensity. Cons: The beginning was important to character building but the movie seemed to use some time building characters that should have been put into the ending. It seemed almost a little rushed and it creates more questions then answers (possibly by design).","Annihilation",4684,3.8,-0.2
"4685",1.5,"  If you've read the amazing trilogy that this movie is supposed based on, you will be sorely disappointed. I've never seen a movie less faithful to the novels than this one, and it wasn't in a good way. They turned a creepy psychological thriller into a Rambo-with-monsters movie with a happy-ish ending. The movie was missing basically everything that made the books great - (SPOILERS) the tower, the crawler, the psychologist's hypnosis, the way everyone was named by their profession, the journals in the lighthouse, the biologist's lack of connection to humanity, the mutant in the marsh, and the lighthouse keeper. Ouch!What a disappointment to fans of the books.","Annihilation",4685,3.8,2.3
"4686",2,"  The beginning was way too long, I mean we get it she's in love with her husband. I was expecting to see more animals with mutations, didn't! Cut out all the b******* in the movie it would have ran about an hour. I do not suggest going to see this in the theater. Maybe, I mean maybe, if you're bored and all your laundry is done in your dishes are done you have absolutely nothing to do and the choice is kill yourself or watch the movie, well watch the movie.","Annihilation",4686,3.8,1.8
"4687",4.5,"  what an absolute beauty of a movie, any movie that grabs and holds my interest is one thing, but to have me thinking about it after and days to come deserves some serious respectAlex Garland is without doubt my favorite director, dating back to a couple of my favorite movies 28days Later, The Beach, Sunshine and ExMachina Garland is an absolute genius with his directing and story tellingthis movie is for open minds, people who think about the world and life for what it offers. this movie was so intense and mind-boggling at every second. SPOILER: that bear creature with the voice! oh wow, how creepy and genius. music was so perfectly done as well in the final climax.","Annihilation",4687,3.8,-0.7
"4688",3,"  This was an entertaining movie. It had a bear attack scene like the leonardo decapricated movie , only freakier!! As a sci-fi movie, it had had some trippy concepts, that I am still trying to decide if they are nonsensical or not. As a sci-fi movie it is heavier on the fi, than the sci. The sci part is explained simply by one of the characters as ""refractions."" hmmm, bs basically, but in a real life situation, bs is probably all that would be available to explain a situation such as this without decades of government funded research. Overall, not really much of a resolution , , an entertaining movie. It gets the third star for the awesome soundtrack.","Annihilation",4688,3.8,0.8
"4689",2,"  Nothing much to ponder after watching, other than wondering if I saw the same movie as so many critics who rejoiced in it did. 3/4 of the film was a cheaply done typical Scifi/ monster flick. A lack luster attempt at connecting with the five women as each of their stories are revealed, comes out short and unconvincingly. The last 1/4 had some cool visuals ( two stars simply for them) but no ambiguity as to what was what at the end, nothing to discuss except why did I fall for the critics reviews when I know better than to do that. As it stands, the end was a major fail unless you weren't paying attention. Rodriguez should have have chosen something better to lose her virginity moving to the big screen with. Portman who always does well even when the script is lacking, seems very disconnected. The biggest issue for me is that it could have been the movie the critics think they saw , done differently , more thought, better dialogue , an end that made sense by what came before it. Instead it's a cheaply thrown together ho hum that ' could have been a contender' , so to speak.","Annihilation",4689,3.8,1.8
"4690",5,"  This movie was haunting as it was interesting. Natalie Portman does not disappoint, her range in this movie was amazing. I loved this movie and will more than likely see it again before it leaves the Box Office. I am still having tremors thinking about the scene with the bear. I never thought another movie would make a scene with a bear as traumatizing as the one in The Revenant. I was wrong, there are other avenues one can go and Alex Garland went there and went there hard. ""Help me."" I literally had a shiver go down my spine. The imagery in the movie was amazing, and I won't know until I go watch it again but I am sure the all the prismatic effects of the rainbow were backward. If you watch this keep an eye out for that. There is something else that has stayed with me from my viewing last night, and that's the plants found in the small community, you'll know when you see them. When Josie describes how they came to be that also made me shiver. Not just now, but while watching the movie. There was one scene that I scoffed at, and that's when Lena tells Kane ""They had plans to go up to the country..."" I looked at my girlfriend and asked her who even says stuff like that. Other than that slight blemish, the movie was great. Tessa was amazing. I feel like Josie was an underused character for such a phenomenal actress. This movie isn't for everyone, you're not going to find a nice wrapped up answer at the end of the film. Hell, I have a thousand more questions now then when I saw the trailer. I can't wait for the blu ray fo the special features! I highly recommend this movie. If you love beautiful special effects, if you enjoy great acting, if you like to be scared to your core; go see this film.","Annihilation",4690,3.8,-1.2

"4692",0.5,"  Awful. I don't understand all of these reviews. It was like they read the back of the book and then said ""ok yeah. But let's make it more...Anaconda...oooh, OOH! And make the love story BIG, it's now the driving force of the story! One last thing, the biologist needs to be an ex military, college professor that can competently gun down a giant croc if needed... and the cgi was just..bad. Sometimes, when you try to add meaning and over compensate for what you see as shortcoming, you strip away every piece of meaning and just turn it into a generic horror movie with ultra mundane motivations. Half a star for Oscar Isaacs being in it.","Annihilation",4692,3.8,3.3

"4700",3.5,"  Like writer/director Alex Garland's last effort, ""Ex Machina,"" ""Annihilation"" -- for me at least -- is a rich, entertaining, and scientifically thought-provoking ride from beginning to. . .about ten minutes from the end. And though this one's ending is definitely less of a buzzkill, there's still an overall sense of coldness and confusion that I can't seem to shake. So much of the film's first 90% feels so meticulously well thought-out and crafted. Whether its from a visual, thematic, or character-based standpoint, the majority of this movie rings true. It's just the last sliver of the running time that adds so much, yet explains so little, ultimately rendering everything into one of the most frustrating additions to the sci-fi genre I've seen in recent memory.","Annihilation",4700,3.8,0.3
"4701",5,"  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and was both visually and mentally stimulating. It drew me in and kept my attention the entirety of the film. You must be paying attention to pick up on the nuances hidden within the story this movie doesn't spoon feed you and hold your hand explaining every detail. If you aren't open minded you will easily miss the greatest parts of this movie. It was motivating and inspirational and left me wanting more. It is a non formulaic film that will leave you wanting to come back and watch it time and again.","Annihilation",4701,3.8,-1.2

"4704",4,"  Very creepy and really good. The sound editing, set design, and unique story are amazing; it's reminiscent of The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers without feeling like it's been done before. Very enjoyable sci-fi horror film.","Annihilation",4704,3.8,-0.2

"4706",3,"  Visually impressive, yes, and the movie certainly was patient with its storytelling. However, the pace of the movie, while deliberate and mostly engaging, detracted from any exposition or even discovery. Fans of Villeneuve's ""Arrival"" will find ""Annihilation"" to contain many of the same beats and tone, even if this movie is much more visually vibrant than ""Arrival."" The somber and humorless performances from the entire cast (with the exception of Gina Rodriguez) don't help to make the characters very memorable. The mystery of the Shimmer gives way to the mystery of the characters, and when the movie ended, I wound up with an experience that made me simultaneously full and empty.","Annihilation",4706,3.8,0.8
"4707",1.5,"  Alright, persons of variable gender identities, gather around! Grandpa D has another movie review and this time, I added sizzling passion to my words! On the chopping block is Annihilation (2018), the latest directorial effort from Alex Garland. This will be a spoiler-free review (as usual) and I'll be sourcing any plot material that was revealed from the already-released movie trailers. Now then, this is a feature with a lot of promise, given that Alex Garland delivered an amazing Deus Ex Machina for science fiction fare. The promise is of a movie that would deliver an alternative perspective from an all-female crew caught in a paradox: the world they enter is known to them and yet, it bears qualities that disrupt their personal grasps on reality, both physical and metaphysical. I was looking forward to this cast (helmed by a solid performance from Natalie Portman) and that excitement grew by the first half of the movie. I was expecting a psychological case study into how this crew will adapt and survive in this altogether foreign environment. As soon as introductions are finished, we learned that these characters were not superwomen but instead, (initially) written to be fractured souls looking for some form of redemption. It felt like a breath of fresh air to see these characters beginning to struggle with their physical inabilities in a genre riddled with incredibly-adept characters. I was expecting to be witness to the resourcefulness, cooperation, and intelligence of this crew of five, instead of the tried-and-true displays of muscle and brawn we've grown accustomed to. Unfortunately for my expectations, I bore witness to a rather unremarkable feature that readily devolved these characters into victims of survival-horror tropes.Once the second creature interaction occurs, it becomes plainly obvious that Mr. Garland will not deliver us the promises of fully-realized characters. After this creature interaction, the movie becomes as uninspired and stale as the creature designs themselves. My friend and I had quite a laugh at how poor the CGI seemed at times when we have been subject to remarkable CGI fare in the past. The ""big reveal"" and ending was even more disappointing in how uninspired the whole affair seemed. I had a suspicion that this movie was written to be too self-conscious: in a grand display of irony, the core theme of this movie (change by mutation) served to describe its chief pitfall. This screenplay is a mutated amalgamation from previous fare, such as Contact (1997 with Jodie Foster); Solaris (novel); creature design from Resident Evil; and The Astronaut's Wife (1997 with Charlize Theron). I am certain that if you've been exposed to the aforementioned material, you should have a good idea of how this movie will play out and the ending bore little-to-no surprise at all. Honestly, I would avoid it altogether. Save yourself the hassle and wait until it becomes free on Netflix.I give this uninspired turkey dinner 1.5 Wub-Wubs/5. I would tell you why the wub-wub, but then it might ruin the ""surprise"" for you. I just hope that Alex Garland does not become the next Neill Blomkamp.","Annihilation",4707,3.8,2.3
"4708",5,"  This was a trippy ass movie, especially the last few minutes of it. It was like 2001: A Space Odyssey for biology...lol. I'm still trying to process the movie.I recommend watching it alone and in a relatively empty theater. You need to think about it.","Annihilation",4708,3.8,-1.2
"4709",4,"  There will always be a debate as to whether you should read the book first before seeing the movie. In the case of Annihilation, I have never read the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer. I almost think that's an advantage going into this movie, as I had no idea what to expect or where it was going. Natalie Portman plays Lena, a biology professor at Johns Hopkins University. It's been a year since her husband, Kane (Isaac), went missing while serving in the military. One day he arrives home completely disoriented, unable to answer the questions she has for him. He starts having a medical emergency, but when they're en route to the hospital, a convoy of police intercepts them. Once they arrive on a secretive compound, Lena and Kane are separated and kept in isolation. She proceeds to learn there is ""a religious event, an extra-terrestrial event"" going on. It's called ""The Shimmer"" and it's slowly growing and taking over Area X. Kane was part of a group of soldiers who dared go into The Shimmer. No man, animal, or drone has made it out alive, except for Kane. There are four women (Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tuva Novotny) attempting to go back in, and Lena requests to join them in hopes of figuring out what happened to Kane.Annihilation is the latest from Alex Garland who received acclaimed for his film Ex Machina, also starring Oscar Isaac. He's becoming a sought after auteur in the futuristic sci-fi genre given these two films as well as writing Danny Boyle's films 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Annihilation continues to prove his staying power as it takes a strong vision to not let a film like this collapse under its own obscurity. It's a real think piece from very early on when we see Kane mysteriously appear out of nowhere. It becomes apparent there's a massive government conspiracy happening, which feels very X-Files like. The vagueness continues to widen once Lena starts to learn about The Shimmer. Garland wants the audience to feel as in the dark as Natalie Portman's character. There's a point when you realize that it doesn't necessarily go in chronological order, which completely throws off what you think will happen next. The longer Lena and the other soldiers are in The Shimmer, the more questions arise for the characters and audience, and the film rarely gives concrete answers. You're left constantly asking what happened before the women entered The Shimmer, what's going to happen next, and who can you trust along the way.For me, what was stunning is that The Shimmer is a place of full of puzzling contradictions. It's thought of as this negative force killing off the human population, but inside, it's full of rainbow hues and lush foliage as you find out that it's regenerating life from inside. There are other moments when Garland keeps this place dark and frightful with just enough jump scares to really keep you on edge throughout. There's an animal encounter that makes the bear attack in The Revenant look wimpy.Much like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, or even the more divisive Mother, it goes in some bizarre directions leaving it up to the viewer to bring their own religious background and environmental awareness to interpret what is going on. For some, it could be a religious allegory given its themes of survival and the eventual apocalypse. Garland could also be making a commentary on our never-ending hunger for knowledge, truth, and answers. We're always looking for more and demanding more of others. Maybe he's trying to claim our own greediness will be our own downfall as nothing is ever good enough. The lack of answers will no doubt frustrate half the audience. If you're someone who needs a movie to make sense and be wrapped up in a pretty bow in the end, then Annihilation won't be for you. Garland is most likely staying in tune with the book, but I applaud the openness and trust he has by leaving it up to the audience to interpret this material in whatever way they want. It's the kind of risk more filmmakers and studios ought to be making.Garland' last film, Ex Machina, had a minimalistic approach given its three person cast. He's certainly gone in the opposite direction with Annihilation taking on very complicated themes. Science Fiction always seems to work best when it goes all in with the mystery and intrigue that comes with the unknown. I never want the director to give me all the answers or rely on shock treatment to keep their film going. Garland sidesteps both of these. He utilizes some serious girl power with Portman leading the crew consisting of Jason Leigh, Rodriguez, Thompson, and Novotny each going into The Shimmer with their own skillset as actors and characters. We don't often see this kind of film with little to no male counterpart along the way acting like some dumb hotshot. I left Annihilation with a flutter of questions that may or may not be answered upon second or third viewings. My head was spinning in the best kind of way wondering what I had just experienced. Isn't that the way it should be when you leave a theater?Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? A polarizing film that may leave you with more questions than answers, but boy did I love it.RATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS","Annihilation",4709,3.8,-0.2
"4710",3.5,"  Not as good as 'Arrival', somewhat on the same prismatic wavelength as the remake of 'Solaris', this heady sci-fi is isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is. However, it serves up psychedelic thrills alongside Cronenbergian unease as flesh shifts and and minds warp, and it's great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh back on the map; with her growl and impenetrable toddler's stare, there's really nobody like her.","Annihilation",4710,3.8,0.3
"4711",4.5,"  Mid-budget films are an endangered species. Hollywood isn't willing to risk money anymore on those kinds of movies because it seems to think that only bloated-budget event movies can be profitable. That's probably why Paramount has been sabotaging Annihilation, its own movie, every step of the way. Demanding reshoots, giving the international release to Netflix, and a review embargo are things you only do when a movie sucks, which is bizarre, because Annihilation is the opposite of a bad movie.Writer/director Alex Garland's previous film, Ex Machina, was a small-budget indie affair, but he handles the upgrade to a major studio production like a natural. The movie opens in medias res, giving away just enough information for the viewer to guess the basic plot structure. This lulls the viewer into a false sense of familiarity, but as information trickles through each flashback, you can't shake the feeling that there's something terribly different from this seemingly conventional tale. No matter how hard I tried, I could never quite predict when the movie would jump back into the present. Annihilation employs one of the best uses of a narrator I've seen so far, even better than last month's I, Tonya or Molly's Game. Without giving anything away, it's important to keep in mind that despite the lack of voice-over, what we are seeing is merely a visual representation of a story being told by a character. Contributing to the disturbance is the cinematography and editing. Annihilation is an uncomfortably still movie. The camera takes its time and pans or zooms slowly, but it never lingers. Each shot begins precisely when there's new information to show and cuts precisely when that information ends. The few times that rule is broken are subtle, but they're deeply uncomfortable when they happen. Likewise, the center of attention in each shot is rarely framed the way a traditional movie would. Generally, Garland refrains from placing his characters and objects in the center of the screen. They're off center because there is something off about this story.Although Annihilation is based off the first book in a trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer, it takes a surprising amount of liberties with the source. Everything about the backstory, to the characters' identities, to subplots, right down to what equipment they use, differs from the novel in some way. Part of this is a cynical attempt to raise the stakes, to be sure, and part of it is simply because they started making this movie before the trilogy was even finished, but part of the differences are for the same reason sound is utilized the way that it is. Oftentimes, the movie is silent, but when it isn't, it's flooded with overwhelming non-diegetic sound. I wouldn't exactly call it music. No, it's something different, something refracted. It's the same with the narrative. Garland has refracted the story to make it his own, and in doing so, he proves why distributors should support cinematic auteurs, not hold them back. Hopefully, audiences will take notice, as long as they're willing to actively think about the film.","Annihilation",4711,3.8,-0.7
"4712",4,"  ""Annihilation"" is a visually stunning and consistently thrilling sci-fi adventure that benefits from powerful performances from its cast. However, the biggest bright spot in the film is the intelligent story that touches upon deep and thought-provoking themes, which you would need to be attentive to and analyze for yourself in order to be able to understand them.","Annihilation",4712,3.8,-0.2
"4713",3.5,"  APOCALYPSE HOW - My Review of ANNIHILATION (3 1/2 Stars)Q: What do you get when you mix together ARRIVAL, ALIENS, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, APOCALYPSE NOW, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, UNDER THE SKIN, THE WALKING DEAD and LOST? A: Writer/Director Alex Garland's (EX MACHINA) latest, ANNIHILATION, a moody but messy beauty for those who prefer their sci fi laced with ambiguity and weirdness. Natalie Portman plays Lena, a medical school professor, whose husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) has gone missing on a top secret military mission for a year and is presumed dead. He suddenly returns, gravely ill, as the sole survivor of ""the Shimmer"", an area near a coastal lighthouse which seems to be slowly but surely taking over the planet after a strange meteorite crashes. Everyone who has entered, with that one exception, has never returned. Soon, Lena joins a team of women to enter this odd, rainbow-colored oil slick of a blob and maybe, just maybe save the planet from...wait for it...annihilation!Told retrospectively, with Portman being interviewed by a government official, the trauma on her face tells us things definitely did not go swimmingly for her and her team, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh as the dead-inside leader, Gina Rodriguez as a badass, lesbian ""Vasquez from ALIENS"" type (and she excels in this film), Tessa Thompson as the quiet nerd, and Tuva Novotny as the most likely to become a ""red shirt"" since she's not as well known as her fellow actors. Regardless, it's nice to see women uniting and saving the planet in the type of film that has tended to lean male since the beginning of cinema. Although the film leans in on its concepts of environmental decay along with a headier theme of the need to evolve in a relationship with someone or die, ANNIHILATION has some supremely chilling scares, laced with some unexpected gore. At first, the Shimmer contains gorgeous fauna and flora and other assorted mutations, but something nefarious emerges. I won't say what it is, but the Smoke Monster and the Polar Bear from LOST have nothing on what Garland offers here. Tonally, the film feels quiet and sad. Garland wisely sticks close to his star, honing in on her every mood shift. Portman does wonderful work, showing smarts with her decisions despite her less than perfect past. Garland often over-extends his metaphors, almost blatantly telling us that the way we deal with our own inner struggles will directly effect the survival of our species. As such, things get more and more muddled as it goes along, and because he maintains such a serious tone, many may find the events a bit laughable. Personally, I liked the control Garland shows here. It's a solid piece of storytelling, with just enough unresolved mystery, and the creepy sequences lovers of this genre crave. I wish all of the characters, particularly Isaac's, had more dimension. I may have felt more in the end had the characters had more layers. Garland also wants to make this story about EVERYTHING!, biting off a little more than he can chew. But...Rob Hardy's cinematography captivated me in a similar way to that of ARRIVAL, spare, controlled, and precise. Mark Digby's production design looks gritty, strange, and gorgeous, sometimes in the same shot. Sure, the look sometimes tips into silliness which would have not looked out of place in the execrable WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, but it's an oddball aesthetic I haven't seen before. The sound design earned points, especially when a bear exhibits human qualities. I could have done without the Crosby, Still & Nash song ""Helplessly Hoping"", which not only seemed too on the nose, but its earthy harmonies seemed at odds with the visuals, much in the way THE WALKING DEAD sometimes employs strange music choices. It's still a beautiful song and does ground the story in reality, so it's not a totally bad choice. With EX MACHINA and ANNIHILATION, Garland clearly wants to challenge our humanity. Many may find his approach pretentious, but I like that he's taking chances. In the cookie cutter world of studio films, ANNIHILATION manages to break the mold a little. Are we at a tipping point again, where the majors are taking chances on such movies as MOTHER!, and now this? Love it or hate it, I truly hope so.","Annihilation",4713,3.8,0.3

"4715",4,"  In general, Annihilation was a good film and I highly reccomend seeing it","Annihilation",4715,3.8,-0.2
"4716",5,"  So freaking good. Best movie I have seen in awhile. Amazing audio during the movie. Must see in theatres. Felt like I was in a trance watching it.","Annihilation",4716,3.8,-1.2
"4717",3.5,"  ""Annihilation"" is a sci-fi thriller set in a mysteriously altered natural landscape. As such, it's more than a little reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 classic ""Stalker."" Both films are striking in their haunting images and conflicting impressions of imminent dread and wondrous discovery. Where they differ is that Stalker focuses on self exploration while Annihilation shines brightest during its moments of horror. There are echoes of movies like ""Alien"", ""Event Horizon"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in Annihilation, so if you enjoy sci-fi horror on any level, this is probably a film you'll like.It has some loose ends (including a largely irrelevant sub plot) and the third act is the weakest one, so this movie is not without its flaws. Its saving grace is some fantastic tension and the well crafted visuals which get progressively creepier until the film's ominous ending. Since we only got one interesting sci-fi film in all of 2017, it's nice to see one so early in 2018. Having made ""Ex Machina"" and now ""Annihilation"", I think it's fair to say that Alex Garland has some solid momentum as a fine director of modern science fiction.","Annihilation",4717,3.8,0.3
"4718",4,"  Great movie its a must see at the theatre.","Annihilation",4718,3.8,-0.2
"4719",5,"  ""Annihilation"" - Let's start right off with the grade: A+That's right. A totally original movie. Like nothing you've ever seen. Wildly imaginative. Mysterious. Thrilling. Thought-provoking. Beautifully told. Beautifully shot. Beautifully imagined. Beautifully acted. Few movies ever capture your attention like this. Go see it! I'll definitely be seeing it again soon.","Annihilation",4719,3.8,-1.2
"4720",1,"  Dialogue is horrible.","Annihilation",4720,3.8,2.8
"4721",3,"  ""Am I you? Are you me?""These are the pivotal words spoken late in 'Annihilation,' Alex Garland's directorial follow-up to his breakout hit 'Ex Machina.'The film is unequivocally high-concept--perhaps too much for its own good--in a dazzlingly-shot, heady sci-fi thriller. The more one understands biology--specifically cell biology--the more one is able to appreciate how tightly woven the plot is, and how insanely clever and audacious the ending turns out to be.","Annihilation",4721,3.8,0.8
"4722",3,"  The movie was unusual. It is well made and beautiful with good acting. But when leaving the theater, it left me wondering if I liked it. There was a lot of questions left when you walk out. If they had tied off more lose ends I would have liked it a lot more.","Annihilation",4722,3.8,0.8
"4723",5,"  Thinking person's sci-if horror. Natalie Portman is stellar.","Annihilation",4723,3.8,-1.2
"4724",1,"  Don't waste your money.","Annihilation",4724,3.8,2.8
"4725",3.5,"  Very interesting and original story like the book. Visuals are pretty amazing and it's not too predictable. There are some bad elements of the plot and movie, but overall it was a great sci-fi thriller. There is a lot to love and appreciate and there are some valid reasons to call this a ""bad"" movie.As a sci-fi fan, you know none of them are perfect and this is right up your alley, especially if you like movies such as Alien or Predator. If you're not into any of that, you might want to pass on this or wait for Netflix.","Annihilation",4725,3.8,0.3
"4726",2.5,"  A lot of style but little substance. Great cast but dull and lifeless acting. Entertaining and engaging but a little too much nonsense at times.The metaphors are obnoxious and in your face. Its one of those movies that seems smart and makes people feel smart for being able to follow the science buzz words to the end. A smart looking movie that dumb people that think they're intelligent will think is smart.","Annihilation",4726,3.8,1.3
"4727",3,"  More fascinating than fun and a good time overall but ultimately does not take full advantage of its brilliant premise. Annihilation comes up short when compared to Director Alex Garland's previous indie Ex Machina but as a Hollywood film, the movie is refreshingly abstract and as visually haunting as Ridley Scott's Alien, plus Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh bring an intensity to their roles that enhances the material.","Annihilation",4727,3.8,0.8
"4728",5,"  turned out to be one of my favorite sci-fi movie... indeed a dream,surreal experience","Annihilation",4728,3.8,-1.2
"4729",5,"  The Millennial child of Roadside Picnic & Solaris.","Annihilation",4729,3.8,-1.2
"4730",4.5,"  Annihilation was a great Sy Fy movie. Its kind of a better more exciting version of Arrival or some others. Natalie Portman is great, and beautiful of course, and the whole cast does fine. The suspense and mystery in this movie are what make this movie work. I highly recommend Annihilation to Sy Fy fans.","Annihilation",4730,3.8,-0.7
"4731",5,"  Alex Garland's directorial debut, Ex Machina, was a sleeper hit. He returns three years later with Annihilation; a film that defies your expectations of science fiction. You won't believe what you see, much like the characters in the movie question their surroundings. Packed with mystery and ambiguity, resting on the foundation of biology, it evokes a sense of curiosity. The concept of going into an otherworldly geographical area reminded me of Arrival, while the final 30 minutes had the same scope and dubious wonder as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Annihilation is your modern day Space Odyssey, and Garland is a modern day Kubrick. This is a spectacle to behold, and if you're an intellectual, it'll resonate with you for days, weeks, or even months. I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't wait to see it again.","Annihilation",4731,3.8,-1.2
"4732",4.5,"  Garland has done it again. A visionary classic. Though no actual reason for the movie, it definitely gives the audience a reason to gasp.","Annihilation",4732,3.8,-0.7
"4733",4.5,"  Good move, kept me interested the whole time. Beats watching the millionth SUPER HERO bs.","Annihilation",4733,3.8,-0.7
"4734",5,"  I plan to see it in theater again, and buy the UHD version when available for home. Nuff said... If you like this genre you'll love this movie. It's not without its flaws, but they are few and far enough between to be excused. It is one of those movies where you may think it is ""about"" some theme, on reflection later to realize for you it is about something else entirely. I've heard many interpretations of that, so will not spoil it for you. There are movies where I know that someday I will think back to when I first saw it. Fewer still where I know I will also remember my internal experience as vividly as the movie itself.","Annihilation",4734,3.8,-1.2
"4735",4,"  I don't know how to describe this film, I really enjoyed every minute.","Annihilation",4735,3.8,-0.2
"4736",4.5,"  4.5 stars, so hauntingly beautiful it's still crawling in my skin! Writer/Director Alex Garland pushes new boundaries in the sci-fi genre. Also Natalie portmann's best since Black Swan.","Annihilation",4736,3.8,-0.7
"4737",4,"  Annihilation rests safely on the shoulders of its fascinating and imaginative visuals and its solid direction does the thought-provoking source material justice making for an incredibly immersive experience that fans of unique philosophical works should definitely see.","Annihilation",4737,3.8,-0.2
"4738",3.5,"  Mostly stunning, cerebral, and bleak science fiction/thriller fusion. There is some heavy handed CGI and action sequences but the emotional and philosophical undertones hold your hand through the hiccups. There's a multitude of talent present in this film that mostly gets to shine but is veiled at times by some thin plot and inconsistency. Generally, Natalie Portman is a complete show-stopper once again and Alex Garland, as expected, has created yet another modern sci-fi mammoth. Not a perfect film but a memorable and unique addition to the genre.","Annihilation",4738,3.8,0.3
"4739",4,"  Greeat Sci Fi movie, terrific body horror violence and terrifying ideas in this movie. The bear making a certain noise made me smile in horrific it was. If you like The Thing/Alien/Under the Skin. Don't be a retard and see the boring ass Black Panther for the second time, support movies like this or else we won't see any more of these be made.","Annihilation",4739,3.8,-0.2
"4740",3.5,"  Did not find it interesting. How do these movies get rated so high.","Annihilation",4740,3.8,0.3
"4741",5,"  This is a movie that caters to an audience with a high EQ. People with low EQ just won't get it. Still, I don't understand how people can be so blind to the wonderful themes within this movie. The main idea is literally within N.Portman's opening lines. It uses cancer as a metaphor for the human existence. We think of cancer as ""death"" but like us, it's just a voracious organism that won't stop consuming and reproducing. It's not a malevolent act. It's just in our DNA. So much of what we perceive as our ""humanity"" or ""freewill"" is actually just our biology running its course.  However, there is the anomaly of love and empathy. It gives us hope that love is the one thing that trancsends our biology. It's the reason Oscar Isaac""s character was driven to go ""inside"", while simultaneously the reason his clone was motivated to venture ""outside"". Biology is what makes N.Portman cheat. Love is what gives her the strong motivation of guilt and makes her the only woman that truly wants to ""return"". The mirroring action scene at the end is a perfect way to show us what we really are. If we pitt our ""Humanity"" vs our Biology. Biology would match it blow for blow. If we try to escape our biology it will run us down. But if we accept and acknowledge it, it can allow an EXPERIENCE that cannot be quantified. There are many other themes refracted from this main shimmer, and if you only look at the obvious things illuminated you will be confused, but if you look and observe the light itself, you will see a novel love story.","Annihilation",4741,3.8,-1.2
"4742",4.5,"  Many will clamor and say ""What just happened? I don't get it!"" but it was such an intelligent and wild ride. Annihilation is visually intense and the sci-fi concepts will have genre fans contemplating it's ideas for days. Plan on going to see it twice.","Annihilation",4742,3.8,-0.7
"4743",5,"  If you are reading reviews, stop and just go see it. The less you know the better.","Annihilation",4743,3.8,-1.2
"4744",0.5,"  Horrible acting, plot has too many holes. Seems like a social project in Political Correctness. ALL Women entering a dangerous region, carrying weapons. And they don't know how to use them. If fact they often choose not to use them. (HINT: When fighting monsters, use the bullets to kill them!) This was such a terrible movie, that if I were not with a couple who invited us to join them, my wife and I would have walked out. I lost all intrest 20 minutes into the movie. It became a very painful experience, and in the end made me question our friends judgement in picking movies. I'll never go to the theatre again! Now I remember, why I stopped going to the theater back in 2016. (I hate the Liberal elites who want to tell the majority of the country we voted for the wrong person, when they can't even make a good movie anymore. They should concentrate on acting, and not politics. They stand a better chance at being successful if they keep perfecting their craft. Because they suck at giving their political opinions to people who could care less about their pathetic, rich, drug fueled, pedo driven lifestyles in a fantasy world, that most intelligent people want nothing to do with.) No thanks. No more of my money goes to HOLLYWOOD movies. I'm opting for the Indie films.","Annihilation",4744,3.8,3.3
"4745",3.5,"  Virtually all who saw the movie left without any clear idea of what the movie was about. That may be the director's aim but it left many thinking they wasted their money.","Annihilation",4745,3.8,0.3
"4746",4,"  Solid Sci-Fi. Should have been handed to you in smaller portions so you could explore on your own a little longer. Not for young children.","Annihilation",4746,3.8,-0.2
"4747",1,"  Extraordinarily boring, zero context and character development...Already sold to Netflix.","Annihilation",4747,3.8,2.8
"4748",3,"  I really enjoyed the movie up until the end. I loved the mysterious scientific journey the movie seemed to take you through, but about 3/4 of the way through that concept was shred to pieces, as the seemingly supernatural took over. I was really hoping for a scientific answer at the end, or at least some sort of resolution, but there wasn't much. As disappointing as the ending was, the movie as a whole was fascinating and there wasn't a dull moment. That being said, I hate movies that leave so many questions unanswered.","Annihilation",4748,3.8,0.8
"4749",2.5,"  Disappointing. No characters that we care about. No plot elements that are interesting. Lots of holes though. I understand that the book series is highly regarded, but after seeing the movie without reading the book, I am mystified why. Most children over the age of ten could have figured out a way of exploring an anomaly better than this movie does. A supposed team of scientists doesn't do anything even remotely resembling the scientific method. Lame.","Annihilation",4749,3.8,1.3
"4750",5,"  Well made, well acted and beautiful overall. This movie is an allegory about life and self-destruction. This is a cult movie , I bet you that you will be thinking about it for a few days...until you figure out the concept of this sci-fi.","Annihilation",4750,3.8,-1.2
"4751",3,"  Annihilation 3/5 StarsThis is a beautiful film that is also a horrifying sci-fi mystery. We follow Lena along as a biology professor who's husband disappears on a secret mission. ..or DOES HE? Lena attempts to unravel the questions pertaining to a strange phenomenon that defies explanation and incurs a government cover-up. Look , i cannot really get into much of this without spoiling it, so i will just say that Natalie Portman is convincing as always but left her charm at the door. This is a broken woman coming to terms with some hard emotions, but also facing the impossible unknown. Oscar Isaacs is passable but the story primarily focuses on 5 women who all really nail their very different and interesting characters. it's great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh getting more  work and Gina Rodriguez and Tesa Thompson bring some energy. The sound design is inconsistent. The big moments, the terrifying, the weird sequences all get some unforgettable audio tracks (if this movie gets any award nods, it will be for sound design) but the slower parts of the film keep going back to this acoustic guitar throw-away filler piece when it isn't silent that is. it's as weird as the rest, i guess. Do you like being creeped out? Do you want some new disturbing images to bounce around in that sick twisted brain of yours? Are unanswered science-defying questions a turn-on? Well then this is the movie for you. Me, i love this stuff, but i cannot give it a higher rating based on what i think is a very niche genre of film that most audiences arent really signed up for. Don't bring the kids unless you want them to start wetting the bed again.","Annihilation",4751,3.8,0.8

"4754",2,"  Visually, this movie was good, but other than Portman's character, there was very little character development, Jennifer Jason Leigh seemed like she was on heavy dosses of valium and reading off a cue card & the story, which had the potential to be really good, wound up leaving me with a lot of questions, and not in a good way - more like questioning all the plot holes.","Annihilation",4754,3.8,1.8
"4755",2.5,"  It had it's high and low moments. A lot of questions in the final scene.","Annihilation",4755,3.8,1.3
"4756",0.5,"  Dumb pointless. Like zero actual science. Just dumb people running around in a cool place doing dumb things.","Annihilation",4756,3.8,3.3
"4757",0.5,"  Plot was minimal at best. Some nice visuals but way too many questions and holes.","Annihilation",4757,3.8,3.3
"4758",5,"  Lots of suspense. Fascinating sci fi plot, highly recommend","Annihilation",4758,3.8,-1.2
"4759",3,"  This movie is pretty to look at, and the score and sound design are very effective. But if you are going to spend money on making a film, you should make sure the story makes some sense. If this an alien invasion? If so, why do the aliens spend 4 years and tons of energy to transform two people? And everything else you've (the aliens) done is easily and instantly dispatched with a single phosphorus grenade? If this just an astronomical/biological/natural accident? Then again why is some much energy expended make stuff look pretty? And why make everything so interconnected and extremely flammable? If this is just some head-trip, then, uh...who cares? It's all in their heads. This appears to be a movie-by-committee. You know: Writer 1 ""Ooh...how about if the antelope have flowers in their antlers?"" Writer 2 ""Or if the bear has an exposed skull and screams like a girl?"" And there was no one there to pull all the lose ends together. Too bad, Garland, because Ex Machina was brilliant.","Annihilation",4759,3.8,0.8
"4760",4.5,"  Awesome screenwriting. Special effects were also great. Directing and acting well above average, but could be better. Overall, I loved this film.","Annihilation",4760,3.8,-0.7
"4761",1.5,"  This had all the makings of a good movie but it fell short. The acting wasn't the issue the plot wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. One of the main issues I had was the fact that they only sent out a small crew to find out what happened to the others so that made for the movie to be very slow and boring what I wished they would have done is put more people on the mission that way they could of had more action maybe have the mutant Gator and bear take out a few more people it would of made the movie a whole lot more interesting beisdes why would they only send five people out to an uncharted area where nobody has come back alive from you think they would have had atleast 10 or 15 more people with them. It also seemed like the movie was filmed with bad lighting it sure seemed dark a gritty inwhich this film should have popped off the screen especially when the went into the area X. My opinion is they wanted to make a good movie but they didn't want to spend the money on good cgi and put more but lesser known cast members in the movie .Should have been a movie but fell flat. Side note they still won't let me type my review for Black Panther. I just want to know why?","Annihilation",4761,3.8,2.3
"4762",4.5,"  Annihilation is not a run-of-the-mill scifi movie and worth the theater ticket price. I loved the strong female characters and the overall creepy/mysterious atmosphere. The scares were much more effective because they were not the conventional scares audiences have grown accustomed to (movies like the Alien franchise). I look forward to what they do with the remaining two books in the Southern Reach Series.","Annihilation",4762,3.8,-0.7
"4763",4,"  I was simply blown away by this uniquely told, thought provoking and visually stunning science-fiction movie. In my opinion, Alex Garland is part of the subgenre that is well-produced, well-acted sci-fi based on mind-bending concepts. Even though I didn't come out of the movie understanding everything, it made me think about the nature of life. And for me that's worth the price...","Annihilation",4763,3.8,-0.2
"4764",2.5,"  2.5/5.0 stars - Grade: C","Annihilation",4764,3.8,1.3
"4765",3.5,"  Visually entertaining and a movie that stimulates the mind. There are several loose ends that could have been filled in better with more time. Should have been longer in my opinion. The science aspect was cool though.","Annihilation",4765,3.8,0.3
"4766",5,"  EXCELLENT. Sad, Haunting, Scary and Beautiful. If you need 'happy little bows' tied in your movies, not for you. But for everyone else, PLEASE go see this.","Annihilation",4766,3.8,-1.2

"4768",5,"  Excellent thriller! Very creative and visually interesting.","Annihilation",4768,3.8,-1.2
"4769",4,"  Sci fi for thinkers who can tolerate - and indeed enjoy - ambiguity, nonlinear chronology, unfamiliar ideas and unresolved questions requires an audience with intelligence, curiosity, patience, and an attention span that exceeds that of mainstream audiences who prefer pretentious Star Wars space opera, hokey Star Trek nostalgia mining or the meaningless, testosterone-fueled adolescent kinetics of the Transformers series. If yet another over-baked CG retelling of the David vs. Goliath myth with robots, ray guns and REALLY BIG EXPLOSIONS!(TM) is your idea of cutting-edge science fiction, steer clear. This is not for you.","Annihilation",4769,3.8,-0.2
"4770",1,"  Annihilation (The movie!) is another one of Hollywood's less interesting attempts to merge today's popular social fiction with science fiction. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny were way short of convincing. I truly wish the ""genetically augmented bear"" made it's debut sooner and more frequent throughout this film, as this computer generated entity was the only thing that was remotely entertaining /convincing and did a great job of removing some of the less convincing characters from the story .. The story line was somewhat thought provoking from a scientific perspective, however, it gave little back in the form of intelligent narrative, so in my mind this story told through the lens of Alex Garland was mostly pathetic and nonsensical. This film was created for gay people and women ... and definitely not for a straight blooded all American/All Canadian man. A very bad .. bad movie! This is a Rotten Tomato","Annihilation",4770,3.8,2.8
"4771",3.5,"  A film whose intrigue and engaging plot suffers from a campy and bizarre 3rd act. While I loved everything up until the final 20-30 minutes of the film, the somewhat pretentious climax could not live up its engaging first 90 minutes. Definitely thought-provoking and worth a second viewing to take in all the elements surrounding the film.","Annihilation",4771,3.8,0.3
"4772",5,"  This might be the best Sci-fi movie in years. On the surface there's plenty of trippy things to look at but this movie also delves deep into existential paradoxes. Mind Blowing.","Annihilation",4772,3.8,-1.2
"4773",4,"  Let's say right off the bat that Annihilation isn't for everyone. If you like sci-fi and I'll say weird sci-fi, then this is a movie for you (as it is for me). The colors, images and set pieces are excellent. All of the female leads do a very good job in telling this story from different perspectives. This story isn't told in a straight linear fashion which certainly can be tricky, but here it is pulled off. Let's say this, if you like Blade Runner 2049, I'd say there's a very good chance you will like this one. If you didn't like that movie, I'd say stay away.","Annihilation",4773,3.8,-0.2
"4774",0.5,"  Very disappointed - left the theater wondering what the point was of making this movie. Maybe I'm too shallow to ponder, but don't care enough to do so.","Annihilation",4774,3.8,3.3
"4775",5,"  Not your typical sci-fi. It was a breath of fresh air in a genre that has far to many clones","Annihilation",4775,3.8,-1.2
"4776",3.5,"  A slow-burning, visually stunning, and terrifying, sci-fi mind warp adapted by ""Ex Machina"" director Alex Garland. Garland weaves his interpretation with intelligent themes that feel slightly too lofty in hindsight.","Annihilation",4776,3.8,0.3
"4777",1.5,"  Very slow moving and never really explains what is going on. The ending is very confusing but they use bright and flashing lights to distract you from plot holes. They expect you to just accept everything that is happening with no explanation as to why it is happening. I would not watch this again or recommend anyone waste their time watching it.","Annihilation",4777,3.8,2.3
"4778",5,"  A rare event these days: a totally satisfying film. It absorbed me completely into its world and left me thinking and wonder-ing about it long afterwards.","Annihilation",4778,3.8,-1.2
"4779",5,"  Simply amazing! Nowadays, most movies don't leave you with anything to think about. They have a conventional ending and everything is by the numbers. I guess this is what the average joe wants? A mindless popcorn flick that you'll forget after watching the next one? This was definitely unique, well acted and visually spectacular. I'm sure if you're not a fan of movies that leave some things unexplained this might not be your type of movie. In a time when Hollywood is churning out unoriginal, emotionless throwaway movies on an assembly line, this is refreshing.","Annihilation",4779,3.8,-1.2
"4780",5,"  Very well done. Suspense-filled from beginning to end. And the last 15 minutes gave you a lot to think about.","Annihilation",4780,3.8,-1.2
"4781",5,"  An amazing visual ride. By far one of the best modern sci-fi movies up to date, it is rather slow and the pacing can come off that way. But its all about emotion, the human condition and how we are affecting the world in an odd twist of fate. We see how humans build and change in the Shimmer. This movie is amazing, highly recommend it.","Annihilation",4781,3.8,-1.2
"4782",5,"  Breathtaking. It captures the atmosphere and aesthetic of the books so well while also being very much it's own thing. ?I loved the books and I loved this movie, but if you have read the books I would recommend not going in expecting it to be a straight page to screen translation. My boyfriend has never read the books, but he also loved it.","Annihilation",4782,3.8,-1.2
"4783",1,"  Natalie Portman cannot carry a film by herself. She just isn't credible.","Annihilation",4783,3.8,2.8
"4784",1,"  I liked the premise of the movie ANNIHILATION. A group of female military scientists enter ""The Shimmer,"" a mysterious quarantined zone that is full of mutating landscapes and creatures, to find why the previous military personnel never returned. Apparently, I wasn't the only one interested as the theater was near capacity (although the 20-screen complex was only offering this on one screen on opening weekend). Slow (and boring) start to the movie, but eventually the movie starts to pickup steam 35-40 minutes in with some exciting/scary/grotesque scenes and then the movie quickly falls flat again, with more boring flashbacks. The ending was anticlimactic which had the capacity audience leaving in silence (as in ""that's it?""). Natalie Portman is a talented actress and her skills were just wasted here. She looked out of place, and not believable as this character.","Annihilation",4784,3.8,2.8

This is one of those ""intelligent"" films that a lot of professional reviewers love to rave about, because it makes them seem smart in the process.I'm not going to waste my breath on details, but I will say this...it may be categorized as Sci-Fi/Horror (and that bear scene in the base was admittedly creepy...the only reason this gets two stars instead of one), but if you're looking for a thrill ride along the lines of the Alien franchise, you're not going to find it here.","Annihilation",4795,3.8,1.8

"4797",2,"  Let's get the good out of the way first. The acting in this movie was pretty exceptional. Tessa, Gina, Natalie, and Isaac all gave incredible performances. Jennifer portrayal of her character didn't really make me understand what she was trying to convey or portray. Now, for the bad. Pretty much everything else. The storyline started nowhere and went nowhere. The whole storyline just made no sense. I still don't know why these alien creatures were on Earth. Were they out to ""annihilate"" Earth's living beings? Were they here to clone them? Were they here to create a whole new type of living creature? Was the mission to create a world like their own, akin to Steppenwolf's mission in Justice League? No idea.","Annihilation",4797,3.8,1.8

"4804",3,"  Way, way too hard to understand the ending. Otherwise a great sci-fi story. Plot well done right up to the last 15 min...then I got totally lost. My wife said it was a bad as Prometheus. I'm not going that far, but wasn't all I had expected. Bummer.","Annihilation",4804,3.8,0.8

"4810",0.5,"  I'm utterly baffled by the high rating this movie is getting. However, kudos to the actors for putting on a good performance despite the low-quality story they had to work with. Every movie requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, but the screenwriter really abused that with glaringly unintelligent actions by characters that were supposed to be intelligent. Examples:In the years that it's been there, no one that has gone in to the shimmer has returned (including highly trained soldiers)? Well then, clearly 4 scientists should be able to do it with no escort.A GIANT mutated alligator attacks and takes a full magazine from an assault rife to kill? Taking boats instead of walking on land sounds like a good idea.They are smart enough to set up camp in the tower, but then set up watch on the ground 50 feet from the tower with a bright light on it? Seriously?There are many, many more examples, but I'll wrap up with this; the story hinted at the possibility of thought provoking ideas, and then failed to deliver...on anything.","Annihilation",4810,3.8,3.3
"4811",4.5,"  Annihilation is the film equivalent of a flavor explosion as the film manages to combine various different genre elements from both science fiction as well as horror and uses it to the benefit of the film's themes to craft a film that's not only every bit as, if not more challenging, as Ex_Machina, but also leaves you wanting more from the Southern Reach trilogy.","Annihilation",4811,3.8,-0.7

"4813",5,"  Very good overall. Visually interesting. Story was good.","Annihilation",4813,3.8,-1.2
"4814",5,"  Felt the need to balance out the mixed reviews on this one. This is an amazing movie but do not go to see it if you don't want to be challenged or don't appreciate brainy or ""artsy"" sci-fi. It may look like an Alien-esque horror film but it's not. Sure there's a few jump scares but the ending is something most people won't like. It's not a movie for the masses. But what there is is brilliant cinematography, fine performances (especially by Natalie Portman) and a concept that will have you thinking for hours after seeing it. I'm not going to give away much more as Thais is a movie to be experienced and thought about on your own (maybe with some help from others afterwards).Just please don't go to see this if you are expecting a popcorn action flick.","Annihilation",4814,3.8,-1.2
"4815",3.5,"  ""Annihilation"" (R, 1:55) sounds like it should be a sci-fi - horror - action movie. As the musical prophet (Meat Loaf) has taught us: two out of three ain't bad. This movie is firmly in the sci-fi / horror camp. There is some action, but the focus is more on the characters - a female cast, atypical for the genre.Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a medical school biology instructor and former U.S. Army soldier, whose active-duty special forces husband (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) goes missing on a top-top secret mission - for a whole year. When Kane suddenly shows up in the hallway outside his old bedroom, he's... not himself. After an emotional embrace, Lena demands answers from the practically catatonic Kane, but he doesn't have many. Then, he experiences a severe medical episode which lands him - and Lena - in a top-top-top secret government facility just outside a gradually expanding land and shoreline area called ""The Shimmer"", hidden behind a colorful curtain of light through which drones, animals and people have been sent, never to be seen or heard from again, well, except for Kane, that is.Rather than sitting on her hands while Kane may be dying in that building, Lena talks the facility's psychologist (Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh), into letting her come on the expedition she's about to lead into the Shimmer, along with three fellow scientists, played by Gina Rodriguez, Josie Radek and Tuva Novotny. Since the male military teams haven't been able to survive the Shimmer, maybe, just maybe, female scientists (or, simply, scientists, as one of them points out to Lena) will be able to have more success. They each have their own reasons for volunteering for what may well turn out to be a suicide mission, and they each have their own struggles surviving an environment in which strange, new plants and animals exist - and rapidly... mutate - as do the bodies and minds of those in this expedition. With ""Annihilation"", ""Ex Machina"" writer/director Alex Garland adapts the novel of the same name (the first in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy) by Jeff VanderMeer and helms the film as well. As in Garland's previous work, the character development is excellent, the acting is great and the optics (the visual effects and the creatures) are stunning. This film is engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking - Alex Garland at his finest. Framing the story in the context of a post-expedition interview does little to enhance the story and it actually reveals more of the story (told in flashbacks) than necessary - and the pace of much of the film is a bit slow - but ""Annihilation"" is solid, inventive and entertaining enough to make up for those minor flaws. ""B+""","Annihilation",4815,3.8,0.3
"4816",4,"  Enjoyed it very much. Very strange and lingers with you afterward.","Annihilation",4816,3.8,-0.2
"4817",5,"  Loved every second of this movie. It was creepy and fascinating. Natalie was her usual pretty good but Jennifer Jason Leigh was better. Actually the whole ensemble rocked it!","Annihilation",4817,3.8,-1.2
"4818",1.5,"  I'm not thinking I should just avoid movies whose title is one word that starts with the letter ""a"" - because this movie ... is literally the second coming of 2016's ""Arrival."" So there are a few things to understand. First; the company that makes the trailer is not associated with the movie production studio. The trailer led me to believe this was an awesome Jurassic World-esque action movie, though Annihilation seems to be intent on being a thought-provoking exploration film. In actuality however, it was a death-paced crawl colored by hollow and worthless tropes of characters and filled with pointless flashbacks about a dead husband that has no bearing to the overall story. The second thing to understand is that just because someone has a great idea, doesn't mean that lone idea is enough to populate a movie. Such is the case with Annihilation. You're watching this thing, falling asleep, actually sleeping, remaining asleep, and then 80% through you're like - oh hey, that's fairly clever. This is what happened with Arrival as well. Having a single good idea does not a movie make. Movies consist of a plethora of good ideas woven together to tell a story. If you only have the punchline of a joke, but not the setup, no one will laugh. Annihilation fails to succeed because while it contains a clever premise, and beautiful visuals, it lacks any sense of pacing, structure, and characters that can drive the film. What results is a film you leave thinking ""Maybe, if i stretch the limits of my imagination, I could conceive a world where this might make a good book"" but as a movie, this didn't work at all. ... IT COULD HAVE WORKED -- but they didn't capitalize on any of the things we wanted to see. This was a really poorly written film with nothing characters and an esoteric ending on the same level of insanity as ""Lucy"". -- ""Oh, that's clever"" doesn't warrant watching an entire 2 hours of nothing happening""","Annihilation",4818,3.8,2.3
"4819",3,"  such an intriguing and promising concept that unfortunately goes nowhere due to increasingly frustrating logic and an unsatisfying resolution. loses its way 40 minutes in and never recovers. still worth seeing for the cool visuals and the could've/should've been amazing factor.","Annihilation",4819,3.8,0.8

"4823",4,"  This film will not be loved by everyone. In fact, most people will not enjoy the movie. This film has stunning camera work and lighting. The sound design is very good, and makes every situation intense, even if it's in a colorful and bright environment. The cast is mostly female, but the director doesn't shove in your face that these are strong, powerful women. This movie will confuse you, and make you think. The person sitting next to you will have another opinion on the story than you. This film will cause debate among the Sci-Fi community, which is great. Overall, if you love Sci-Fi and a complex story, then I highly suggest that you see this film.","Annihilation",4823,3.8,-0.2

"4825",2.5,"  Warning. This is an artsy-artsy, somewhat WTF, sci-fi flic. A slow burn with intermittent action and lots of pondering by a clinically depressed cast. Sad thing is they could have done so much more with this concept and budget and still not be a Michael Bay shoot-em-up CG film. Basically a lot of wasted opportunity on something that had the potential to be a lot more. Of course, to most of the critics who live for this type of stuff, it was brilliant. For those of us who pay money to see it, you're left concluding it would have been better served as a rental in a few months.","Annihilation",4825,3.8,1.3

"4828",4,"  Mesmerizingly encased in an aura of visual splendor & ambitiously ambiguous storytelling, Annihilation is a daunting sci-fi thriller that leaves you scratching the insides of your brain for a good while. This film felt very reminiscent to something like Arrival but with a more sinister twist...think less Close Encounters, more Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Definitely one to revisit.","Annihilation",4828,3.8,-0.2
"4829",4.5,"  4.5/5. One of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Most people will hate it, because it is not an audience-friendly movie. I urge you to watch it for yourself. Maybe you'll love it like I did.","Annihilation",4829,3.8,-0.7
"4830",2.5,"  Intriguing sci-fi concept and theories with stunning visuals and a great performance by Portman, but overshadowed by a severely disjointed plot, slow pace and an unsatisfying ending.","Annihilation",4830,3.8,1.3
"4831",5,"  ""Annihilation"" is a beautiful study of self-destruction and a fantastic, intellectual piece from Alex Garland. Based on Jeff VanderMeer's best-selling Southern Reach Trilogy, Annihilation stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It was written and directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, 28 Days Later).When artists come together to work with big studios, there's often conflict. Big studios like Paramount Pictures aren't around to make amazing films, rather, their main focus is money. That doesn't mean great films can't be made, but they're more interested in appealing to the mass market. When you get an artist like Alex Garland who has a strong vision and a clear voice, it's hard to argue with that result. I'm glad we got to see the film Alex Garland made and not one that was changed to appeal to the mass audiences, because this film was amazing in so many ways. One thing I loved about this film was the general message itself. I won't go deep into it but it's a film about self-destruction and what we do to ourselves as people. We all approach it in different ways and ultimately, we all do it with a new goal in mind. He approaches this theme in a subtle way, one that's much more artistic and visually appealing than most other stories. Because of this, a lot of the general audience won't like this film at all, but those who dig deeper will see everything he's trying to tell us. Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance. Without a doubt, her performance felt so real and unnerving. It was subtle yet emotional, never feeling like she was overplaying her role. She was great as the lead and owned her character. Her, along with the rest of the female cast (and Oscar Isaac) were all wonderful. What I also like about the performances was that this was a movie with primarily women. Yeah, it's cool to see women have ""empowering"" roles, but Alex Garland did it in a more subtle and not so in your face way. As an Asian-American dude, I love seeing diversity win on screen. Garland was able to defy norms in a non-cheesy and respectable way. This film is not only one of the best visual masterpieces I've seen in a while, but the best of the year. The story is told through the visuals. The visuals aren't pretty just to be pretty. There aren't beautiful shots just to have them. They're all there for a purpose. Some of the imagery is so beautiful yet so simultaneously haunting. I literally gasped in awe at some of the things I saw on screen. The images are genuinely just astonishing and there's so much symbolism in the smallest of things. The film is well composed, well lit, and perfect in that sense.In the end, I'd love to talk about specifically what I loved about this film, but that'd be spoiling things. All I can say is watch this film, because it'll certainly be one of the best of the year.","Annihilation",4831,3.8,-1.2
"4832",4.5,"  One of the most focused and ambitious science fiction films in recent years to hit theatres. Thrilling, visually stunning, thought provoking and tightly written. A perfect modern interpretation of the ""quarantine zone"" environmental thriller. Reinvents and transposes the Cold War fallout fear into the modern day seamlessly. Heavily influenced by Stalker, Alien, Predator, Akira, and visually reminiscent of The Thing. A must see for 2018.","Annihilation",4832,3.8,-0.7

"4835",0.5,"  Let me save you two hours. The movie, while having the same title as the book from Van Dermeer, is not based on the book. It may broadly share some similarities with the book - but it got every single thing that made the book distinct and turned it into pure Hollywood sewage. I don't even know where to begin, but I'll just point out the big ones:* No lighthouse keeper - those insane sermons written on the wall of the tower? Gone. Replace them with HR Giger bulls**t, because clearly, that's what Hollywood sheep can compute.* The lighthouse, itself - It's too complicated to have the tunnel/tower separated from the Lighthouse, just smish those two together* The lighthouse, again - Just smash a meteor into it, we don't want to bother explaining the dormant alien in a hundred-year-old reflector* Biologist, Psychologist, Surveyor - Nope. Just call them Becky, Annabelle, Juanita, or whatever disposable vapid name that the screenwriter crapped out. Names were a luxury that Area X didn't afford.* Journals in the Lighthouse - We have cameras! Let's just leave a single SD card behind for no goddamned reason.* Journals in the Lighthouse - part the deux - Everyone was writing journals, that is how the main character is even portraying the first book. If they had even bothered to read through to the second book, they'd still only be getting the story from the clone. Maybe they were going for the Unreliable Narrator trope?* Biologist, part the deux - We can't have some squiggly little researcher, let's make her a PROFESSOR! WHO KNOWS HOW TO ARMY UP SOME ASSAULT RIFLES! No. How about you give a hat tip to the little people that make the machine run?* Hypnosis - HAHAHAHAHA! That is a fancy science word that the normies won't get. Let's just leave that out altogether. (From the back) How do we fit the word Annihilation into it? Just have the psychiatrist, Becky, offhandedly belt that spew out as an afterthought a la Darth Vader shouting ""NNNNNOOOOOOOO!"" because that is super classy.Apparently, white phosphorus make the big bad alien go away. The Southern Reach were slobbering windowlickers who didn't think of just sending in a nuke. Let's end an existential horror genre of 'New Weird' with punching Cthulhu in the dick, crushing a brewski on our skull, and shout 'F**k yeah, America!""Eat a dick, Hollywood. Seriously, just eat a dick.I'm more pissed off with the fact that everyone involved in the making of this film wanted to make a pile of garbage but didn't have the nuts to name it something so they slapped a Coca-cola label on warm diarrhoea to make people think they were getting the real deal.?

"4854",5,"  Coco Montrese, in the challenge we were raised from the dead, but on the runway your Latino blood was muy caliente. You're safe.COCOSeldom does a movie inspire me and propel me to what's best in filmmaking. Coco is one of those rare films you watch that become an instant classic. And yes, the lustful visuals and the upbeat and melodic songs are a great part of the experience but what makes this movie great, is its emotional sincerity, expertly complemented by Giacchino'a score. It's clear that this movie was based around a simple premise and a love for telling stories. And when that happens, everything else is so much easier. What Coco does fantastically and what so many movies fail to do is building a connective tissue that amounts to something greater than the movie itself, as if the fibres collide to do movie magic. When we reach the climax, it feels so earned because it's simple and because it's based on sincerity. Yes, the driving force of Coco comes from the beautifully apparent simplicity in its storytelling. It's a movie that is both a stunning visual spectacle and a touching piece of art. Also, in a time when racial segregation repeats its cycle of power, it's unusually brave to have an American studio make such a radiant homage to that culture, taking the pre-emptive measures for it to be an honour, not a steal. It comes as a surprise to nobody when I say that this film will leave you emotional (granted you belong to the human race). It's uncontrollable, it's within you to be moved when you have accompanied a character and watch the climax unfold and feel like you have earned the right to cry. And normally climaxes are huge and loud but Coco keeps it simple and quiet as moments that really strike a chord often are. What's also not so common is the movie's thematic lines, as you can't help to find incredibly brave that betrayal, murder and death are topics that the movie delves in profusely (yet never tackily). In the year in which Inside Out was release, that was, hands down, my favourite movie of the year. And, damn you Pixar, it will probably be again this year. At the end of the day, you sometimes go to the movies expecting a certain familiarity, something that you can rely on. Coco feels just like coming back to a loving home, it has the sweet scent of your grandmother's cake, it's as cosy as your childhood bedroom and it reminds us of the reason we keep coming back to these movies: to feel the warmth of the purest form of cinema.","Coco",4854,4.1,-0.9

"4875",5,"  Coco Is definitely a must watch, with beautiful visuals, tearjerking moments, especially for musicians. The story is compelling, and you're constantly rooting for the main characters. There is possibly only a couple flaws, 1 being that there are a couple plot holes that don't really make sense and certain points that they didn't get across well. But definitely, a must watch.

"4877",5,"  Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), is a young boy who has a deep passion for music, despite living with a shoe-making family that despises it for causing the husband of their most important ancestor, Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach) to seemingly abandon his family. Miguel shortly discovers that the identity of his great-great grandfather could be the most famous musician in all Mexico, Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) and through a series of events he ends up in the Land of the Dead on the night of Día de Muertos (The Day of the Dead) in which if he doesn't receive a blessing from one of his departed family members, he will end up dead himself. With Imelda and the rest of his departed family not willing to send him back unless he gives up music forever, Miguel is forced to team up with a smooth-talking skeleton named Hector (Gael García Bernal), to see if he can find Ernesto and convince him to send him back home...Although Coco isn't the first mainstream animated film to focus on Mexico's famous holiday where families come together to remember and celebrate the lives of their deceased relatives with that honor going to 2014's underrated gem Book of Life, Lee Unkrich, seven years after his outstanding debut with Toy Story 3, brings both Mexico's traditions and folklore to breathtaking life with one of the most beautiful looking films in Pixar Animation Studio's library.The Land of the Dead, while being a more modernized take on the Mexican afterlife when compared to Book of Life's fairy tale atmosphere, is stunning to look at, with the best examples being the outstanding character animation such as appealing skeletons with eyeballs and the shape-shifting alebrije creatures and the screenplays deep respect for Mexican culture which explains to audiences the importance of Mexican family traditions and the concepts of the most interesting aspects of the holiday such as ofrendas being vital for the deceased to visit the land of the living and the deep importance of being remembered.It's true that this film does contain numerous tropes present in other Pixar films, with the most obvious examples being Ratatouille and Brave, But Coco's beautiful animation, impressive voice-acting that's surprisingly not overtaken by celebrity voices when compared to other mainstream animated films, its deep respect for Mexican culture, outstanding use of music and it's willingness to address death in a positive light like the best of Tim Burton's filmography, makes this, along with 2015's Inside Out, the strongest Pixar film of the 2010's.","Coco",4877,4.1,-0.9
"4878",5,"  Coco is masterfully crafted. With original songs like ""Remember Me"" (Kristen Anderson-Lopez / Robert J. Lopez) featured at several different points thoughout the feature and an original score by Michael Giacchino, both paying tribute to the traditional sound of Mexico; Coco's soundtrack doesn't just accompany the story, it is the story!","Coco",4878,4.1,-0.9
"4879",4,"  Great Writing: 2 StarsA cute movie that tugs on the old heart strings. The writing is very good, not amazing but very good. Dialog is where it lacks a little bit. The flagship song is sang in English during the movies entirety, which is a little disappointing. Great Production: 2 StarsA visually beautiful animation and fun soundtrack. Other then the city of the dead, not much else was visually captivating. As mentioned before the English songs cause it to loose authenticity.","Coco",4879,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"4880",5,"  A top-five film for Pixar, Coco was a film that had a little bit of everything: family, amazing music, beautiful animation, and a story that can only be told by the folks at Disney/Pixar. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried all three times I saw it in theaters.","Coco",4880,4.1,-0.9

"4896",4.5,"  Coco has taken a place in my top three favourite Pixar films and a place in my heart with it's touching story that can bring a tear to your eye. Coco is wonderfully animated with respect to the Mexican tradition. The cast is perfect for every role and the (Spoiler Alert) twist was not seen coming about Miguel's grandfather.","Coco",4896,4.1,-0.4

"4903",4,"  A heartwarming tale about the importance of family, but also following your passion. During his adventure with Hector, Miguel learns it's all about staying true to yourself and not forgetting those you love. The movie took a surprising, dark twist, but I liked that it was unexpected. An inventive and creative story!","Coco",4903,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"4904",4.5,"  Stunningly gorgeous animation, beautiful visuals that leap off the screen, and a deeply affecting narrative about culture, family, life, and death, help make Lee Unkrich's newest film standout as one of Pixar's best efforts in years.","Coco",4904,4.1,-0.4
"4905",3.5,"  Visually beautiful, great portrayal of the monomyth...but very ADD in all of it's twists and turns.","Coco",4905,4.1,0.6
"4906",3,"  I actually did see this movie, and every star I am giving it goes to the design of the world and characters, the music, and the way they portrayed Mexican culture. This movie is lacking in story, in my opinion. Filled with tired cliches that we've seen over and over. You got the family that just doesn't understand, you got the big misunderstanding that leads to disaster between Miguel and Hector, and you got the really nice guy that turns around is suddenly an evil monster. The villain really is my biggest problem with the movie. I wish they would put more effort into these villains. What drove him to such a drastic choice? Why did he feel like he had to do what he did to his friend? Did he have a family he wanted to take care of as well? Make him more human and relatable, please, because he's basically just the prince from Frozen at this point. The family is also terrible aside from Hector, like they are all awful and manipulative people aside from Coco and her father. Just really unlikable people.","Coco",4906,4.1,1.1

"4910",5,"  Coco isn't just a fantastic Pixar movie, but its a movie that's able to tell a story with dead people and make it extremely touching. Coco is a new Pixar Classic. The chemistry with Miguel and Hector is unforgettable, the music by Michael Giacchino is great, the songs are also amazing in this movie. Animation that surpasses any Pixar movie, and emotional scenes that punch you in the gut Hard! Coco is a new masterpiece, don't judge this movie by its Day of the Dead theme, the directors are telling a beautiful story with a Mexican holiday that's so touching. Pixar, you've done it again!!","Coco",4910,4.1,-0.9
"4911",3.5,"  Pretty fun. Catchy tunes. Predictable. But I'm starting to miss a boy and girl love story.","Coco",4911,4.1,0.6
"4912",3,"  Coco has a good story with a twist and a great ending, but it does have its slow scenes and predictable moments.","Coco",4912,4.1,1.1
"4913",5,"  Coco was a AMAZING MOVIE! Made me sad when wanted to, perfect action, and beautiful design","Coco",4913,4.1,-0.9
"4914",5,"  Coco is a richly animated, heartwarming film that explores portrayals of the lands of the living and dead. The narrative follows Miguel, a young boy whose love of music changes his world in life and death. The strong presence of characters such as Hector, a man nearly forgotten in the Land of the Remembered, make the film relatable for all viewers. This is a film for all, young and old, and one sure not to be forgotten.","Coco",4914,4.1,-0.9
"4915",4,"  I am not a Pixar fan. Ever since..I wanna say Cars, maybe...their films are too high concept for my liking, filled with all sorts of baffling internal logic that serves the purpose of the story and whatever heavy handed lesson they are trying to peddle, but completely destroys my suspension of disbelief. Coco, then, is a welcome surprise because it (like all of the Pixars I *do* like) it tells a relatively straightforward story and allows its themes to reveal themselves naturally, in a way that does not feel forced. Inside Out, I'm looking at you. It's also very much a take off of Wizard of Oz, and has the visuals to bolster that lofty comparison.","Coco",4915,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"4916",4.5,"  Coco is one of Disney and Pixar's greatest movies and a significant improvement over some of the mixed films of the past few years. The movie focuses on a young Mexican boy named Miguel who slowly discovers a passion for music, but is not able to pursue this dream due to his family forbidding the practice. They do not tell him why, except for the fact that it is a curse. Miguel eventually gets transported to the afterlife where he visits many of his ancestors and he begins his slow journey towards solving his family mystery and passion for music. The story is well written and executed well in this adventure. The visuals are stunning and Pixar continues to lead the way in regards to animated films. The colours are vibrant and help project the world as magical and breathtaking. The music is also enjoyable with tons of catchy songs throughout. Family serves as the central theme of the film and it delivers important messages on this front. There are some predictable storylines during the latter half of the film, but these can easily be forgiven by the heartfelt messages and vibrant and joyful world being portrayed. Overall, Coco is a very enjoyable film for any movie goer, portraying a fun and engaging world, with important messages and catchy songs.","Coco",4916,4.1,-0.4
"4917",3.5,"  Nothing like a good cry during a kid's cartoon movie.","Coco",4917,4.1,0.6
"4918",5,"  it is the best what i seen in 2018","Coco",4918,4.1,-0.9
"4919",3,"  The obvious FORESHADOWING combined with some obvious cliches make this film Extremely predictable, One of the most absurd examples is when a character confirms being a murderer by making a movie scene out of it: that's so idiotic.There are also several contradictions and events that don't make sense; the guitar is stolen (a second time) and there is no repercussion at all, some of the characters have bipolar moodswings for lack of a better word, which is partially because this film struggles to SEPARATE comedy from drama, and the villain being literally forgotten; how did that happen so easily? (Spoiler Warning) I didn't want to mention the similar Fox film Book of Life: but I actually do because there are too many similarities to ignore. I am aware of the Day-of-the-dead themes, the big issue is the writing is similar; kid wants to break family tradition to be a guitarist, romance built upon music INTERRUPTED by a cheating ASSASSIN who uses poison, the dead family team up to fight the villain, a grandma dies during the film, the popular guy is revealed to be a fraud. these are very specific SIMILARITIES, but at least it's not an obvious cut-and-paste (kimba the white lion).With that said, it's not a bad film and it does indeed have emotional moments and a good ending. I just expected more from a film this over-hyped.but don't expect me to think that Grandma Elena turned over a new leaf somehow: no way she changed and no way am i going to show sympathy to that hag.","Coco",4919,4.1,1.1

"4923",1,"  If this movie's main job was to make you cry, I would have given it a 10/5 stars. But as a movie only, it sucked. And UNFORTUNATELY Pixar must battle of the law of expectation. I was hoping this movie would be as good, as charming, as wonderful as Pixar's earlier stuff. It's just plain not. And even when not comparing this movie to Pixar's earlier work, this movie still wasn't very good. The boy is not charming enough. The laughs aren't funny enough. The story isn't inspiring enough. The plot isn't captivating enough. Kids will of course like this ok. But overall, it's just not worth the reviews it got, plain and simple. Watch at your own risk.","Coco",4923,4.1,3.1

"4930",2,"  Despite being a Book of Life rip-off, theme wise, it does a reasonable job of telling a story. Just don't expect it to be half as light or funny as BoL and you'll be OK.","Coco",4930,4.1,2.1
"4931",5,"  A beautiful, emotional and charming movie which has swiftly become my favourite Pixar movie ever! The songs are fun, the vistas are incredible - this is a new peak of animation, and Lee Unkrich has cemented himself as my favourite animated director with my top two films ever.","Coco",4931,4.1,-0.9
"4932",4,"  Well, Pixar have done it again. Colourful, vibrant and gorgeous animation combined with a touching story (although rather predictable and perhaps a little saccharine, at times) makes this another wonderful edition to the Studio's catalogue of ever-growing hits. It not only handles big topics such as life and death with sensitivity and care, getting its message across in a family-friendly way, but manages to do it whilst also being an entertaining, emotional and culturally sensitive love letter to Mexico and its traditions. It isn't Pixar's best work, but it's pretty great, nonetheless.","Coco",4932,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"4934",5,"  Overall an amazing movie and something I'd never get tired of seeing. I've seen this multiple times already and even from the animation alone, there's always something new to discover during the film. The plot is structured in a way that makes every puzzle piece and point of view fit together almost comically perfect. A movie that allows both kids and adults to cry over. Definitely worth seeing","Coco",4934,4.1,-0.9
"4935",5,"  Lovely scenario and story. Beautiful songs.","Coco",4935,4.1,-0.9
"4936",5,"  I must have seen this movie about twenty times and still cry at the end. A wonderful storyline, amazing voice cast and perfectly touching moments throughout. This is my favourite release in years and I plan on watching it many more times yet! My two year old knows most of the songs and words and has his own guitar which he holds and sings the songs. You have to have a heart of stone to not love this!","Coco",4936,4.1,-0.9
"4937",5,"  Pixar creates yet another masterpiece with this gorgeously animated and touching movie about the importance of family and remembering those who we have lost. The plot is engaging and filled with twists and turns that are perfectly set up. It doesn't matter what age you are or what culture you are from everyone can find something in this oh so human story.

"4944",5,"  I didn't expect much when I watched this movie and there were a lot of twist and turns. It's another fast paced animated film but everything were somehow precise to the point. The story is heavily focused on the importance of family and believing on whatever you want to be. Miguel is one of those kids who still believe in that. It was an enjoyable movie, never the less. The near end of the story was heartbreaking but that's when you realized that family is very important. It's pretty much the message this movie is showing to us. Hopefully this movie is included in the upcoming video game, Kingdom Hearts 3. It seems to be an appropriate setting for the game and i wouldn't be surprised if Sora and Miguel become instant best friends since they are much alike.","Coco",4944,4.1,-0.9
"4945",4,"  colorful visuals, fun story, vibrant music. and a heartwarming message at the end. Much more lighthearted in tone than Corpse Bride. My only gripe would be the forced and unneeded plot twist villain that's been done to death in prior PIXAR films like in Toy Story and UP.","Coco",4945,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"4970",5,"  An absolute STUNNING piece of cinema. Pixar have outdone themselves again with this epic movie. I mean, you can see the cheek hairs on miguel's face for gods sake! Every bit of detail, objects rendered, lighting, music all so lovingly created by these geniuses. Not so much a kids movie but ending will bring you to tears!Bit disappointed pixar didnt have a ""Short"" at the start of this movie like they USUALLY do. Still 100% awesome movie and a must watch before it leaves the cinema!","Coco",4970,4.1,-0.9

"4976",5,"  It's been exactly 2 months since the premiere of COCO in my country, Argentina, and I'm still surprised every time I see it. Let's start talking about the story defining it with a single word: unique. unique with its characters, the relationships between them, the twists that history has that, despite being predictable (except for the unexpected twist of the movie's climax) is still a story that catches you and is one of the most Exciting and sensitive that I have seen in my life. I also love that when you talk about life after death, you never talk about a religion, I still present it as something that we should all do: remember all the people who have made our family and also those who have achieved a positive change in our livesWith respect to animation, there are only two words to describe it: visually beautiful. The characters, the world of the dead, the shadows, the contrasts, the movements, the small details, like the vibration of the strings on Miguel's guitar, are perfectly made without encountering the slightest error. We can also see the many Easter eggs we can see in the movie: the luxo ball, the poster of the incredible, the toy story characters and looking for nemo (which appear as toys and alebrijes), among other things.Finally, I will finish with the music talking about the unique and incomparable Michael Giachino. Achievement mix the Mexican music with the Hollywood production in a spectacular way. Achieve creates a climate both to make us laugh and make us cry. And we were left speechless with the songs of the movie like ""Recuerdame"", ""un loco"", ""juanita"", among others.The truth is that I take my hat off with Pixar because every movie they make makes us surprise. I also applaud them after taking 6 years to make this movie to be a great representation of the Day of the Dead of Mexico and the Mexicans received it in such a good way that it became the highest grossing film in its history. I hope you continue to surprise us and give us those messages so essential in the present in which we live as ""The family is first"" ""follow your dreams"" and ""seize your moment""","Coco",4976,4.1,-0.9
"4977",4.5,"  This was a fun, touching movie with some great story telling - everything you'd expect from Pixar. I was especially impressed with how they used the main song in a variety of different ways.

"4981",4.5,"  Wonderful film with a great story, highly recommend","Coco",4981,4.1,-0.4
"4982",4.5,"  Pixar made it again. I waited for this film since it is another piece of art of pixar work. Also, I, as a Mexican person, thought it would be great to see some of my culture on it. It did not disappoint me. The film itself is great, the way that Pixar tells the story like only they can do it. All the background and the Mexico town is amazing, something you will really see in Mexico cities. I loved the way they portray the whole family concept (like in real life mexican families) and all the little basic details (the streets, the house back yard, the words used, the clothes, persons physical, etc). In other way, I liked how they mixed all this their way. At the beginning it really does not feel like a pixar movie (just because of the movie theme), When Miguel enters the world of the dead, it hits you and really think ""ok, this is some pixar work of art"". This movie will really have to be in your ""crying movies"" list. It makes you remember the importance of the familia. I appreciate how pixar always puts a lot of effort on investigating the main theme of their movies in order to make it 100% credible, and they did it again in Coco. I can not list it as my #1 Pixar movie, since I think they have made real classics, however, this is nothing disappointing and I think that this film has everything (story, music, effort on their characters, good animations and amazing colors, voice acting is great). You can really feel the love put in the movie.","Coco",4982,4.1,-0.4

"4994",5,"  Visually and musically stunning, with great cultural and family values.","Coco",4994,4.1,-0.9
"4995",3,"  Coco is a nice movie, but it feels like Disney trying to do Pixar rather than Pixar being Pixar. It's missing the heart & humor found in early Pixar movies and ends up being fairly bland. Most of the songs are forgettable, as well, which is strange since this movie is all about music and not forgetting things. At least Coco is slightly better than Book of Life.","Coco",4995,4.1,1.1
"4996",5,"  A visually stunning masterpiece!!","Coco",4996,4.1,-0.9
"4997",5,"  To me, the trailer made it feel like a regular animated movie with constant skeleton jokes.

"4999",4,"  a wonderfully charming family movie that will have sentimental folks reaching for the tissue box. as someone who has never really investigated what the DAY OF THE DEAD is about, this is a nice into. this movie evolves digital animation even further (just when you think the genre has reached it's full potential). character movements and facial expression - though cartoon - seem to express a sophisticated level of subtle movements, making COCO both a visual treat to go with the heartwarming story.my money is on COCO landing an OSCAR.","Coco",4999,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5006",5,"  Another excellent movie from Pixar!! It's amazing on how they chose to make a film with some Hispanic culture in it. That's what made this movie unique and so beautiful besides the story being so great. It's always a pleasure to see a Disney movie that's very different from the others. I loved it so freaking much!!!!!!","Coco",5006,4.1,-0.9
"5007",4,"  Visually rich and layered with important themes on life and death as well as an interesting exploration into Mexican culture. It's got its cliche moments but you don't expect Pixar to stray far from those anyways.","Coco",5007,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5012",4.5,"  While I would not call Coco a perfect Pixar movie (that honor goes to The Incredibles) it is beautiful, moving, and almost certain to bring a tear to your eye. The timing is a bit abrupt, the plot is kind of predictable, and I'd say it could have used a lot more fun and adventure, but the vibrant colors and honest love of family are both big wins.","Coco",5012,4.1,-0.4
"5013",5,"  Wow you know what this is a masterpiece of a film period. Coco is one of the most beautiful and truly amazing animated film of all time I mean this was so much better then the book of life. The reason why this film is so good is that it has a very powerful message and that message is never forget about your family because family comes first and I love that message plus the visuals in the film where fantastic and beautiful I was wow with that and it made me cry twice thats how good the film was and freakin love it so. Overall Coco was the most beautiful and truly a masterpiece of a animated film with heart and a really deep and powerful message that everyone will love and as a Latino myself I fucking love it and my family too. Well done Disney and Pixar you guys done it again with your films but this one is your best one yet and you know what you guys nail it big time and this film is a truly a masterpiece I hope this film wins the Oscar because this film deserve it big time. Good job and well done best animated film ever and the best of 2017 last year love sooo much. And always remember your family always.","Coco",5013,4.1,-0.9

"5031",4,"  I'm going to be honest. At first, I was dreading this film. I had seen and greatly enjoyed Book of Life by Jorge Gutierrez previously, and knew his story of pitching his film about Day of the Dead to several studios for 13 years only for them all to reject it or want to drastically change it beyond recognition. They had told him, no one wants to see a film about Mexican culture. Fortunately, not only was his movie given a chance to be made, he had creative control which meant he could be true to his vision and culture. Seeing the similarities between Book of Life and Coco in Coco's first trailer led me to the impression Disney Pixar was trying to ride on the critical and financial success of Book of Life by coming up with their own version. But for the benefit of the doubt, and hearing that Jorge gave this film his blessing, I decided to give Coco a chance. And I am happy I did. What I expected to be mere pandering turned out to be a beautiful story with wonderful music, great (inside) humor, and visual marvels that sincerely pays homage to Mexican culture. And if you have seen Book of Life, yes the similarities are there but Coco does have its own distinct story, and now we have two great animated films around Day of the Dead! Next step, a Latin Superhero or Superheroine!","Coco",5031,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5032",5,"  The best animated film i have seen in the last few years. It was simply amazing. Beautiful story and extremely well done. It deservers an Oscar.","Coco",5032,4.1,-0.9

"5054",5,"  Coco celebrates life by diving into death. It is one of Pixar's most vibrant, melancholic adventure is a refreshing return to form.Coco is the story of a 12-year-old Mexican-American boy, Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), who finds himself in the land of the dead, after breaking a decades-old family rule about playing music. The film riffs heavily on the Mexican festival Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), with its traditionally vibrant imagery of brightly coloured skeletons. In this flamboyant netherworld, our young hero sets out on a journey to expose a secret from his family's past. This, it is heavily hinted, will centre on the famous musician Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who just happens to be Miguel's idol.Although it has a predictable plot elements in a Pixar playbook, the script does manage one genuinely surprising twist in the third act. As the final stretch approaches, there's also the requisite tug at the heartstrings although it's delivered with such devastating delicacy that even steely viewers will find themselves moist-eyed. Coco is a rousing, affecting, fun and much-needed return to form after underwhelming Finding Nemo and Cars sequels and will help to ensure that Pixar's legacy remains intact.","Coco",5054,4.1,-0.9

This was so bad, I wonder if my opinion on Coco was lowered due to the suffering.Coco - its a good story, but something amiss in the beginning. The story blooms & comes together later - but again I feel like it just missed the mark. Yes, tears are shed and there are some amazing well done scenes. I can't even review it further, cause I'm still peeved at the Frozen short.","Coco",5068,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5076",3.5,"  Cute for the kids, funny but forgettable. Coco is a clever made animated feature film. That's what it is. There's a beginning, a middle and an end. The soundtrack is average, not memorable. At some point it feels like the writer was searching too much for where it should be heading to. Topics like life and death run throughout the movie, so I would consider this a 12+ movie and not for all ages. Nice to watch on a Sunday afternoon when you got nothing else to do.@Korben_Dallas on Twitter","Coco",5076,4.1,0.6

"5079",4,"  One of Pixar's better efforts, and while very heavily hyped (as usual), it's not completely overhyped for a change. Perfect it isn't, but it's quite clever and, to my surprise, actually uses the fairly morbid setting to tell a surprisingly dark story in the latter half.","Coco",5079,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5097",3.5,"  There are few animated films that are as visually stunning and impressive, and as emotionally satisfying and affecting as Coco, which is a story that touches on Mexican folklore and its syncretic beliefs - which is very similar to Asian beliefs of ancestral worship such as in Taoism. The most moving part would be when the song ""Remember Me"" is sung - I think there's nary a dry eye in the theatre as we are reminded that what finally matters and remains important is that it's about relationships: about family, friendships.... and forgiveness.","Coco",5097,4.1,0.6

"5103",4,"  This movie has a lot of heart and some insanely emotional scenes. The only thing I don't like about it is it is kind of predictable. I already knew what was happening from 1/3 of the way through and it sort of played out exactly that way. I also think it wasn't as original as some make it out to be. I feel like this theme has been played before and it would be interesting to see a different aspect of Mexican culture. The music is catchy and most people will like it. Overall it is a really heartfelt movie and most people will find something they like about it.","Coco",5103,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5104",5,"  The art direction could have been better to support the incredible pixar polish. However the music, heart, and characters well make up for the lack luster execution of a fantastical setting. You will cry. A lot. And then a week later that song gets stuck in your head and you cry again.","Coco",5104,4.1,-0.9
"5105",4,"  Coco is a very good, but unfortunately disappointing film which is far from Pixar's best works. The standout aspects are its world building which is amazing, its animation which is beautiful and pleasingly colorful and its mythology which has some very interesting concepts very well explored. The film explores death so well, it is sophisticated in that theme and it is particularly effective in the portrayal of Mexican culture and Día de los Muertos. The characterization is good and I particularly loved the second act with the fantasy adventure angle to it. But even though its emotional ending was somewhat earned, it was still too sentimental. The twist is also quite easy to predict. And its major problem is the soundtrack. Remember Me is definitely a good, well utilized song, but the rest of the songs are very weak and never at all comparable to the works of Disney. And when you have a film that is literally about music, you need to have a killer soundtrack which sadly isn't the case with Coco.","Coco",5105,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5130",5,"  TV Picture Mode settings for the Best Movie Ever Made.I just watched the iTunes Digital HD version of Coco thru my AppleTV (4th gen) on a 48"" 1080p Visio TV. I played with the picture settings and got pretty good results, so I want to share them. WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT-- The craftsmanship of the animation in Coco is astonishing. I fell in love with the A++ story, the symbolism, the dialog, the music, the cultural enlightenment (for me, anyway), and topping it off the animation. I am addicted. I saw Coco in the theater 20 times (3 in 3D) and each time I appreciated the workmanship in new ways: the entire topography of both worlds and how they moved in the background; reflections off wood, metal, and glass surfaces; scratches on guitar fingerboards; Miguel's hair; hundreds of different clothing outfits, with remarkably realistic textures; and on and on. I cannot name any movie of any kind that shows more effort in the making, and at the same time is so enjoyable. SO-I was worried that the home video versions would not do justice. But I was able to see most of what I saw at the theater - and I even continued to see even a lot more at home. This might be because my settings are a little bit lighter than the theater, so many background objects and other details were more visible. I am no expert, and I am hoping a few will offer better settings. But if you are not happy with your picture, I offer the following for your consideration. On Visio I had best luck with Picture Mode ""Calibrated"" which was: Backlight 100; Brightness 50; Contrast 80; Color 50; Tint 0; and Sharpness 50. I preferred Auto Brightness = Off.","Coco",5130,4.1,-0.9
"5131",5,"  Return to form for Pixar. After a series of toy selling movies (though I like cars) this movie comes back with a bit of Pixar finesse. When it came out I was thinking how different it will be from Book of life but I was presently surprised. The characters were developed with high degree of artistry and the animation is top of the line (looks too real some times). The bond of family is exemplified by this movie and audience will feel the emotional surges as one progresses through the movie. The songs are nice and ""people"" of land of the dead are endearing. One of those movies which I will rewatch.","Coco",5131,4.1,-0.9
"5132",2,"  It's a Disney / Pixar: obviously is a good movie. But I didn't like it and these are my reasons. 1. ""The book of life"" is still fresh in my mind, so the story feel borrowed (even if it's not). 2. It's not as funny as D/P movies usually are. 3. The music, as well, it's not as good as usual. 4. The most important reason is that I saw the story coming from miles away. I know, it's a movie for kids and families, not an Agatha Christie. So I invite all those kids and families to come here and give a 4 or 5 star reviews. But from my point of view, if I see the plot twist coming from scene 1... then the film is ruined. And doesn't matter if I am watching a psychological thriller or a cartoon. I repeat, is a good movie, but It's not really my fault if D/P set the standard so high with masterpieces like ""Wally"" or ""Zootopia"" or ""UP"" or many more. Now they have to live with it, and so do I.","Coco",5132,4.1,2.1
"5133",4,"  This film has a lot going for it once you start watching it, and then you might realize that it's great! I definitely though that Disney playing the twenty(!) minute Olaf from Frozen short in front of this film did it great disservice. However, I will agree with many others that this is Pixar in a return to form with a grounded, well-developed story, and sympathetic characters. Oh, and it's rather pretty to look at.","Coco",5133,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5134",5,"  Coco is the second best animation movie I've ever seen, losing to Inside Out. Every part of it is creative, refreshing, inovating and clever, the characters voice work couldn't be better as the touching, significant and beautiful songs. It will make you in tears if you are a sensible one. The design was dazzling as the story which portrays perfectly the mexican costums and life.","Coco",5134,4.1,-0.9
"5135",5,"  The Pixar Masterpice","Coco",5135,4.1,-0.9
"5136",4.5,"  In the first few minutes of the movie I became worried, because this plot of ""all music being banned for some overdramatic reason, but the hero wanting to pursue a career/hobby in music anyway"" has been done before, namely in The Little Mermaid 3, and I hated the conflict in that. And I hated it here too.I understand this family's disgust for their great grandfather's decision to leave his family behind to become a musician, but to ban music? What cartoony nonsense is that. Why is everyone obsessed with shoes, when all they need to do is be obsessed with keeping every family member from leaving and starting a future of their own. The struggles the main character has to go through would still be present, but more importantly, the family would have an extreme, but more believable response to their great grandmother's tragedy. But it's not only them I don't understand. I also don't understand is the main character's blind dream to be like said grandfather. Let's ignore the brilliant plot twist at the end, the boy thought this man had abandoned his wife and daughter, yet he's never expressed his disapproval for that. Others in the movie have, but not this child we're supposed to be rooting for. Didn't he think, even once, that it was a little bit sick of this man to leave his wife to take care of their young daughter, for his own selfish goals? How old was this daughter then? 4? Is it impossible for someone to pursue their dreams a few years later, perhaps? And when the main character learns about his grandfather being this rich, famous Mexican superstar, his idol, did he not once ponder why he never sent his struggling wife money?Anyway, despite this movie's cheap set-up and these unanswered questions, it was an entertaining story. Disney is getting an increasing taste for writing plot twists, which I'm fine with, I always like a surprise.I just hope their next movie doesn't have the recycled plot of a worse, less successful movie.","Coco",5136,4.1,-0.4

"5151",3.5,"  This is one of the best films of the year while at the same time being completely forgettable. The music is all cut-off as soon as it starts... so you never hear a song actually completed during the film... so it is not really a musical that it tries to be. The song selections/writing was all poorly done but you will never hear a completed song anyway. The art direction is really well done with the eccentric color and lighting choices that make everything pop-out and look pretty. The story is rushed and constantly on the move but the rushed pacing feels ok unless they are cutting off another song.","Coco",5151,4.1,0.6
"5152",4.5,"  It looks grotesque at first, but there is a lot more to Coco than meets the eye.

"5154",3.5,"  It's nice to see another breathe of fresh air in the world of animated movies rather than the continued sequels that have plagued it for years among some original gems. I thought this was an ingenious concept and is brought to life in stunning visuals with a solid and heart tugging, if not a little predictable, plot.However, this is far from my favourite Pixar. While the idea of the land of the dead is good, I feel that this Pixar entry doesn't quite match up in terms of script. In other entries we are used to having a story that will have clever references that while the adults might get, the kids might miss. A lovely story but not special enough for me and probably a one off watch.","Coco",5154,4.1,0.6

"5179",4,"  Strengths: As always with Pixar films, this was visually stunning. Bright colors and exquisite animation are all over Coco. Where the movie truly excels is in its heart. Very few movies targeted towards kids can get you as emotional as this one did. I teared up twice in the closing moments and am not ashamed to admit that. The voice acting is strong across the board, especially by the newcomer lead, Anthony Gonzalez (Miguel). The heartbreaking work of Gael Garcia Bernal (Hector) is the highlight here. The movie does a masterful job in showcasing the Mexican culture and paying respect to their traditions, without being over the top. It's a tough line to toe. One thing Pixar always masters is how they craft an entire world in places we don't expect. Toys, cars, feelings, animals, and now, the dead. The world of the dead is explained and shown in enough detail that we come to understand it very well.Weaknesses: There's a clearly underdeveloped main villain. It's technically Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), but we're only privy to that information after a large chunk of story. He doesn't get a ton of time to stand out. For a film about music, there's a disappointing lack of it. We only really get two songs and one is honestly kind of bland. A case could be made that some parts won't really work for the young audience it aims for.Overall: Another wonderfully charming outing from Pixar Studios. The thoughtful narrative, combined with the magnificent visuals, make for one of their best works in years. You'll laugh, cry, and find yourself in awe at times.","Coco",5179,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5180",5,"  Exquisite animation celebrates family and culture. Invigorates an unpredictable story that made kids in the cinema dance and punch the air. Sophisticated dialogue provokes reflection and stirs emotions of all present in ways few films manage.","Coco",5180,4.1,-0.9

"5183",5,"  An amazing animation and a master piece. Another emotional and outstanding treat from pixar.","Coco",5183,4.1,-0.9
"5184",5,"  A visually stunning movie containing within it an inspirational and heartwarming story. With characters fully drawn both in animation and real human foibles, the unique story follows a young Mexican boy pursuing his dream to play music in a family that has banned all music. Delving deeply into Mexican cultural history, that is revelatory but not dogmatic, it traces a story that is not predictable and always fascinating. Without any stereotypes of character or traditional Disney story line, it illuminates ideas of death, growing up family and pursuing one's dreams at all costs. Coco does all this masterfully and stunningly in less than two hours. Don't miss it,","Coco",5184,4.1,-0.9
"5185",4,"  Pixar is constantly surprising me. I had no idea how this idea would work, but it was beautifully executed. Got tears at the end. Okay, the main song was played a few too many times, but overall very sweet. Good twists and turns to the story that my kids and I all enjoyed.","Coco",5185,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5190",5,"  From toys to monsters to robots to the voices inside our heads, Pixar has done it all. But with Coco, Pixar gives us a taste of the Mexican culture and the Land of the Dead. Beautifully animated with a story that teaches everyone to follow their dreams, fun characters, both living and dead, and compelling music to tell another amazing story from the Pixar geniuses.","Coco",5190,4.1,-0.9

"5195",0.5,"  To quote Mr Bush - that was some weird shit","Coco",5195,4.1,3.6
"5196",3.5,"  While the movie's visuals are stunning, and rich underlying culture interesting, Coco's storyline is not at par with Pixar standard. Compared with Inside Out for example, the lead character lacks the complexity and inner struggles on the road to find one's true identify.","Coco",5196,4.1,0.6
"5197",5,"  Another work of art from Pixar","Coco",5197,4.1,-0.9
"5198",1.5,"  Yet more emotional gibberish from Pixar! How am I not surprised? Some of us are smart enough to no longer be fooled by this! But in a year of horrible animated films it doesn't really surprise me to once again see everyone acting like this now the single best animated ever! It'll be quickly forgotten as it should by this summer, guaranteed!","Coco",5198,4.1,2.6
"5199",4,"  Deftly emotional and sincere with its story, Coco carves its own edge into Pixar's brilliant track record and stirs up a tale of music, family and purpose all intertwined with the backdrop of the Mexican celebratory day of the dead. Like Monstropolis or Andy's Bedroom before it, the Land of the Dead is both intoxicatingly deep and also viciously energetic. At some points of the film I did feel like it went a little off track and the film also unfortunately suffers from an extremely under-developed main villain and this was an aspect of the film that felt pretty rushed, but apart from that everything else was pretty much perfect. The few songs that are in the film are all extremely memorable and soulful and the voice acting is brilliant, particularly Anthony Gonzales as the protagonist and Gael Garcia Bernal as Hector. There weren't as many ""wink wink nudge nudge"" moments as are usually present in Pixar films, so this may be one for the adults to avoid slightly as there wasn't much comedy present there for more mature audiences, however the emotional punch of an ending was definitely something that all would be able to appreciate.","Coco",5199,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5206",5,"  A wonderful fantastic animation of brilliant colour, song and true heart and soul. I didn't know much about this film before seeing it and was drawn into story and character, richly interwoven with Mexican culture and family history. Exceptional acting from the young star, Anthony Gonzalez, whose singing voice was a delightful surprise. I'm sure this young star will have a brilliant career ahead. I loved the themes in this film that digs deeply into our need for family connection.","Coco",5206,4.1,-0.9

"5222",5,"  I never had my doubts that Disney's next installment would have been a masterpiece! It really is a masterpiece! ""Coco"" managed to tell the most beautiful story, had such a great plot, and created such a wonderful world and managed to haunt me for life. There are little things that are important in life and ""Coco"" is all about those things. It is a family movie, more than other animated movies, and is full of soul. ""Coco"" is an instant classic!","Coco",5222,4.1,-0.9
"5223",5,"  Wonderful family movie with a narrative that is long overdue.","Coco",5223,4.1,-0.9
"5224",5,"  A faultless offering from Pixar. Bright, funny, poignant, action packed and a stunning spectacle. A heart wrenching ending that makes me well up just thinking about it! Absolutely up there with Toy Story, Nemo and Up!","Coco",5224,4.1,-0.9
"5225",2.5,"  I didn't like this movie, I believe that the theme of 'look at life differently' has been done far better in other movies of the past and that the setting wasn't really right to tell the story to its potential.The characters as always with Pixar, are mostly relatable and likeable but I had a hard time liking the main character Miguel as I thought he was a bit selfish and was basically the 'musician who wants to be a star' trope but I liked the side characters 'Philipe and Oscar' because even with limited screen time they still made me chuckle with their introduction to the story. I'll give the movie credit for its wonderful soundtrack and it's solid animation but other than that there is nothing much I can give this movie. I don't know whats next in the pixar line up but I know it will probably be better than Coco.","Coco",5225,4.1,1.6
"5226",5,"  Great family flick along the lines of Tim Burton. Many thanks, lots for everyone.","Coco",5226,4.1,-0.9
"5227",5,"  Coco is one of Pixar's finest. Much like Inside Out, it'll have the adults reaching for the tissues and the kids reaching for the popcorn. It is beautifully animated, spectacularly plotted, and is Pixar's closest film yet to a musical. Pixar seem to take more tears out of me with each instalment and I am totally okay with that.","Coco",5227,4.1,-0.9
"5228",4.5,"  Whilst predictable at times it nether the less tells a heartwarming story with real emotional impact.","Coco",5228,4.1,-0.4
"5229",5,"  I absolutely loved this movie! I can see why it has a high rating on here! There was so much to it that I personally learned, a lot that I related with. Perhaps people found it boring if they were not familiar with Mexican culture, but it is truly accurate of what the culture represents. I could watch it again, and definitely recommend it.","Coco",5229,4.1,-0.9
"5230",5,"  Disney Pixar never disappoints.","Coco",5230,4.1,-0.9
"5231",4.5,"  You can't miss one of the best Pixar flicks of the decade!","Coco",5231,4.1,-0.4
"5232",4.5,"  This movie makes me update the family tree. Rejoin with all the family members. It was an amazing journey.","Coco",5232,4.1,-0.4
"5233",2,"  although well done and pleasant to watch the underlying message of all dead people gather in a place for eternity and keep coming back etc etc is very old fashioned and very religious without any further study on the subject accepting a priori something that is tottaly questionable and it doesnt make sense. the only message i kept is a symnbolic approach of the importance of family togetherness.","Coco",5233,4.1,2.1
"5234",4,"  Pixar explores Mexican culture, investigating the spirituality and mythos of Day of the Dead while digging into a family conflict that's several generations old. It's a visual, audible and emotional delight, enlivened with loud splashes of color and texture, and accompanied by a constantly upbeat musical vitality. There's no escaping the visual fabric of this film, immersive and jaw-dropping, as it constantly one-ups itself right alongside the developing plot. Particularly stunning is our crossing into the land of the dead, a monumental city of stacked shanties that shimmers and glistens and pulses as its residents decorate and celebrate their annual recognition. The story is simple but effective, perhaps a touch on the predictable side... but so are many animated classics, and sometimes there's something to be said for following through on a promise. Coco wears its heart on its sleeve, with a permeating, spirited warmth that's impossible to ignore, while also touching on tricky, lingering feelings of betrayal and repression. Dazzling and optimistic, with a subject that's, surprisingly, never been explored with such playful reverence in a major family film. Good to see the studio has kept tabs on that bottled magic; for a while, I worried they'd misplaced it.","Coco",5234,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5235",5,"  A well-written movie that came with a twist while sticking to Mexican roots!","Coco",5235,4.1,-0.9
"5236",4.5,"  My thoughts after watching this movie!1. I cried, I said to myself in the beginning you won't cry. You nearly never cry watching a movie. As soon as the last act started... Damn you Disney, you made me cry!2. Disney will rule the world. Disney just knows how to make business and good movies. 3. I need to watch it again. So yeah: I loved this movie. I loved the story of this movie. Since I aspire also a career in music, I really felt for Miguel and understood his motivations. And I also have a crazy cute dog by my side. The animation was crazy. It was soo colorfull and deep. It felt real. As if you could touch the screen and be in this world. The only thing for me that didn't made me give 5 Stars, was ironicly the music. It wasn't bad but also not that memorable as well. The only one being Remember Me.","Coco",5236,4.1,-0.4
"5237",5,"  Coco is a very charming animation by Pixar, healthy and entertaining for both young & old. This film will make you laugh and definitely cry but most of all, you will leave with that quivering emotion after it that you have just witnessed something great. :)","Coco",5237,4.1,-0.9
"5238",0.5,"  i got so bored, I fell asleep halfway through","Coco",5238,4.1,3.6
"5239",4.5,"  Another masterpiece from Pixar and Disney. We watched the film at Disneyland Resort, which added to the magic. Visually it was great, and the plot was very touching.","Coco",5239,4.1,-0.4
"5240",5,"  I definitely enjoyed the movie. Definitely gave many emotions towards the audience. Family is definitely a big theme throughout this movie in general and it was an overall good experience and movie.","Coco",5240,4.1,-0.9
"5241",5,"  Coco was an amazing movie, Pixar always knows how to make amazing movies seeing as I've never hated a single one of Pixar's movies (yes that also means Cars 2). When I first heard about the movie it sounded like an interesting idea for a movie, then when the trailers came out I was crazy excited, I kept hearing people compare this movie to 2014's the Book of Life, I have never watched that movie so I wouldn't of understood it exactly apart from both movies being set in Mexico. Then when hearing the news that everyone loved the movie, I was getting even more excited... Until I discovered the movie wasn't coming to the UK until January of 2018 which made me mad! Thankfully I kept away from spoilers until the day I could watch the movie which was on the day of the movie's release in the UK which was the 19th of January of 2018.Now that I've seen Coco, I can finally say, I. Love. COCO!!!!This movie has an amazing story, amazing characters, amazing cast members who do great jobs playing the characters, amazing music, amazing songs like Remember me, Un Poco Loco, and The World Es Mi Familia, I'm not one for musicals but this movie's songs are so good. The animation from Pixar is always top notch seeing as this is Pixar we're talking about, the people who made the first computer animated movie and has had a track record of having amazing animation in their movies. The movie even has really funny jokes that feel right for the scenes that they're in, even the ones they showed in the trailers are still funny.The big question I have is that, is Coco my new favourite Pixar movie? or does that still go to Inside Out, I might have to have a re-watch of both movies for me to make my decision, I don't know.I will admit, I did cry to this movie, I was an emotional mess when seeing this movie. I highly recommend you go and see Coco while you can and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.I give Pixar's Coco a 10 out of 10, amazing movie and I can't wait to see what Pixar has in store for the future.","Coco",5241,4.1,-0.9
"5242",3.5,"  Very good Pixar Disney animated movie. One of the better ones in recent years. Good fun for the entire family.","Coco",5242,4.1,0.6
"5243",2,"  Coco is lovely, both the imagery and the storytelling. But my daughter, age 6 insisted on leaving half-way through. Not being Latina (and me not knowing I needed to prepare her) she was wholly unfamiliar with El Dia de los Muertos and very scared and confused for most of the film. Some day I hope I can convince her to watch the film again and we will have good conversation about the cultural elements, but for now, I simply wish I had been warned. Adults may love it, but young children will need context.","Coco",5243,4.1,2.1

"5246",4,"  A bright and vibrant adventure with superb animation, catchy songs, and colourful companions. The story is good and has strong morals, but the film jumps about tonally and is a bit too formulaic at times. Enjoyable and entertaining enough, but I thought the locations could have been more imaginative and spectacular.","Coco",5246,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5247",5,"  This is easily the animated piece of 2017. On the surface, its visuals- both in its animation and its design- are flawless and awe inspiring, and its music is pleasing to even the most tone deaf of ears. But, the further you dig into the story, the more your heart is gripped by this beautiful tale of family and ancestry. Never before have the dead felt so alive. You follow Coco- voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, in a tremendous film debut- through this beautifully spiritual and traditional piece into a land beyond our plane of existence, and through every twist and turn, you form a bond with the youngest of a shoemaking family and his adorable companion Dante. This is not only the greatest animated piece, but possibly the greatest Pixar piece ever made.","Coco",5247,4.1,-0.9
"5248",2,"  Beautiful animation, beautiful music, but much like Pixar's recent work, flat.","Coco",5248,4.1,2.1
"5249",5,"  Uno de los tratamientos más inteligentes que he visto en cine animado mainstream sobre la muerte, las memorias, la tradición y la cultura. Efectiva como montaña rusa de emociones, astuta al punto de jugar con su propia predictibilidad y momentos sentimentales, hicieron de un no muy fan de la música mexicana apreciar ese mundo visual espectacular. No tienes desperdicios.All time great. Masterpiece.","Coco",5249,4.1,-0.9

"5255",5,"  Thought it was little more than average until about 80% through, then the twist knocked me for six and the remainder was an extremely moving blub fest. I cry very easily in movies about kids, family histories and people coming back from the dead, so I'm a fairly easy target, and yes I know it was 99% manipulation, but hat's off, it was VERY effective. If you're not moved by this then you've truly got a heart of stone.","Coco",5255,4.1,-0.9

"5257",5,"  I thought this movie was really good. It was a little kids and adult movie to see. I really like the characters. They were really good character in this movies. I love all of the scene in this movie. I hope everyone loves this movie as much as I did too.","Coco",5257,4.1,-0.9
"5258",4,"  Very common theme and I don't see where it fits at the Pixar Theory. Great movie and animation. Made me cry","Coco",5258,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5259",5,"  The nitpicky asshats will point out why the movie's called Coco since they did the Legend of Zelda thing where the titular character isn't the protagonist and is instead a kid named Miguel. But that's not the point. I admit the movie gave off a bad first impression not simply because of Pixar's decline in quality in recent years but also because the teaser trailer gave off the impression that it was going to be a Book of Life knockoff. Although in that movie, he doesn't even die until the third act which trailers made the main selling point. However, that has always been Pixar's thing. The trailers make the movie look like your generic animated comedy but are more than that. And Coco is no exception. Once again, Pixar demonstrates how they're still the best in the business when it comes to modern animated movies. They're not terrified of moral guardians, something which even DreamWorks succumbed to after How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite what my opinions have to say about that. The animation is beautifully crafted. The animators once again worked their asses off and it shows. There's always a fine level of detail added. It deals with the themes of death from a child's perspective amazingly well and balances out slapstick antics with skeletons and a fine level of poignancy especially near the end of the movie. The music. Oh, God, the music. It's practically tearjerking. Bring some onions as an excuse for crying. Since most of Pixar's cast and crew was Latino, it showed that this was indeed Pixar's love letter towards Mexican culture, specifically Dia de los Muertos. Nothing feels like it's racist. There's is a predictable plot twist since we're constantly whacked on the head about a certain fact regarding Miguel's family but what movie hasn't done that? I think that was the writer's point. That you shouldn't make blind beliefs based solely off of pictures. Looks can be deceiving. Family comes first, all dreams have their own limitations, we should always consider the consequences of pursuing fame. And also, don't steal on the Day of the Dead if you're Mexican. Much like Inside Out and, to a lesser extent, Finding Dory, Coco shows that Pixar still hasn't lost their touch. Let's hope Incredibles 2 is just as awesome as the first movie. It has the same director though given Tomorrowland's reputation, we might have to be wary when going to see it. Only time will tell.","Coco",5259,4.1,-0.9

"5278",5,"  Inventive, colorful and genuinely moving, Coco adds another chapter to Pixar's rich filmography with a beautiful message about Family, memory and death.","Coco",5278,4.1,-0.9
"5279",2,"  I'm honestly confused that this movie is getting the high marks that it is. I thought this was one of the worst movies Pixar has ever put out. I'm debating writing a big full review of this to explain exactly why, but for now - the music sucks (the songs and Giacchino's score which is one of his absolute worst), all the characters were the comedic relief, the acting was bleh, the story was shallow and formulaic, the jokes were all like Dreamworks level of ""satire,"" and even the character animation felt stock and lazy. I dunno, I didn't find much to like in this movie.","Coco",5279,4.1,2.1
"5280",5,"  y pensar que no soy fan de Disney/Pixar","Coco",5280,4.1,-0.9
"5281",5,"  I what this was an exceptionally bold movie from Pixar and it worked on every level. Incredible emotion and some nice twists which you might miss due to the great story telling.This is one I will enjoy again and again.","Coco",5281,4.1,-0.9
"5282",5,"  It might seem like a daring move to make a 'children's' film about death - but yet again Pixar prove they can make a film about anything and still make it outstanding. With an original, sweet story, gorgeous visuals, wonderful music and genuine Mexican representation, Coco is a beautiful, magical film that can't fail to delight audiences worldwide - an absolute masterpiece. Bring some tissues, but get ready for one of your new favourites.","Coco",5282,4.1,-0.9
"5283",3,"  Not a great movie, too obvious.","Coco",5283,4.1,1.1
"5284",4.5,"  A bright beautiful film that's filled with life, love and family. Truly touching, sweet and fun with some great music and a brilliant tribute to Dia de Muertos.","Coco",5284,4.1,-0.4
"5285",5,"  Beautiful movie, most people in the cinema was craying at the end, especially adults.","Coco",5285,4.1,-0.9
"5286",4,"  Disney has co-opted foreign, i.e. non-Caucasian, cultures for inspiration and materials before and it is a smart and lucrative thing to do especially for the international box office. Coco proves that Pixar can also play that game, but with more sophistication and finesse and thus we have their new animated feature based on the Mexican festival of El Dia de Los Muertos when families remember and pay respects to those who have passed away. Miguel is a young boy with music in his veins who rebels against his family of shoemakers who has banned music because his great-great-grandfather has abandoned them for fame and fortune as a musician. Unlike, say Moana, which can feel generic and plays too safe in its adaptation, Coco is not only more engrossing and thoughtful, it also evokes genuine emotional blubbery from its audience, i.e. me. Only a few songs feature, showing restraints on the filmmakers' part and they are enchanting and narratively relevant. For a film about death and dead people to look realistic yet will not give your average 6-year-olds nightmares, the visuals are imaginatively rendered with colours that explode gloriously on the screen, keeping the mood light and cheerful. The theme that family is important and will support you no matter what, is old-hat but universal enough, and thankfully, the lean and coherent script is entertaining, engaging and gets the story over without too many unnecessary detours, even managing a third act nod to telenovelas that feels right instead of jarring or over-melodramatic. With a refined sense of melancholic joy and well judged sentiments, it reminds me of Up, which just happens to be one of my favourite Pixar films.","Coco",5286,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5287",5,"  okay it made me cry ahh","Coco",5287,4.1,-0.9
"5288",5,"  Wow! This movie was the best of Disney beside ""Toy Story 3"" & ""Up"". It is so sad that I was crying so much at the ending part. Couldn't help it. I loves this movie so much that I watched it 3 times. Watched it 2 times in regular& then decided to watched it 3D before it is gone. But still wanna go & watch it again maybe in a real huge screen if they still have it. I think people would still go watch it if it's out the whole year long. Thanks Disney. Should make a ride out of this movie though.","Coco",5288,4.1,-0.9
"5289",4.5,"  This is about on par for Pixar. It ultimately met my expectations, without really surpassing them. Thing is though, Pixar has set such a high standard for themselves, that just meeting their expectations is a pretty high compliment. Visually, it's incredible. The world of the dead is so detailed and vibrant and just fun to look at. Having a world full of skeleton people could potentially be a little macabre, but there's a fun and beauty to it that never feels creepy. The themes and story are also pretty strong. It's ultimately a movie about family, legacy, and traditions. The spark of the story is a family tradition that may be misguided, but it handles it without ever making the family seem villainous. It's a gorgeous movie with strong themes and a song that will definitely win the Oscar. It's not totally perfect though, there are a couple things that did bother me a little. For one, we once again have a third-act villain reveal, which really bothered me. It works well enough for the story, but it seemed unnecessary for a film that was doing great without one, and without getting into spoilers it's set up some character revelations that feel a little too coincidental. The movies also just not as funny as I would have liked. There's funny moments in it, but nothing that really cracked me up the way Inside Out or Finding Dory did. These are ultimately small issues, but for a studio with a track record like Pixar they do stick out. They hardly ruin the film though. At most, they just left me thinking ""oh, well that's unfortunate."" They keep Coco from hitting the top 5 Pixar movies for me, but it's still one of Pixar's better films. It's gorgeous to look at and emotionally moving, it follows Pixar's trend of stellar films.","Coco",5289,4.1,-0.4
"5290",5,"  This movie is spectacular! It gives history on the Spanish culture and Dia Delos Muertos or Day of the Dead. Coco is the heart warming story of a boy named Miguel and his family. Miguel wants to play music, but his family hates music because his great-great-great grandfather left the family to play his music. Later we find out, Hector, the musician that left his family, was poisoned by his companion, De La Cruz, and unable to return home.","Coco",5290,4.1,-0.9
"5291",5,"  Hello'I just recently watched  this movie and I believe that it is one of the best Pixar movies I have seen in quite a while. I liked the unique storyline and the magnificent artwork.","Coco",5291,4.1,-0.9
"5292",4,"  Not the best that Pixar has offered but definitely a treat for the family ! Beautiful movie, a touching storyline full of music, color and the silly comedy that animated movies tend to offer ????","Coco",5292,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5293",5,"  interesting, made me cry","Coco",5293,4.1,-0.9
"5294",5,"  That this is not the highest grossing film of all time everywhere is an absolute travesty. James Cameron wishes he could be this creative and this good of a storyteller.","Coco",5294,4.1,-0.9
"5295",5,"  Was simply done really well. No flaws in the movie. Great for the family.","Coco",5295,4.1,-0.9
"5296",4,"  Great film about family. Disney should have released this film in October to cash in on Dia De Los Muertos.","Coco",5296,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5297",5,"  One could argue that Pixar have lost their magic in recent years, but Coco is a reclamation of the reputation that they previously held - a beautiful, heartfelt film that will likely make you shed tears.","Coco",5297,4.1,-0.9
"5298",5,"  Since I saw Inside Out and thought it was nothing like the original Pixar films, I thought that Coco would be worse at first. I decided to go and see the film this afternoon, thinking it would be good but not great.I watched it, and I have to admit, I was impressed. Despite a few awkward moments, the story is spectacular, and it goes well with its dazzling animation. Who needs a story of emotions inside your own head when this has got a beautiful story full of (as this site says) culture, family, life, death and MUSIC! I wish I could have made a film like that.It only goes to show that Disney and Pixar had not lost its ability to entertain. I'd see it again if I ever would have the chance and find a way to pay for it myself.","Coco",5298,4.1,-0.9
"5299",4.5,"  Few films have managed to transmit their story as if were already happening as if their characters already existed in this world before the movie began and coco is one of them.The level of detail, the music and beautifully animated, the story is good and very strong for those who feel familiar with it, for others the approach can be repetitive.","Coco",5299,4.1,-0.4
"5300",5,"  This movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. It's rich in detail and very colourful. I didn't know a lot about Mexico yet, so it was interesting. As a guitar player, I like the fact that what you see them play is actually matches what you hear (while in most movies, people who supposedly play the guitar just jerk away at the guitar while the music you hear doesn't match those movements at all). As a guitar player, I LOVED Hector's guitar and I would like to have it!","Coco",5300,4.1,-0.9
"5301",5,"  Visually beautiful and emotionally rich. I cried through many parts of this movie -- thinking of my ill mother, thinking of lost time and secrets. Coco visually captures small town Mexico and the love of family in Mexico. I cannot wait to see it again.","Coco",5301,4.1,-0.9
"5302",4.5,"  funny good story. Oliver loved it.","Coco",5302,4.1,-0.4
"5303",4,"  Great heartfelt movie!Well done Pixar! [8/10]","Coco",5303,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5304",5,"  The best pixar film since Toy Story 3.","Coco",5304,4.1,-0.9
"5305",0.5,"  I simply can't understand the hype for this movie. It is NOT a kids movie. Not meaning there's anything inappropriate in - I mean that it is BORING, especially for kids. Very little singing, no fun, relatable characters. none of the usual disney/pixar charm. Sad to say, we may have been better off seeing Ferdinand.","Coco",5305,4.1,3.6
"5306",5,"  This is pure cinematic gold. One of the best films ever made by Pixar, and one of the year's greatest movies.","Coco",5306,4.1,-0.9
"5307",4.5,"  remember me..CocoLee Unkrich's witty and dramatic world of dead, works on all levels; from music to secrets, from drama to comedy, from kids to adults, Coco delivers the whole package where not only it's characters but range too works in its favor.","Coco",5307,4.1,-0.4
"5308",4.5,"  With stunning animation and a touching, emotional story that respects Mexican culture - Pixar produces another big win with Coco.","Coco",5308,4.1,-0.4
"5309",5,"  I loved watching this film, it was really heartfelt and interesting to watch.","Coco",5309,4.1,-0.9
"5310",5,"  This is definitely one of the best animations as well as movies of all time.","Coco",5310,4.1,-0.9
"5311",5,"  Absolutely fantastic! Probably one of my top 5 fave Pixar movies of all time!!! Hit me right in the feels!","Coco",5311,4.1,-0.9
"5312",2.5,"  Not the best from Pixar but still good enough. Not recommended tokids too young though. The dead all looked the same, not scary but not funny enough too.","Coco",5312,4.1,1.6
"5313",5,NA,"Coco",5313,4.1,-0.9
"5314",2.5,"  This movie is blah. All it is is up and brave put together. Then they put situations or people that most people have in there life and fool u in to thinking that it's a good film. If u like Pixar movies then watch it me there last good movie was walle and it's been going down ever since #moviepass","Coco",5314,4.1,1.6
"5315",5,"  must watch, incredible, brilliant, touching...simply outstanding","Coco",5315,4.1,-0.9
"5316",5,"  I got very into this movie. It was way more emotional than I expected. Bring a tissue. Fantastic movie.","Coco",5316,4.1,-0.9
"5317",5,"  Beautiful movie.. I love it!","Coco",5317,4.1,-0.9
"5318",5,"  At times breathtaking, and heart warming throughout. This has jumped to the upper echelon on Pixar movies for sure. Coco is the best story about the importance of family that I have experienced in a long long time. And I left the theater thinking of ways that I could be a better son, grandson, cousin, etc. I cant think of many things in life, much less movies, that have had that effect on me. There are flaws to find if you look really hard, but it would be the same as scouring a canvas for stray brush strokes. Doing so would make you miss the point. Instant classic movie for sure and an 'A+' from me.","Coco",5318,4.1,-0.9
"5319",5,"  Coco shows how Pixar got into perfection. Full of colors, music and love. Perfection....","Coco",5319,4.1,-0.9
"5320",4.5,"  Come in tanti altri suoi film la Pixar dimostra di poter produrre capolavori sia per grandi che per piccoli. Coco è la giusta proporzione tra intrattenimento visivo per bambini ed emozioni sincere e profonde per un pubblico adulto di tutte le età. Questa volta ci viene proposta una storia in stile messicano che esplora temi molto delicati e difficili da raccontare, riuscendo però a mantenere un alto livello di serietà senza sfociare in risvolti banali e prevedibili come troppo spesso accade.Visivamente il film è incredibile, una vera e propria gioia per gli occhi, pieno di colori e di elementi di una fantasia infinita. E' sotto l'aspetto emotivo che il film colpisce di più, grazie a colpi di scena inaspettati ed un finale veramente toccante che commuove con gran facilità. Insieme ad Up e Toy Story 3, questo è tra gli ultimi migliori film della Pixar.","Coco",5320,4.1,-0.4
"5321",5,"  Wonderful movie for all ages! I love it when an animated movie sheds light on other cultures for kids to become acquainted with allowing for a fun learning experience. The songs are memorable and the plot is heart wrenching with a great twist you only see in the best animated story lines. A+ from me for Coco","Coco",5321,4.1,-0.9
"5322",2.5,"  Spectacularly colourful with a sweet, (albeit predictable) path. Certainly not a misfire from Pixar, but also did not appeal to me personally in the way that many of their other films have.","Coco",5322,4.1,1.6
"5323",5,"  at first I thought I would not like it but after a while I started liking it mor and more","Coco",5323,4.1,-0.9
"5324",5,"  Coco is a unique movie. In which almost everything in the story connects and is interwoven with one another. The biggest thing that stood out for me in this movie are the themes and motifs used in this movie. Every little detail in the beginning of the movie comes back later in the movie as a motif, a variation, or a twist. The roles all the characters play are incredibly interesting. Form protagonist to antagonist, everyone has a purpose in the story, they all have something to learn, and they all have more layers to them then meets the eye. One thing I love is that there is not one antagonist in this movie and the role of the antagonist switch from character to character and motive to motive. Another favorite of mine in the movie is the color. This movie is colorful and beautiful. The details in the animation are incredibly detailed, both in the world and the characters.In conclusion, Coco is a masterpiece. I feel this a movie where if I see it again, I'll catch even more things I didn't pick up on on the first watch. 4.8/5 Stars","Coco",5324,4.1,-0.9
"5325",5,"  It's a good movie.this movie. despite being predictable, it is still good and the experience is unforgettable.to remember.","Coco",5325,4.1,-0.9
"5326",5,"  Original, lovable, and memorable. It's got twists and turns and a brilliant message. The best Pixar film I've seen since Toy Story.","Coco",5326,4.1,-0.9
"5327",5,"  this movie proves that pixar does some pretty remarkable stuff when it comes to making you emotional and at the same time delivering joy, a great original movie with that is a must watch film of 2017","Coco",5327,4.1,-0.9
"5328",5,"  Beautiful movie, it shows a very accurate research about mexican culture. Family, music and dreams are a key component of this movie.","Coco",5328,4.1,-0.9

"5330",5,"  I loved it.it made me cry.Love","Coco",5330,4.1,-0.9
"5331",5,"  For the greater part of the 21st Century, Pixar has consistently delivered some of the most original & heartfelt stories that entire families can enjoy together. ""COCO"" is one of the best films to come from the beloved animation studio, & thoroughly captures all the heart & imagination of its' best pieces, in addition to a refreshing new introduction of solely human characters. Here, the significance of an important national holiday, Dia de los Muertes, is carefully celebrated rather than exploitatively fantasized. The focus here is on the strength of the family and the beauty of remembrance, with the role of fantasy used to connect audiences to their own family legacies. Music plays an integral role, & stunning colorful imagery ties it all together. This is arguably the best film of 2017.","Coco",5331,4.1,-0.9
"5332",5,"  Yes, Pixar's back baby","Coco",5332,4.1,-0.9
"5333",4.5,"  pixar did it again!!with a stunning visual and incredible animation. pixar once again give us a thoughtful film to discuss the true meaning of a family.this nearly perfect film might not be pixar's best work, but it sure did bring pixar back to their level.","Coco",5333,4.1,-0.4
"5334",5,"  Incredibly touching, COCO is one of the best animations ever done!","Coco",5334,4.1,-0.9

"5336",4.5,"  Wow! Pixar made it again. This company is on another level for making animated movies in my opinion. I really enjoyed all the movie and the songs were really awesome. I think this movie has an amazing message and it really manage the death theme really really well. Btw, fan of Pepita here ;)","Coco",5336,4.1,-0.4
"5337",5,"  5 star's all the way. Great animation great story great music. Made a tear come to my eye check it out on big screen before it leaves the theater you will enjoy.","Coco",5337,4.1,-0.9
"5338",3.5,"  Prepare your handkerchiefs! This is surely the sweetest and technologically most advanced cartoon in 10 or 20 years, maybe even of all times. The visuals of huge open scenes are surely unparalleled. This is Mexico pure, with all its heart and craziness! Thumbs up for the director and scriptwriter. And go prepared as I was not the only man trying to wash off those red eyes in the bathroom afterwards. I think it got to everybody inside the theater. 7 1/2 out of 10 points.","Coco",5338,4.1,0.6
"5339",4.5,"  Pixar does it again, Coco is excellent all around! The music, characters, cinematography, and plot were all just excellent. Pixar has really come out with some amazing movies, and Coco is no exception. The trailer did not have me pre ordering tickets to see it, but boy did it delight and surprise me once I made it to the theatre. I was nervous for how Mexico was going to be portrayed, and if this would be a story too violent or grown up for young children but Pixar does a phenomenal job of bringing Mexico's culture to life in such a beautiful way, and tying in multiple themes throughout the movie that even kids can pick up on. Although this won't get the praise that Moana or Zootopia did, this movie was enjoyable from start to finish, and I can't wait to see it again!","Coco",5339,4.1,-0.4
"5340",5,"  Brilliant movie suitable for all ages. Probably my favourite Pixar now","Coco",5340,4.1,-0.9

"5346",5,"  This Movie Is Beautiful and Awesome and Great and Good","Coco",5346,4.1,-0.9
"5347",5,"  Probably the most underrated film of the season. We're so used to Pixar churning out this stuff that it's become normal, and then a terrific film like Coco comes along and it is hardly noticed. A charming story that brings the audience to tears and spontaneous applause. Entertaining, wonderfully animated, genuinely funny and, once again, a great yarn.","Coco",5347,4.1,-0.9

"5351",5,"  Great story, funny and so well made! I went by myself and I am a mature adult. Enjoyed it a lot.","Coco",5351,4.1,-0.9
"5352",5,"  This is quite possibly one of the most gorgeous, touching, well-made films Pixar has ever released, and it is certainly my favorite since Tangled. I was not expecting anything quite so fulsilling when I walked into the theater; I was hoping to relax with a cute movie that maybe I'd watch again someday, if it was on. What I was presented with was something that moved me to tears, not only as a young person but as an aspiring artist. I raved about this movie for days after to anyone that would listen, and it took everything in my power not to spoil everything about it in my excitement. I would absolutely recommend this movie for people of ALL AGES. Young people will love the beautiful visuals, interesting characters, and fun music, whereas older audiences will fall in love with the rich storyline and intricate plot twists. It is so refreshing to see a film that is truly built from pure, raw, unadulterated passion. Even the music has a natural, organic feel, unlike the processed songs we've gotten from Disney in the past. This is a must-see.","Coco",5352,4.1,-0.9
"5353",4.5,"  For a Disney/Pixar film the premise is very dark but dealt with in a range of ways, the underlying story of the family bond, that family love is unconditional and Miguel on his hunt to gain respect from his fore fathers/mothers. Resulting in a great plot twist unravelling murder, deceit and a truly emotional coming together of ""lost"" family that had me in tears. A beautifully crafted Disney Pixar film that deserves to win an Oscar for best animation.","Coco",5353,4.1,-0.4
"5354",4,"  A beautifully made story about transcendence and not renouncing to your dreams","Coco",5354,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5355",5,"  Great movie and fun for everybody in the family. As much as I love Pixar storytelling, from the previews I thought this was just going to be a rip of Book of Life. It definitely was not. The similarities are there in the imagery, but the story itself is very different, more emotional, and simply a different movie.","Coco",5355,4.1,-0.9
"5356",5,"  This movie is hands down the best movie of this year and I dare say the best movie that Disney has ever created. As a non Mexican man I throughly enjoyed the informative aspect of the Day of dead and how it didn't ever feel like they were giving us a a lesson. They did a wonderful job of misdirecting and show us what we wanted to see and not what was really happening. I almost legitimately cried about 5 times.I wish i could give this movie more than 5 stars but sadly I can't. I'm preordering this movie immediately so I can always watch it. #RememberMe","Coco",5356,4.1,-0.9
"5357",4.5,"  Maybe the best Pixar movie, ever.","Coco",5357,4.1,-0.4
"5358",5,"  Excellent movie, great story-line, writing, plotpoints, characters and so much more. Beautifully made and unique. Well done!","Coco",5358,4.1,-0.9
"5359",0.5,"  This just shows societies downfall into darkness and all these reviews that everyone is saying it is great, are clearly attemps to make the movie seem better then it could ever actually be! It was honestly crap and absurdly offensive me and my daughter will not be watching anything from Pixar ever again!","Coco",5359,4.1,3.6
"5360",0.5,"  Rip-off of The Book of Life, which it is not as good as. This, following Disney's attempt to trademark 'day of the dead' a couple years back, which controversy they successfully swept under the rug. Short memories, and copy cat ideas will likely still gain the adoration and $ of the very group they aim to assimilate into their corporate machine. A decent mess, but still a mess all around. But really, Watch the book of life instead.","Coco",5360,4.1,3.6

"5366",4.5,"  Another original story with a great message once again from Pixar, good songs, well worth watching but scary for young children.","Coco",5366,4.1,-0.4

"5370",4,"  coco is another great film to add to the Pixar collection. The animation is stunning as always and it is amazing to see how much animation has changed in the past decade or so. the voice cast is great and are really enthusiastic about their given roles and the musical numbers are awesome, the songs will most likely be stuck in your head for the next week. Coco is a great film and a must see for families and Pixar fans.","Coco",5370,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5371",3.5,"  The colors are stunning, there are a couple truly surprising plot twists, and a potent emotional punch. But I think the mechanics of the story are overly familiar, and the resolution is never truly in any doubt. Coco's a good movie, and a sweet one, but not on the same level as the best Disney or Pixar films.","Coco",5371,4.1,0.6

"5380",4,"  The last time I went to the movie theater for an animated feature it was Finding Dory and before that I don't remember. I can't remember one I enjoyed as much as Coco in a long time, that's for sure. I loved the Mexican story (Disney's first Latino-influenced film right?), clever plot twist, the animation, the characters, basically everything. It brought tears to my eyes more than once, which earns it my 4 star rating. Although It felt slightly too long, I am so glad my friend made me go because I had no intention of seeing this movie!!","Coco",5380,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5381",4,"  A sweet story, if somewhat predictable. I found that I would have liked to see Miguel's interact more with his known family (Imelda, hus aunts and uncles, his living family, ect.) more before he split up from them to go look for Ernesto de la Cruz, but I did enjoy the interactions he did have with them. I think my favorite moment in the entire movie was at the end, when he was with Mama Coco, and I wish his first interaction with her had been more like that. But the visuals were stunning, and while I initially thought the skull designs were odd, they worked perfectly fine. Overall a good movie, and one that children will certainly enjoy.","Coco",5381,4.1,0.0999999999999996

Hehe! .This is their latest film, and I really enjoyed it...It has a wonderful message at the ending that's very heartwarming...I can't say anything else about the plot, just please, if you have a spare time watch this movie with your family.

Neither of us speak Spanish or grew up knowing much about day of the dead and I felt this movie shed light on the beautiful tradition of remembering your ancestors. This movie tugs at your heart strings as we saw throughout the theater.

Finally a simple story with focused characters and no goofy talking animals shoved in or tangental side stories or one off bad guys or manipulative tear jerkers (well ok some of that but at least they laid all of the ground work for it and legitimized it's existence with the plot). Enjoyable movie, catchy music, great colors, skeletons.Biggest complaint is the misuse of Jaime Camil - we all know he shoulda been De La Cruz.","Coco",5398,4.1,0.6

I can honestly say that I came into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about what it was about, and came out of the movie deciding that it was in my top 5 favorite Pixar movies...maybe even my favorite!I was always on the edge of my seat because the plot was just so interesting. The movie really captures Dia de Los Muertos REALLY well with great explanations and visuals and the characters are incredibly relatable. The last 30 minutes of the movie just had me in tears. I truly enjoyed this film.","Coco",5419,4.1,-0.9
"5420",4.5,"  Coco is a kids movie that ACTUALLY has a really good message, and ACTUALLY has a really good story, that'll work really well for people of all ages. It's what Disney's sold themselves as, both genuinely and fraudulently, on so many other movies. Helps that the cast & crew did a fantastic job after the writing too.","Coco",5420,4.1,-0.4

"5423",2,"  As far as Pixar movies go, I thought ti was pretty average. Great ending, but not a whole lot of fun, and the plot itself was a bit of a mess.

"5425",4,"  Is this a remake of Book of Life? It looks and sounds the same, and have the same theme of Mexican legends and a trip to the land of the dead. Its not really a remake, as the basic story is different, but it definitely is a sister movie that build on the success of the previous movie. Its also made by a different studio, but its still relies heavily on the same pallet. What it does better is to anchor it more firmly into Mexican culture and traditions by focusing on the value of family. It highlights and utilizes the good side of Americans duality relationship towards Mexico. It is also an excellent family movie, as it really is a movie about family made for every member of the family.

"5437",5,"  Can I add more stars?! Went to see it twice already. This movie is perfect, and I never use that word lightly. It js a celebration of music, family, childhood and color.

"5444",4.5,"  I hadn't read any reviews going into it, just the high rating on this site, and that one publication picked a key scene near the end as one of its 'moment's of the year' in film. Even with its twists and turns, I could feel we were headed toward something that would bring the waterworks (it is a Pixar movie, so you know the heartstrings will be pulled with all their might). The combination of color, texture, lovingly serving up Mexican culture for everyone to appreciate in a joyful way balanced the at-its-heart heavy nature - its a movie about death. And a wonderful one it is, and I would agree that the moment I mentioned earlier is a powerful moment in this year's cinema (the sniffing and a few stifled sobs were audible in my showing). Pixar is consistent, and they're able to balance more adult and emotional themes than Disney can.","Coco",5444,4.1,-0.4

"5449",4,"  With a emotional story, lovable characters, a surprising depth and a touching message that nobody should ignore, ""Coco"" may not be a Pixar's masterpiece but it ranks among the studio's finest offerings (in my opinion).

While I wouldn't put it amongst the Pixar heavyweights, Coco is still a great animated movie, one with strong characters, colorful visuals, a fantastic soundtrack and an engaging story.

"5464",5,"  Ah... Pixar You've done it again. This magically, magnificent, marvelous and masterfully animated film directed by Toy Story 3's Lee Unkrich is not only an outstanding visually authentic and unique in style, it's also deeply affectionate and endearing when examining it's cultural contextual nature and hugely impactful themes focusing on life, death and the meaning of family relationship's. Not once did I feel this film was going off the rails of it's outstanding plotting, bringing in all the goods a great story needs set within an authentic world full of imaginative ideas and laws, much like it's outstanding musical score and song lyrics being a great sub-text for the film. I adored the film and can't recommend it highly enough to even both children and adults who'll equally cry during the most moving and intimate moments of the film. Overall, laugh, cry, smile and enjoy this outstanding achievement Pixar has created being another one of their greatest ever animated films ever made especially within the ever growing and innovative realm of compute generated 3D animation that shows the world Pixar are still the greatest pioneers of it's medium, both animation and conceptually story-wise beyond any belief.","Coco",5464,4.1,-0.9

"5466",4.5,"  COCO is a wonderful film. Although it is somewhat predictable and has a plot structure similar to previous Pixar films (particularly MONSTERS INC and UP), it is fabulously well animated, realized and acted; Pixar's crown as the top animation studio remains firmly in place; this is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.","Coco",5466,4.1,-0.4

"5468",3,"  I'm not too excited when my sister asked me to watch this movie with her maybe because i was bored with animation movie, just same old story about family with a different background, but i cried nonetheless :D Coco is a good story after all, interesting to know about Mexican culture and their believe. What i learned and what everybody should to from this movie is stop assuming and find the truth. But even when we can't find the truth ourselves it's really the best to listen to what our parents/elders say (not always though but most of the time) because at the end of the day they only want the best for you and won't let you to get hurt (:","Coco",5468,4.1,1.1
"5469",5,"  The most risky movie of Pixar, therefore the most respected. My respects for the creators that were beyond a story, those emotions that we experience in Coco, are the result of impeccable research. Of the best Pixar movies","Coco",5469,4.1,-0.9

"5474",4.5,"  Holy cow, another piece of modern art from Pixar. First of all, this film sounds and looks beautiful. It is a much different movie than Pixar has ever tried to do, even with the amount of creativity that flows from their films. I got to be honest, the trailers didn't wow me, but I usually see Pixar movies in theaters and I am so glad I did this time. The message about family vs fame was amazing, the mariachi-inspired music was catchy and wonderful, and the characters were well-rounded. The action setpieces weren't the best this studio has ever done, but they were plenty entertaining. Just when you think the movie was getting predictable, they throw that twist at you. For those who aren't psychic, you probably won't be able to predict it. Of course with any Pixar film, there are tear-jerking moments. What got me most of all was Hector singing ""Remember Me"" as a lullaby to his daughter. Go see this movie. No review of it will ever do it justice in my eyes. However, prepare for kind of a weak beginning with not the best dialogue and a repetition of the summary. From there, it's an adventurous and emotional ride.","Coco",5474,4.1,-0.4
"5475",5,"  Such a great story - a must see film by entire family as a group. Music is just outstanding, with such a perfect job with the English performance, almost matching the sensational Spanish performace.","Coco",5475,4.1,-0.9

"5478",4.5,"  An interesting dive into Mexico's lore.","Coco",5478,4.1,-0.4
"5479",4.5,"  So each year we receive from Disney's Pixar division a new animated movie. But is this movie ever a masterpiece? I daresay no, because I personally didn't appreciate Moana last year. I saw Coco on 28th December, which is the day Coco was first projected in my country and yes, I can definetly shout ""MASTERPIECE!"" for different reasons: firstly, the places where this movie is set. I mean a small village in Mexico, so it was necessary to represent some traditions, like the Dia de los Muertos. This years Disney has been capable of recreating popular tradition very clearly (by the way, I think Moana has represented Polynesian traditions terribly). After that, I really loved characters' depth. I mean, even if Coco is an animated movie, there are deep and the really good thing is that they change, so the anatgonists have become helpers, the helpers have become antagonists but always it ends up with a happy ending; I'm not always in favour of an happy ending, even if we're talking about an animated movie. I think that kids could be educated with movies and films shouldn't always have an ending like ""oh everyone is cheerful and happy ok go with the credits goodbye"" because in real life there aren't unfortunatelly many happy endings. On the other side, I'm in favour of Disney-ended movies, because Disney has managed to make generations dream so all in all I give Coco four stars and a half, because I think they should have given to the less important characters more depth.","Coco",5479,4.1,-0.4
"5480",5,"  Marvellous movie.... So beautiful","Coco",5480,4.1,-0.9

"5483",3,"  The first third of the movie had me completely captured-- easily 4 to 4.5 stars based on the beginning. The last third caught me surprise. Even though I predicted the ending, I still ended up crying. Everyone was right about that part; it does tug on the heartstrings. It was the middle third that took my rating down. It was very dark, and it dragged and dragged and dragged. Overall a good film-- better if they could have done something about the middle.","Coco",5483,4.1,1.1

"5495",5,"  This movie is astounding! The elaborate visuals and rich cultural themes gives this movie much respect in the animation department as well as complementing the meaning and story of the movie. The story plot of this movie was very well written; it created a sense of pride for the Mexican culture, as well as a story to appeal to anyone of whatever race. The story had many well written turns and changes, and the plot never strayed away to something random. It also had a beautiful moment of emotion, something that was expected for a Disney movie, but never to have imagined it in the way it was betrayed in the movie. The music, like every Pixar animated film, was beautiful and effected viewers emotionally, however, in this movie the music had an importance in the plot as well, which mixed perfectly with the cultural theme as well. I absolutely loved this movie when I watched it in theaters on Thanksgiving Day, the exact day it came out, and the pride of our Mexican heritage and mood that was given to my family and I was the best experience we could ever ask for!","Coco",5495,4.1,-0.9

"5507",3,"  It's hard for me to look at a Pixar movie as just another movie. The computer animation company has built such a remarkable run of quality work that it feels like something more than just a string of hit cartoons. Pixar movies combine heart, humor, pathos and great art unlike any other company on the planet. Toy Story, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, and the like aren't just any other kids movie, they are highly regarded works of art. https://geeks.media/movie-review-coco?_ga=2.261548493.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710","Coco",5507,4.1,1.1

"5517",4.5,"  So I saw Pixar's new movie Coco today, and man, they can still hit home runs when they put their minds to it. This is a really beautiful animated world based on Dia de Los Muertos traditions: just looking at the backgrounds and visual details was wonderful. The story's built off those traditions really well too, focusing on the importance of remembering loved ones, and it's genuinely really affecting and sweet (with some okay twists). The music's the real star though of the show though, it's excellent. The score is at turns lively, sorrowful, longing, and everything in between. The performed songs proper are even better though, with serious personality and again animated fantastically. So yeah, another big score for Pixar. Just a heads up though, a literal 21 minute Frozen Christmas special originally intended for ABC Family plays before the film in theaters; with previews, that means the movie proper doesn't start until FORTY MINUTES after the official showtime. Confused a lot of moms and kids in the theater.","Coco",5517,4.1,-0.4

"5519",4.5,"  Beautifully done. Catchy songs, lovable characters, and interesting storyline - though I did guess the ""twist"" early on, I don't feel it was overly telegraphed. The character design is spot on, you can see actual real types of face shapes in the designs instead of just the classic CG ovals and circles approach to designing faces - which was a breath of fresh air in the current wave of generic CG character designs.","Coco",5519,4.1,-0.4
"5520",5,"  While a lot of animated movies attempt to play on emotions, there are barely any that leave a memorable mark.Coco has perfectly timed humour that appeals to all age groups, the story is well written and the twists, somewhere in the middle of unpredictable and predicatable enough to keep the audience interested in the movie for its events as well.The film is hugely appealing when it comes to looks as it has many moments that you gawking at the screen.All in all it is a great movie with great music that deserves its 5 stars.","Coco",5520,4.1,-0.9

"5532",4.5,"  **Spoiler warning: contains hints at plot structure and character motivation**Coco is a loving tribute to Mexican culture and Dia De Los Muertos, with phenomenal voice acting (newcomer Anthony Gonzales is phenomenal as Miguel), a strikingly beautiful and imaginative animated world, and memorable music. Coco takes on the challenging task of combining some of Pixar's most successful themes: the unbreakable bond of family (Incredibles), pursuing one's passion (Ratatouille), the folly of the one-minded leader/mentor (through mid-movie villain reveals in Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Up, WALL-E, Monster's Inc... wow, they really like that one), and coming to terms with loss and memory (Up); Director Lee Unkrich weaves these topics expertly together around the the new theme of the power of music to build Coco a special place in the Pixar cannon. Coco also lives up to Pixar's reputation for tugging on heartstrings, developing relationships and ideas throughout the movie to an impacting and universally relatable payoff that gives meaning to the film's title. The premise of the child's dream restrained by disapproving family is well trodden, the villain reveal is a bit contrived (first revealed then unraveled twice by a metaphorical football spiking on national TV), and the ending following the emotional climax quickly glosses over some of the secondary conflicts for the feel good ending (like Inside Out); however, these small nitpicks are easy to look past for the music, the visuals, the message and the overall warmth of Coco. Most of all, I love that this movie will inspire a generation with the love of music, much like Ratatouille sparked my love of cooking and critique; we can't all be mariachi, but the world could always do with a few more songs.","Coco",5532,4.1,-0.4
"5533",5,"  Fantastic movie. Easy and touch","Coco",5533,4.1,-0.9
"5534",5,"  Absolute joy for children and adults of any cultures.Having not seen any Pixar movies since Brave came out, I wasn't sure where to set my expectations for this movie, so I was very surprised at how much I loved it.One of my main concerns going into it was that I would either find the movie unrelatable or that it would serve the foreign culture in a social justice warrior manner. I was wrong. Very wrong. The movie is a natural insight into the Mexican culture (specifically the Day of the Dead) that is both engaging, interesting and inclusive. It doesn't feel like it's just Hollywood pandering to an audience, it doesn't abuse stereotypes of what the executives think people might like or want to see and most importantly they didn't whitewash the cast.The premise alone is extremely unique and engaging, throughout the whole movie it kept me guessing what would happen next. It's fast-paced, colourful, the characters are very well thought through. I was most amazed at the quality of the animation, it's absolutely mind-boggling, every little tiny detail that you would never even notice is there. It all really feels like a work of art that celebrates the Mexican culture. I also really enjoyed the fact that it had a fresh story structure where the world isn't ending and the hero doesn't have to defeat the ultimate evil but rather focuses on human issues and values.In fact, it's one of those rare movies that had me bawling my eyes out at the theatre.Anyways, I wanted to keep this review short and not go into deep details because it's worth experiencing.Coco is fun, emotional and fresh! If you like quality animation and feel good stories, you must go see it!P/SThere are even some fun easter eggs that you might miss in a blink of an eye.","Coco",5534,4.1,-0.9

"5550",3.5,"  As visually striking and fun as this movie was to watch, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wasn't able to enjoy this film as much as I was anticipating. Despite the amazing effort put into the animation, backgrounds, and the designs, the story, while still being cute enough and intriguing enough to keep me watching, fell a little bit flat for me, even despite me not guessing the twist. By child movie standards, this is a great film, although this is a Pixar film, and something about this movie didn't give me close to the same feeling that I experienced when watching Up, Monsters Inc, or a few of the other classic Pixar films that they've put out in the past. Not to say that this wasn't a enjoyable experience whatsoever- I am glad that I spent money to go see this in theaters. One of the more original Pixar movies to come out in a while- especially since The Good Dinosaur was so boring and predictable, and Pixar seems to be leaning pretty heavily on cash grab sequels to old successful films. There was clearly a lot of effort put into this film, it just didn't give me the sentimental, bittersweet feeling that I'm usually left sitting with after a Pixar movie.","Coco",5550,4.1,0.6

Great twists that are hinted in the film from like the first scene, and the villain is a shock. #1 animated film of the year! I can guarantee it will get an oscar. However, it is a good thing Disney removed the short. I watched it, and it is bad enough to have a 20 minute short, and worse when the short IS BAD.","Coco",5575,4.1,-0.9
"5576",4,"  Pixar, for the most part, has a reputation for producing some of the most high-quality and memorable Disney films of all time. They've put out classics like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Monsters Inc., and they rarely miss the mark when it comes to their feature films (excluding Cars 2 and Cars 3). Coco is the latest attempt from Pixar at creating another animated classic, and while it may not quite reach the level of many of its predecessors, it provides a fun and colorful family-friendly experience.The first good thing I can talk about regarding Coco is its animation. Pixar has always demonstrated a profound understanding of animation and they have always utilized the most modern computer technology to make their films look beautiful. Coco is no exception to this trend. In fact, this is one of the most beautifully animated films I have ever seen. The film is primarily set in two worlds: the real-world setting of Mexico and the fictional setting of the Land of the Dead. Both of these locations are equally vibrant in their portrayal, with the former utilizing lots of warm colors and the latter featuring a plethora of bright neon colors and a variety of blues and purples. It is a visual treat that entertains even during the film's slower moments. There are many shots that I can vividly remember due to their spectacular detail and their incredibly varied color palette, so I applaud the animators for their work on the film.Coco's astounding animation is accompanied by a heartwarming story about heavy themes like death, the meaning of family, and the effects of fame and glory. It tells the story of Miguel, a young boy living in Mexico who is a member of a family of shoemakers. Miguel loves to play the guitar and is obsessed with his idol: the great Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician and movie star. However, due to events that transpired in his family's past, music is banned in the household, which forces Miguel to keep his passion a secret. Once his family discovers this, he runs away and accidentally transports himself to the Land of the Dead during the annual Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) celebration, where he meets his deceased family members and embarks on an adventure in the colorful world. The story is entertaining and the themes it explores are fresh and interesting, especially for a Pixar film. However, this brings me to my one criticism of the film: the plot and many of its elements feel very derivative. Its basic structure - the protagonist must achieve a simple goal, but that goal is blocked by unforeseen obstacles and circumstances that lead the protagonist to meet a variety of supporting characters that can help him - gives off a very ""been there done that"" feel. Still, the climax and emotional conclusion allow Coco to transcend its many clichés, making it a satisfying film in the end.With Coco, Pixar reminds us that it can still make the best animated films in the industry. With Incredibles 2 on the horizon, this is especially reassuring, because I will be VERY upset if that film is a misfire. Coco is a fun, colorful, well-assembled film that is able to delight and spark an emotional response, even if it is not entirely original. With entertaining characters and themes that can resonate with all audiences, it makes for a great family film that is a must-see this holiday season. Coco gets 4 out of 5 stars.","Coco",5576,4.1,0.0999999999999996

It's just that the film was a little too dark for most little kids, with Ernesto de la Cruz poisoning someone and everything. Other than that, great job, Pixar!

"5588",3,"  Coco is a beautiful film and easily the most colorful film Pixar has ever done. When it comes to a Pixar film I tend to judge it on a different scale then a typical 3D Animated film, like a Hotel Transylvania, because they have created movies that have transcended age and genre. Coco is a mid-level Pixar film, not quite up to the level of Inside-Out or Finding Nemo but definitely above Cars 2, Brave & Good Dinosaur. The film deals with the dangers of following your dreams blindly and how easily we can pass down hatred through generations of family. The film misses being classic in the supporting characters didn't make the same impression like a Bing Bong or even a Hank.See it or Skip ItThis film is so beautiful that it's worth seeing it in theaters based on that alone.","Coco",5588,4.1,1.1
"5589",5,"  Interesting character and exciting story. One of best Pixar flims.","Coco",5589,4.1,-0.9
"5590",3,"  Coco fulfills the Disney lover's needs, however, falls short of competing with the classics. The visual intricacy matched with the skeletal theme provides an interesting viewing exsperince yet lacks in memorable or impactful musical numbers which has religiously been Disney's bread and butter. The story and morals of the film are clear and easily enjoyed by the whole family while also diving into a culture rich theme, but ultimately this Disney film fills the roster more then the memory book. *** I'm a pretty big Disney fan, but this was the first Disney movie I noticed myself drifting off to. Outside of it's theme Coco just seemed to lack the heartwarming magic of so many beloved classics and characters. Disney has always featured young defiant protagonists, but Miguel seemed uninteresting and forgettable.","Coco",5590,4.1,1.1
"5591",5,"  Just an amazingly beautiful work from start to finish. There is not a quibble to be found unless it's the amazing amount of stimulation but one can focus on so many things both visually and cognitively it really doesn't matter...

The animation was visually stunning, the music was glorious, and the twist in the climax was shocking and really blew my mind! Also, the movie was really heartfelt and emotional. In fact: it was so emotional that my older sister actually went in tears in the last 20 minutes. Overall, even though there were some things in the movie that were a little bit too similar to Book of Life, it was still amazing! 9.5/10.","Coco",5595,4.1,-0.4

"5603",4,"  Wonderful from start to finish; the art work and music was enchanting. Worried that it would not hold the younger kids I took to it like a story with more action or familiarity but they were enthralled. This is everything that an animated movie should be. The art work was fresh and invoked so much emotion and gave a real visceral feel to the whole experience. The music flowed and felt so right in each and every moment of the movie. The voice work was exceptional, especially Gael Garcia Bernal and Alanna Ubach, but there really was no weak link in the voice cast. This is one that can be enjoyed more each time you see it; and each time you will find something new. Loved It.","Coco",5603,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5604",4.5,"  This movie was beautifully made and enjoyable for the whole family. You can tell they tried to give you an authentic feel of Mexico while watching it. The animation has beautiful visuals that are colorful and mesmerizing. The detail is mind-blowing, especially when you find out there are about 7 million lights they added to the Land of the Dead. The only issue I had with this movie was a 21 minute Frozen short (Olaf's Frozen Adventure) you needed to watch before getting to see Coco. That short (not sure how you can call 21 minutes of torture short) was just painful to watch, but Disney has since fixed that and removed the Frozen short.","Coco",5604,4.1,-0.4

"5611",4.5,"  Coco, BEST ANIMATED MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! Where to even begin with this one! The visuals, absolutely stunning, the story is just great. It reminds me so much of Ratatouille's story in many ways. Also, Coco is entertaining from start to finish. It's funny, it's engaging, it's full of meat on it's bones, and most importantly, it's super touching. Now, going in, I heard people say that it is at least guaranteed to make you cry, and you know what, they were absolutely right. Judging by how one, it's Pixar, and two, it was directed by Lee Unkrich, the same guy who directed Toy Story 3, it makes sense. But DAMN, was I expecting it to be as sad as something like Up or Inside Out? Hell no, and that was the biggest takeaway for me. Other Pixar movies like Wall-E, Up, Toy Story 3, and Inside Out may have had me tear up, but Coco went above and beyond with that. It had me not only tear up, but kind of cry even, and that says something. Like with other Pixar movies, you really care and connect with the characters, which adds to how touching and thought provoking these movies are. Coco is indeed one of those movies. It is definitely part of my top ten Pixar movies, and is something nobody should miss out on. If you think it's a ripoff of The Book of Life, RECONSIDER! It may look like it, but trust me, when you watch it, it's nothing like The Book of Life. I personally like Coco more than The Book of Life, and by far too. The Book of Life was great and all, but nothing compared to Coco. This movie truly is a love letter to Mexico, and does everything The Book of Life did, but on a larger scale. 9.5 out of 10, it is fantastic, and if you thought Cars 3 left a sour taste in your mouth like me, do not worry because Pixar completely made up for It with Coco. It is a MUST SEE!!","Coco",5611,4.1,-0.4

The level of research of the writers of the script is gigantic, they actually caught Mexico's essence.

"5639",5,"  More Than Just a Passion At present, the Mexican population is one of the most judged by the Americans. There are inhumane plans to prevent their passage in the territory of the United States as it is to build a famous border wall and among many other things. Therefore, having a large American company import a film of protagonists and Mexican history can have a great impact on American society. These companies are Disney and Pixar that have marked the lives of many children and young people for several years. Accompanying this, the purpose of children's films, in addition to entertaining children, is to promote values and carry a deep and real message that maybe the child does not understand at the moment but that parent or manager who accompanies him to watch the movies understands it and in some way, it moves him. Therefore, most of the time the movies educates both; the infant and adult. Mentioning that, I can say I liked the film because, besides being created by an American company that accepts these people, the American population has the opportunity to learn more about the Mexican culture an realize that we all go through similar adversities... we are all humans.The titled movie ""Coco"" reports the story of a Mexican child who wanted to be a musician, but because of family tradition it was prohibited to be a musician. Therefore, the child decides to play his guitar in a talent contest undercover of its relatives to demonstrate to the world the great musician he was. For his luck, the day of the contest was the same day of the Day of the Dead and he had to spend the whole day along with his family to celebrate it. While they all were in the cemetery remembering their family, the child decides to escape to find an instrument to play in the contest so he decides to steal a guitar from one of the biggest musicians and most successful one of the Mexican history who had already died. At the moment of stealing it from him, he appears in the world of the dead persons and he can only escape with the blessing of a relative and accepting the requisites that the relative proposes to him. After accepting, it begins the passage of the boy to look for a relative who offers him its blessing along with the permission of being able to become a musician.The story of the same one is a quite structured one although it is not one that is organized in a chronological order. It starts by reporting the past of the family and why they decide to hate any one that was a musician. It continues with the present of the child and its passage of going so far as to turn in musician and inside its passage there appear many flashbacks that fit with the reasons of hate towards the musicians from his family. The characters did not turn aside of its role and with this I refer to that it is possible to identify that it is a person of Mexican culture. For example, there are movies that the original role of the protagonist it supposes to be Latin, Korean, Japanese, European, etc. ... depending on the story, and the producers usually choose persons who do not qualify with the role of the protagonist and somehow part of the plot gets lost because it does not fit with the person. The viewer already has an idea of how it is supposed to be the protagonist and ends up being completely different from the one whom you were imagining to be the ideal. But in this case the protagonist sticks to its role.The composition of the music for the movie was an exquisite one that made you want to sing mariachi music until you lost your voice. With the music the viewer could feel so many emotions by the passion the protagonist was dedicating to each song. Although it is a cartoon movie, the viewer feels, cries, laughs and gets angry because behind every character there is a real story. Also, all the songs that were listened in the movie were mariachi songs, typical genre of Mexico, and each one was keeping a message that was going as regards to the story of the movie, from the freedom up to the memory.On the other hand, the scenery was fascinating because you could appreciate every detail for more minimal that it was. For example, the scenery of the World of the Dead persons was one that was consisting of 20 scenes that were creating only one image making the background one full of specific details to achieve a general image. The animation and texture of the background was excellent, whenever a character was moving from one place to another it was as if it really was leaving a mark in the space that he was treading. For example, the details in the character, both the hair and the clothes, seemed to be real.It is a movie that I fully recommend because it is full of surprises. When you were thinking that it already had the concluded movie, it surprised you with other things different from those that you had already raised. For this reason, the movie does not bore the viewer because every time something happened you will want to know what would actually happen or what that situation will become. I recommend, if you understand the Spanish language, to see it in Spanish because it makes you feel familiarly with the Mexicans. Since it is known, the Spanish language is the one that prevails in Mexico and to listen to mariachi music in English, for me, it would be quite strange and this Mexican flavor would get lost. Nevertheless, if you do not understand Spanish I suppose that the message will be delivered no matter what. Also, I recommend you to be prepared with towels to see the movie because you will cry from beginning to end.","Coco",5639,4.1,-0.9

"5653",4,"  Ah, Pixar... you certainly have a formula, but damned if that formula doesn't work every time. This movie is their latest installment, and it's so refreshing to see them put out a film that so fully embraces a different culture. This movie actually practices what Hollywood has been preaching for a long time, and celebrates diversity on multiple levels. The story follows a Mexican boy, Miguel, and his very Mexican family and ancestry. Every single character in the movie is a brown person (or used to be, before they got dead), and it's about damn time. That alone makes it deserving of high marks, but this is Pixar, so you know there is also going to be an engaging story (check) with a poignant lesson at the end (check), and probably some laughs and tears (check and check) along the way. The plot follows little Miguel as he yearns to be a musician despite his family's vehement opposition to anything related to music. His journey takes him over to the other side where he meets his ancestors, because reasons (the film doesn't even try to explain it). The story has its ups and downs... it doesn't always make sense and takes a while to get going, but it pays off at the end, when it becomes clear why the movie has the title it does. And the animation! It's incredibly vibrant and lavish, every scene just pops... it adds so much fun and exuberance to the ""underworld"", I wondered why Miguel was even trying to get back to the land of the living. This film is not as funny as I've grown to expect from Pixar, but on the flip side, it delivers big time on the sentiment. This movie features one of the purest and sweetest scenes that I have seen in ages, and it packs a wallop of an emotional punch. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. This isn't Pixar's finest, but a great family film with a powerful message about the importance of family and tradition.","Coco",5653,4.1,0.0999999999999996

There are countless scenes where I could barely handle all the beauty and details. And the music is so rich and brings in a lot of Mexican culture.

"5667",5,"  When Disney/Pixar first announced Coco I was sceptical as it sounded an awful lot like The Book of Life, which is a hugely underrated animated movie everyone should watch. Pixar has a great track record, with very few missteps. I'm looking at you Cars 2 & 3! No, I won't include The Good Dinosaur because there is a good movie in there if you give it a chance. So could Coco be too much for Pixar? When it comes to respectfully handling other cultures, Hollywood is, well it's a bit shit! I had faith, however, because Pixar has a habit of meticulous research and detail, so if anyone could do right by the Mexican culture and make an engaging, smart, thoughtful, funny, heartwarming animated adventure they could. While this is not a musical, the music plays a massive role in Coco. I was mesmerized by Coco from start to finish. The visuals, the voices, the music, oh the music, and while the story hung by a thread at times it mattered not. Sure The Book of Life had a similar journey through the land of the dead, but that is where the similarities end. Why can't we have two movies based on the same aspects of Mexican culture? If this is what we get out of it, the more the merrier!The themes of love and loss, family and friendships, and what makes us who we are certainly struck a chord (pun unintended) with me. And that showed in the way my damn eyes started leaking!! Coco is a movie that made me feel full after leaving the theatre. Full of joy, love, and sweets and a large overpriced Icee beverage! It is easily the best-animated movie of the year and may even be one of Pixar's best! Yes, I said it, it is that good! I have to rethink my top 10, maybe even my top 5 Pixar flicks!","Coco",5667,4.1,-0.9

"5669",5,"  If you are a person with a song in your heart this is your movie. The family and the meaning in this movie is all. I cry like a little kid and I love each second of this. With an idea in my mind, I have been blowing away when I finish the movie! This is a movie to watch at any time","Coco",5669,4.1,-0.9
"5670",2,"  Bland, trite, and overly reliant on coincidence, this story does nothing offensive, but it has nothing except for its bright aesthetic to distinguish it from any other generic 'journey of discovery' style family movie.","Coco",5670,4.1,2.1

"5675",5,"  The story - the voice acting - the beauty of the entire movie. Everything was great. A must add to any animated collection!","Coco",5675,4.1,-0.9
"5676",4,"  Pixar story about a young boy who wants nothing more than to be a musician, except that his shoemaker family has forbidden music due to the boy's great great grandfather abandoning the family long ago to pursue a life as a musician (Coco is the boy's very elderly great grandmother, and daughter of the shunned musician). The film takes place during Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where families remember and celebrate their deceased relatives, and when the film's hero, Miguel, discovers his runaway relative is actually the famous star of music and film, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice by Benjamin Bratt), he sets out to seize his moment by entering a music contest, only to find himself transported to the colorful and vibrant land of the dead. There he find a world populated by skeletal deceased relatives waiting to be remembered by their families so they can return to the world of the living to once again be with their descendants and loved ones. Miguel must find a way back to the world of the living before the end of the night, but that's not as easy as he expects when he discovers his relatives in the land of the dead also continue to hold music in contempt and refuse to help unless he renounces music. But wait! Ernesto de la Cruz is a relative and a musician, but he's just as famous in death as he was in life, so for Miguel to get to de la Cruz is no easy task. Miguel is aided on his quest by Héctor, a down-on-his-luck character who claims to know de la Cruz, but who is beginning to fade away from this world because his family no longer remembers him. Without spoiling any plot points, it's the themes of family and being remembered by your children and descendants that tugs at the heart strings and is at the core of the film. Pixar does sentiment better than anyone (I still get weepy just thinking of Bing Bong's farewell scene from ""Inside Out""), where it's rarely maudlin or saccharine, and is typically genuine and easily identifiable. The idea of being forgotten by your family is one that will hit home for parents watching the film, and the themes around family connections will be identifiable for both kids and adults. Setting the story aside for a second, I haven't even mentioned the film's lively music (""Remember Me"" is a real ear-worm), it's clever sense of humor (Miguel's street dog friend steals most every scene he's in), and the film's eye-popping visuals. It's also very cool for a major studio film to not feature a single anglo character and to instead feature a characters outside the dominant culture of the United States. My main complaint about the film is it's over reliance on plot devices and episodic adventures that were rather forced and relied once too often on coincidence, but I'm sure this will only annoy adults and the kids won't even notice. Overall, ""Coco"" is a solid entry in the Pixar canon of films, and although it's not quite up to ""Monsters Inc."" ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"" standards of greatness, it's still far better than any of the ""Cars"" movies.","Coco",5676,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5677",5,"  This movie is astoundingly lovely. The message is simple but meaningful. I loved the plot twist as well as the magnificent elements that Pixar used to spice up the misunderstanding between characters. Though soft but absolutely unforgettable.","Coco",5677,4.1,-0.9

"5684",5,"  Coco was a movie I didn't really know much about when I walked in to it, but I loved more than any Pixar movie before. It was heart warming, and caused me to cry at times. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, with a good message.","Coco",5684,4.1,-0.9

"5686",5,"  Coco is a film that returns Pixar to the days of old and what they are capable of. It is the best explanation of the Mexican Dia de Muertos celebration. Not as a macabre festival of death but a touching celebration of remembrance. The animation palette is rich and the voice acting sublime. Especially newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel.The story is a perfect family film for both kids and adults. It teaches us the importance of family and remembering those that have left us and what they contributed to our lives. Don't be afraid to let the tears flow.","Coco",5686,4.1,-0.9

"5704",4,"  Great production. You can see the passion through and through the entire production ranks. A couple of my favorites were in the storyline/plot, audio & visual, as well as pure creativity in execution. It would be 5 stars if I hadn't felt a sense of ""overdoing it"". There appeared to me various climatic points but they did end it off with a good bang. Left me feeling very good inside.","Coco",5704,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5705",4,"  Coco is a beautifully animated film with oodles of detail and a touching story great for families; it is very likely that it will win best-animated feature of the year. Coco is a movie about Dia de Los Muertos (The Day of the Dead) and Mexican culture, featuring a young boy, Miguel, who wants to be a musician despite his close families' contempt toward the idea. The film follows a semi-familiar path as Miguel does whatever he can to follow his dreams which end up leading him into another world, the place we go when we die. From there the movie goes beyond the simple message of following your dreams and becomes more about a wider range of themes such as life, death, family, success, and culture. Coco's story hits on many different subject matters and that is part of why it is so special; Coco is more than just pretty animation but it has something to say and show to people, it has a purpose in society. Not just that but Coco, from what I've heard, is very accurate when it comes to Mexican culture and tradition, showing that the creators behind the picture did their research and truly cared about the product they created. The voice actors did tremendous jobs with bringing their characters to life as their characters are vibrant and unique (as we've come to expect from Pixar) and the story is rich. Another thing that Coco did was be a little more mature than you would expect an animated film marketed towards children would be; there a couple of darker moments and twists that make the movie stand out from the wishy-washy animation thrown into theaters all the time. The visuals present in Coco were tremendous, you can clearly tell that the animators put all their time and effort into making the film the best version of itself. Every shot is full of detail and there is never a boring shot. From the lights to the fantastical creatures to the playing of music, everything was expertly crafted. The only downside I had with Coco was my failure to connect with the story and characters as much as others who know more about Mexican culture and tradition; this is, ?however, more of a me thing than it is a problem with the film. While I thought the film was excellently made, I couldn't connect to the characters as well as I could with those in other Pixar films such as Up and The Incredibles. While I think that Coco is easily the highest quality animated film of the year, I would be more likely to watch Lego Batman again (I probably just lost all of my credibility, didn't I?). I didn't even expect to see Coco in theaters but I did, and for those of you who don't expect to either, maybe you should reconsider (just an idea); Coco is a job well done.","Coco",5705,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5706",5,"  Even though its not a documentary, coco represents almost how Mexican culture celebrates Dia de Muertos . Well done Pixar!","Coco",5706,4.1,-0.9
"5707",5,"  Pixar does it again with Coco but the box office is more the good dinosaur.","Coco",5707,4.1,-0.9

"5714",4.5,NA,"Coco",5714,4.1,-0.4
"5715",4,"  Does Coco rise to the heights of Pixar's very best work? No. But it is a generous, heartfelt film, full of color and music, one that offers a timely Thanksgiving tribute to the intergenerational importance of family.","Coco",5715,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5716",5,"  I really liked it.And it turned out that Miguel's favorite singer actually poisoned the real singer Ector and stole his songs(Well at least let's just say that there were skeletons from the Land Of The Dead).","Coco",5716,4.1,-0.9
"5717",5,"  Beautiful and full of heart. I knew little of the Dia de Los Muertos holiday but this gave me not just a cultural lesson but a family oriented story. The brilliant colors dance throughout this movie. Many times I wanted the frame to stop, just so I could take in all the beautiful details in the multi-layer frame. The mix of Spanish into the English was just perfect.","Coco",5717,4.1,-0.9
"5718",5,"  Coco is a very beautiful animation with a very emotional story based on the family and the loss of loved ones. Pixar continues to offer high quality animated films offering humor and tears, with surprising visual technology. If I had to say something negative, it is that the story is something predictable, however it does not prevent the film from being enjoyable and touching the most sensitive fiber of the majority.","Coco",5718,4.1,-0.9
"5719",4.5,"  Great movie!!! Pixar once again delivers. My only fault, and this is more of a personal preference, is the music, not a fan of the Mariachi genre. Other than that the movie has no major flaws.","Coco",5719,4.1,-0.4
"5720",5,"  Beautiful music and an important message is one of Pixar's best films","Coco",5720,4.1,-0.9
"5721",4.5,"  A fantastic movie which not only left me entertained, but also helped me learn new things about Mexican Culture. The visuals are amazing, the story was fun, and the authenticity shined through in every aspect of the movie. I saw this movie on somewhat of a whim, but I'm very glad I did. The film has a few stagnant moments, but none distract from the film's great feel and fun cast.","Coco",5721,4.1,-0.4

"5737",5,"  I have been two times at Dia de Muertos and i can say that Coco efectively captures the true feeling of this celebration, but most of all it really grasps the beautiful relationships of family in latin america. I cried my heart out not because i was sad, but because i was filled with joy and amazement.","Coco",5737,4.1,-0.9
"5738",3,"  I don't think this is a brilliant movie by any stretch of the imagination (Pixar has had better moments for sure), but it is certainly beautiful, emotional and culturally relevant, so it definitely deserves my recommendation.","Coco",5738,4.1,1.1

"5744",5,"  Absolutely fantastic.","Coco",5744,4.1,-0.9
"5745",5,"  One of Pixar's best films! This one took me by complete surprise, it's such an emotional story that will definitely leave you in tears by the end. It pays such a tremendous amount of respect for Mexican culture and their portrayal of Day of the Dead shows that they took the necessary research to understand the true meaning of the Mexican holiday. That Frozen ""short"" was just overly long and should not have been played after nearly 20 minutes of previews before. I like Frozen, but it's vastly overrated.","Coco",5745,4.1,-0.9
"5746",5,"  Is there another star I can select. What an amazing movie. Coco frustrates me that the award shows have a best animated film category as I truly believe this movie should be considered with those nominated for best film. It's a triumph from start to finish. Our whole family loved it. The stunning visuals, the fabulous music, and most importantly, the heart. There's so much heart in this film. Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel is fantastic. There's not much more to say other than see this movie (bring Kleenex) but see this movie!","Coco",5746,4.1,-0.9
"5747",4.5,"  A new Disney Classic! It was so refreshing to experience such a heartwarming family story that was not the standard white nuclear family. I loved the beautiful imagery and rich characters. The plot was slightly predictable and the ending felt a little rushed. Great family film everyone should see.","Coco",5747,4.1,-0.4
"5748",5,"  Coco is a fresh air to the animated movies of this year,with good characters,emotions,but the best of coco is the plot, no many animated movies like to interact with the dead but coco manage out to make a good plot with it,a very emotional movie for this year.","Coco",5748,4.1,-0.9
"5749",4.5,"  Pixar delivers a culturally accurate and moving picture once again. It might feel a bit slow in some parts to your child. However, the kids will have fun and you will get to enjoy a genuine work of art. The themes are simple enough for kid's to learn important morals, and nuanced enough to be viscerally moving to adults. There is a movie here that everyone will love. Go watch!","Coco",5749,4.1,-0.4
"5750",5,"  Mi hizo llorar, genial","Coco",5750,4.1,-0.9
"5751",1,"  Very bad movie. Walked out at the 35 minute mark. Boring movie.","Coco",5751,4.1,3.1
"5752",4,"  A cute movie that tugs on the old heart strings. Visually BEAUTIFUL! The writing is good, not amazing but good. Dialog is where it lacks a little bit. The flagship song is sang in English during the movies entirety, which is a little disappointing. Watch or rent at least once.","Coco",5752,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"5753",4.5,"  Pixar has a long history of making beautiful movies that are classics and they now have another. The visuals and colors in Coco were stunning and the music was a joy, which is to be expected in a Pixar film now. What I really enjoyed about Coco was the illustration of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) and the Mexican culture. They did a fantastic job of capturing it and explaining every ritual's purpose. The dialogue is another pleasant surprising element of this film. The dialogue, plot and narrative was rich and has a great mix of drama, humor and pulls you in for the heart felt moments. It's hard to make a movie that is educational with beautiful visuals and entertaining, but Pixar encapsulated all three with Coco.","Coco",5753,4.1,-0.4
"5754",5,"  Really enjoyable movie, well done!","Coco",5754,4.1,-0.9
"5755",5,"  2nd best animated film of the year behind LEGO Batman & 2nd best Pixar movie behind Inside Out.","Coco",5755,4.1,-0.9
"5756",5,"  For years Pixar has created animated masterpieces that combine creative storytelling and great animation, but recently they have lost their magic touch but Coco has brought back the old Pixar. I can certainly saythis is one of the best films they have ever made. The animation is rich and vibrant and the story is well crafted, clever and full of heart. The emotional moments left me in tears and the overall message is very moving. I' looking forward to seeing this movie again soon.","Coco",5756,4.1,-0.9
"5757",1,"  Hollywood just keeps pumping out crap which the new Star Wars is close to falling into this realm. Or maybe it?s this millennial generation that has Hollywood moving along with the times, creating movies that suck.","Coco",5757,4.1,3.1
"5758",5,"  From 1995 to 2010 there was no doubt that Pixar was the greatest animation studio, producing huge critical and financial hits and travelling the audiences to their beautiful and imaginative worlds with their heartwarming, original and creative stories. Yes, they did make Cars back in 2006, but one film wasn't enough for the audiences to say goodbye to Pixar movies. Until that movie got a sequel. ""Cars 2"" divided audiences, leaving many widely unimpressed with its childish story. Then came ""Brave"", ""Monsters University"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"" which were all solid, but not even close to what people have come to expect from Pixar. There was still ""Inside Out"", which was a return to from and ""Finding Dory"" which was a very entertaining and succesful sequel to one of Pixar's biggest hits, 2003's ""Finding Nemo"". Earlier this year, Pixar released ""Cars 3"" which people just weren't interested in. It was better than ""Cars 2"" but still a far cry from the studio's best work. And while many thought ""Coco"" was just going to be a carbon copy of another film set in Mexico during the Day of the Dead, ""Book of Life"", the movie has actually turned out ot be one of the studio's most original, creative and breathtaking efforts yet.","Coco",5758,4.1,-0.9
"5759",5,"  Coco is probably the best Disney Pixar movie I have seen to date. A story that touches the heart strings of adults and children alike. Coco carries a deep message about the importance of family values. The winning formula to this movie is that Miguel is a nobody and yet he becomes our hero. The movie sets off a new inspiring narrative for children to follow where they need to have a stronger internal locus of control and believing in making their own journey a possibility.","Coco",5759,4.1,-0.9
"5760",5,"  This is my first time to cry at movie.","Coco",5760,4.1,-0.9
"5761",5,"  I love this movie , it made me cry!!","Coco",5761,4.1,-0.9
"5762",5,"  Coco is one of Pixar's greatest movies, and it had an enormous difference in quality to Pixar flops as Cars 3, The Great Dinosaur, Monsters University, Brave, and Cars 2; a quality that wasn't seem since Inside-Out. The movie clearly is out of Mexican stereotypes and it shows a great query of that country's culture; in addition to it's well-created plot and screenplay, it's stunning visuals reached by an incredible CGI animation, and a good design and developments of it's lovable characters.","Coco",5762,4.1,-0.9
"5763",5,"  Of all the comic book based movies of both D.C. and Marvel; this one ranked with the best! Certainly the best of the D.C. movies other then the Dark Knight.If I go further, I give away the storyline.A must see movie!","Coco",5763,4.1,-0.9
"5764",5,"  Surely one of the best animated movies I've seen in a while. The characters are relatable and feel alive. The plot seems a little bit like it has been done before but doesn't feel forced, cliched and is not really predictable and the animation is just amazing. The music is great and there are scenes that get really emotional. The way they portray mexican culture and family values feels realistic and you can tell that they did lots of research and did not just rely on stereotypes. Kind of a SPOILER here:What amazed me most about this movie how it could handle a very dark and mature story and cover it up with beautiful, creative and unique animation style.Beside the fact that the movie started out a little bit strange it just improves every minute and makes the ending feel perfect.If you haven't seen this one already, go watch it! A great adventure for children of all ages and even adults.","Coco",5764,4.1,-0.9
"5765",4.5,"  Coco is a fun movie. Not only are the visuals gorgeous, the colors are vibrant along with a beautiful backdrop. The only reason there is a missing half a star is because it began to feel a bit long right before the large reveal about the main villain of the film. Luckily, it comes back and gets better right after.","Coco",5765,4.1,-0.4
"5766",5,"  Pixar's Coco delivers a heartwarming story about the importance of family, phenomenal animation that's bursting with color, energy, and creativity, and lovable characters.","Coco",5766,4.1,-0.9

"5768",4,"  It's been a while since I have really enjoyed a Pixar film, but Coco is one of the best that they have put out. It's not as good as say Toy Story (3 is my favorite actually), or The Incredibles, but it is very worthy. While watching this film I was taken back to one of my all time favorites The Jungle Book. The relationship between Miguel and those who are trying to help him out, especially Hector, just reminds me of Baloo and Mowgli. The movie really speaks to how we remember and honor those that we love who have passed, and how this certainly isn't something easy for us to do. The colors and lights are extremely beautiful, and I enjoyed the songs even though they do not speak to me as a style I normally would like. It's interesting that there is a bit of a lull at the end of the second act and I thought the movie was losing steam, but the final act is very much worth it, and has just spoke to me. It's not a perfect film, but man is it way better then many of the animated movies that Pixar has put out in recent years. I didn't like it quite as much as last year's Kubo and the Two Strings, but very close, and the two films actually touch on many of the same subjects.","Coco",5768,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5782",5,"  Coco was a fantastic movie for me. I loved the colors, the songs, the story behind it all, the message. It was a fantastic movie. Very well done! Unfortunately, for a kid its too long and serious. I love that Disney/ Pixar likes targeting the entire family and is always sending a great message but the movies are just too serious for kids. I have an after school program, ages 5 - 12 years old, and for our Thanksgiving Camp we took the kids to see Coco. The movie is a good chunk of time for any kid. Kids do not have the attention spam of an adult, they get bored easily and thats exactly what happened about 30 min into the movie. And this was mostly in part of the Frozen short film that was shown prior, which lasted about 25 minutes if I'm not mistaken. The short film had all the kids puzzled and aggravated they just did not know what was going on and why they were watching Olaf sing. Then Coco began and as I mentioned 30 minutes into the movie they were all ready to go and do something else. So a good hour is what kids can handle. Hopefully, other can see what I see.","Coco",5782,4.1,-0.9
"5783",5,"  Over the years since computer animation became a new medium, Pixar welcomes us with enriched storytelling that opened up new worlds from added sentimentality to something that's further wondrous. Our toys have feelings, it's tough to be a bug, monsters comes out of your closet from their world, finding family under the sea that covers most of the world, family of superheroes, what it like to go fast and slow down once in a while, what rats think about food, a cleaning robot healing a dystopian environment, an old man granting a late wish for an adventure, having control of your fate, knowing your emotions, and what if dinosaurs weren't extinct. And now, Pixar presents a story that's probably the most special out of the rest when telling a story around a cultural tradition with an enlarged meaning. Ladies and gentlemen, both dead and alive, embrace yourselves for the heart in ""Coco"".The story gracefully embraces, with much respect, the Mexican cultures with the pinnacle being the traditional holiday known as the Day of the Dead. It follows the young 12-year-old boy Miguel (voiced by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) trying to follow his dream of music like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz (voiced by Benjamin Bratt), but is forbidden to go down that path since it caused devastation of abandonment in the far past to his family. So the ban on music has been passed for generations in the family to avoid the heartbreak and the destructive ego for the individual that wants to go down that path, even though Miguel's heart is pure and loving towards his family, and desperately passionate towards music. His chance to prove his talent led him to the Land of the Dead, where he'll find out there's more to his family story than what any, both alive and dead, have known.It's always an insightful experience to interact and getting to know a different culture besides the one you're automatically accustomed to since birth, and Pixar delivers that feeling through another of their masterpieces. ""Coco"" is more of a step-up for Pixar in their qualities that are like blood cells flowing in the veins through the films: animation's more beautiful and creative, excellent performances and music, humanizing characterization, thematic elements, and heartfelt emotions; emotional soul with an adventurous heart. The addition of culture is now another of the added quality that broadens Pixar's storytelling capabilities. ""Ratatouille"" and ""Brave"" may have expressed culture but only in minimal aspects that doesn't really touch base to the origin beyond the film when it was just senses and fate in a fantasy setting, respectively. ""Coco"" manifested the Mexican culture through soul (animated and music) and vocal (talented voicing), as well meaning.While the main concept surrounds the Day of the Dead that branches out thematic elements across the film, the main theme is the love and value of family. The story of love and family is familiar in past animated films, as well when it becomes stressful if the protagonist has to be rebellious for a dream, this film follows that routine with emphasis on the stress part and a loving understanding that would exclude the supposed harshness. There's an eventual twist that occurs near the climax, and the rest from there make it more emotionally heartfelt and meaningful. The theme of family is perhaps the most outstanding quality that you won't stop thinking about after the film ends, and you'll look forward on seeing it unfolds again next time.In addition to the Mexican holiday, the film is utterly faithful to the culture in numerous aspects from the music to the performances. Probably one of the best music composers in most recent time Michael Giacchino continued his acclaimed talented taste for music to be closer to the story in tune, and this time the musical instruments were those of Mexican culture. It helps the film to be pure culture from story to tradition to solidify the soul as something special and unique from the generic presentation of others on American soil attempting culture - with not much known as of now. The vocals accompaniment were stellar and well-performed, both singing and non-singing, thanks to the all Latino cast (minus regular John Ratzenberger, whose voice wouldn't be detected anyway). Those performances put emphasis on the film's defining aspects, particularly the emotional heart and value of family, with Gonzalez's breakthrough spirited performance as the young protagonist being the standout. What manifested the culture the most, particularly the holiday as the film's concept, is in the Land of the Dead as the always-astonishing animation humanizes the skeleton characters. The reason why the skeleton characters are being given such attention for the animated merit isn't just because more than half of the film is Miguel's adventure, interaction and pursuit in the Land of the Dead but because of what they represent and how they can get attached indirectly by family ties due to the emotional embodiment of the characters. Creativity is also in the mix with the random persona of the skeletons clacking and briefly transforming their bone structures; which is another of the step-up element in the film from the masterfully detailed animation that you would expect as another special treat from Pixar.""Coco"", directed and written by Lee Unkirch and Adrian Molina, is just your average Pixar originality with greatness and such attention to all aspects for the purpose of a heartwarming, wonderful storytelling. Actually, with the thoughtful and faithful respect for the Mexican culture being an added-on that paints over the typical production merits and narrative qualities, and while it's obviously and definitely this year's best animated feature, it's perhaps the best from Pixar over ""Toy Story 3"" and a tiny bit over ""Inside Out"".

"5794",4,"  **Slight disclaimer: My ""reviews,"" are really just gut reactions that I can remember and jot down. Forgive the sloppy styling, grammatical errors and general upheaval of my writing. While I do try and write something cohesive and obeying film review etiquette, mostly, I say fuck that. What I love about theater going, is the surge of emotions I experience, especially during a particularly bad or a truly great film. I try (and likely fail) to translate that feeling into my writing but hey, I warned you. You can stop now, and I'll never know.CocoWatched 12/3/2017I don't watch kid's movies, I don't review kids movies, I don't really like kids movies, because I am an idiot. That mentality is so dangerous and ignorant because, I just saw an amazing film. It also just so happened to be a film made for children.Disney and Pixar studios, with directors Lee Unkrich, and Adrian Molina created the dazzling, Coco.Let me backup. I just want to put it on front street just how lovely and charming and gorgeous this film is. Before Coco even started, I was already fatigued and tired. I was nearly ready to leave the theater, I just witnessed 30 minutes of various Disney trailers and commercials and then that mind numbing, 22 minute (felt more like 92 minutes) Frozen short played. So, I had already been in the theater for an hour before Coco even started.But as soon as it did...I was hooked. We are introduced to one of the most beautiful cinematic worlds I've ever been in. It was like what Guillermo Del Toro imagines when he gets gassed at the dentist. We bounce between two amazing environments. A very real Mexican village and a very un-real Land of the Dead, both are overflowing with color, culture, music, lights, boisterous characters, zany animals, and most of all music.I knew nothing about this movie going in, so I'll return the favor.Just know that it's not the most original or crazily unique story I've seen. A similar film The Book of Life was released just a few years ago. Yet Coco captured my imagination, it's asks universal questions that we want answers to. It's done so that, a six-year-old and a sixty-year-old can go into this film and both come out feeling uplifted and pleased. There is some heavy subject matter here that will go over the heads of kids, but sorta fucked me up. Dealing with the ever-increasing awareness of mortality, disappearing heritage, and our forgotten ancestors. Being of Mexican and Spanish descent myself, certain aspects of this movie hit me on unexpected levels. The resolution of the film closes nicely, yet the thoughts occupied my headspace for a while after exiting the theater. Anyways, on to something happier.The voice acting is phenomenal, the film is largely music based and the range of voices unleashed on us is terrific. Our main character Miguel, played lovingly by new actor Anthony Gonzalez, the velvety, instantly recognizable voice of Gael Garcia Bernal, the boisterous bellow of Benjamin Bratt, the feisty Renee Victor and the numerous vocal cameos throughout the film. Collectively, it felt so alive and real that it may be the best voice cast I've heard from both studios.I know the Disney/Pixar conglomerate does amazing work. I liked Toy Story, and Monsters Inc, and Nemo, I am human. I just don't go out of my way to see them. Coco along with many other films this year continue to remind me of the fact that films (kids or otherwise) shouldn't be judged, they should be experienced. Why judge a movie simply based on its targeted demographic? If it does what it's supposed to do and is seems interesting, go see it, give it the chance to surprise you. This is why I love film so much, I am always learning from them, I get life and inspiration from awesome movies and I am so lucky that I can share that love and enthusiasm with my friends and readers.Unless it's that Frozen short...that totally sucked.","Coco",5794,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5804",4.5,"  A beautiful animation that shows culture and heart. Despite his family's baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel (voice of newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin Bratt). Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events. Along the way, he meets charming trickster Hector (voice of Gael García Bernal), and together, they set off on an extraordinary journey to unlock the real story behind Miguel's family history.To be completely honest, I had only seen one trailer for this film and I had zero interest. I barely knew what it was about other than Pixar was releasing this film. And to be frank, I just really didn't want to see it. However when I visited my hometown in Washington for Thanksgiving, I decided to utilize my MoviePass and take a trip to the theaters. To no surprise, I really enjoyed the film. It surpassed my expectations and it's definitely a film that I'll remember. To start off, this film is absolutely stunning. Pixar shows us why they're one of the best, if not the best animation studios in existence. The artists and the animators behind this film did a fantastic job. Everything looked extremely detailed and it looked crazy. Every fine grain and every color was given careful attention to and it definitely showed. This honestly looks better than any other animation I've seen this year and it's easily one of Pixar's most beautiful films. The overall story is very strong and emotional. The base of this film is really simple, if not a little bit cliche. But the writers here really knew what kind of film they wanted it to be and that's what made it special. Every beat in this film was so well written and it blew any ""generic"" possibility out of the water. It's an adventure for a young boy who loves music and it certainly doesn't disappoint. The story is exciting, eventful, and it kept me hooked throughout. I think this is just a really beautiful animation in general. It has a lot of strong motifs and themes that can be applied to many parts of our daily lives. It's something that can appeal to both mass audiences and small niches because it's not just a kids film. It's a kids film that can be entertaining for older audiences. There are just so many aspects that mesh well together and it makes this a very nice and heart warming film.In the end, ""Coco"" was a fantastic film and one of the highlights of the year.","Coco",5804,4.1,-0.4
"5805",5,"  The afterlife has been at the center of many films in the past. Man's fascination with death and what may come afterward has always been a wealthy fodder for faith and art, and cinema is no exception. Since 1911's L'INFERNO ( Giuseppe De Liguoro, Adolfo Padovan, Francesco Bertolini) portrayed a chilling vision of Dante's hell, the after-world has been a constant presence in movies, being visited on occasion by Hercules, Santo, or even Robin Williams. Its portrayal has been at times grim, terrifying, institutional or spectacular.Pixar's COCO falls into that latest category. It's probably the most gorgeous depiction of the Great Beyond, with its vibrant bridge of flowing petals linking the world of the living to a stunningly colourful Netherworld. The contrast could have been expressed in the same way the land of the dead was distinguished from the real world by having the latter look desaturated, like in Burton's THE CORPSE BRIDE. But directors Lee Unkrich (TOY STORY 2 and 3) and Adrian Molina tried a different approach.The Mexican town in which lives young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) remains sunny and vibrant, exhibiting all the bright festive hues associated with the Dia de Muertos celebrations, and yet the afterlife still manages to turn the colour knob all the way to 11.COCO follows the adventures of young Miguel, who wants nothing more than become a musician like the celebrated Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), thus defying the family's shoe-making tradition. As he attempts to ''borrow'' the deceased Ernesto's guitar from his crypt, he is sent to the Land of the Dead, and can only return home if a dead relative offers him his blessings. Not an easy task, as his dead family, like the living one, opposes his dreams of being a musician. They resent Miguel's great-grandfather who left his family to pursue his own musical ambitions, never to return.Deeply rooted in a Mexican culture, COCO nonetheless suffers from Disney boiling down the essence of that very culture to often trite stereotypes; The dead sports the decorated sugar skulls associated with Día de Muertos. You get mariachis, Frida Kahlo and masked wrestlers (with a cameo appearance by the Legendary Santo in the After Life). However, it's difficult in an animated movie to stay away from cultural clichés, as was the case with the Guillermo Del Toro produced THE BOOK OF LIFE, which shares a certain amount of plot points with COCO. They also fish out other worthwhile aspects of Hispanic folklore in inspired moments, like for instance a traditional song about la Llorona (A spine-chilling fable about a crying woman's ghost, forever mourning her slain children). Furthermore, there has been attempts of late by Disney/Pixar to redeem themselves by avoiding the typical whitewashing. MOANA had Hawaiian actors and The Rock (who has Samoan descent) playing Polynesians, all citizens of the wider Pacific Islands. In COCO, the cast is mostly populated by Hispanics. While some of them are well known performers, none are of the calibre of the stars that often do voices in such animated fare. Although it can be argued that Disney doesn't really need stars to sell at this point, and that type of casting can further help to absolve the lack of cultural subtlety. COCO further tried to ''pander'' by having its premiere in Mexico, a whole week ahead of the rest of the world.What matters in the end is the movie's impact, and in this case, COCO packs a heck of an sentimental wallop. Like most Pixar movies, it grounds its story in a very human principle which in this case is our relationship with the afterlife, and this need to be remembered. It's the basic emotional core of COCO, and it reaches a particular crescendo when the titular character, who is a secondary player in appearance, but drives the whole story, is starting to forget about one of her dead relative, threatening to cause his ''second death'' in the the Land of the Dead. It brings home some powerful concepts that may escape the kiddies, but that most adults will be able to relate to. It's particularly poignant to name a movie that deals mostly with the importance of living in one's memories, after a character who is obviously battling Alzheimer's disease. The scene where Miguel attempts to jog her remembrance with a song (a technique that has proven effective in real life) that had until then being used in a rather smarmy way in the film, will make the most hardhearted cry their eyes out.In short, Pixar has done it again, creating a touching, gorgeous and ultimately relevant movie that will bring a certain amount of food for thoughts to the young and older ones, dazzle with its vibrant palette, and stand the test of time with its strong emotional core, providing an answer to the query posed by its Oscar bait of a theme song: ''Remember me.''We certainly will.","Coco",5805,4.1,-0.9

"5807",4.5,"  The Book of Life was one of my favorite films of 2014. When I first saw the trailer for Coco, it was hard not for me to draw comparisons. A celebration of the Day of the Dead. Mariachi. Centered around music. Coco brings its own flavor, however, a unique experience all its own. In fact, if it weren't for the god-awful twenty-five-minute Frozen short right before (since removed due to numerous complaints), this would have been close to a perfect moviegoing experience.Little Miguel loves music. He has to sneak away to watch old recordings of his favorite musician Ernesto de la Cruz because the rest of his family thinks music is a curse. Following a mysterious chain of events (don't want to ruin it for you), Miguel finds himself in the Land of the Dead and must somehow find a way to get home before its too late.The colors. Oh man, the colors. Vibrant, popping off the screen. It screams life even during the scenes in the Land of the Dead. This is one film I wish I would have seen in IMAX. The colors add an amazing pop, from the spirit animals to the city landscapes at night, making this one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen.The colors alone are just a small touch to the overall creativity and originality behind Coco. The Land of the Dead is loaded with sights to behold, some you might miss if you blink. The attention to detail is spectacular from the cool bridge that guides the dead to the Land of the Living to the colorful spirit animals. I've seen a lot of movies and I haven't seen anything like this. Not only are the visuals amazing, but the music holds its own as well, driving the entire story in an entertaining and powerful way. There are a lot of touching moments that revolve around the soundtrack. There will be musical numbers that make you laugh while others leave you with more of a somber feel. Maybe I cried a little. Maybe I didn't. You'll never know for sure. One thing I can say is this movie was about as touching as any I have seen this year.Disney/Pixar is known for leaving you with a great message and Coco is no exception. Miguel was willing to follow his dreams at all costs, even if it cost him his life. How many of us can say the same? Another phenomenal job by Pixar. I give the film a 96.","Coco",5807,4.1,-0.4

"5810",4,"  'Coco' is a surprisingly touching and enjoyable adventure. It always tackles sensitive topics such as death and familial feud with engaging performances and fun, heartwarming moments. One can tell that care went into making sure that there is as little dead space in between events and that slower scenes are still beautiful and entertaining. The music is noteworthy too, as it should be for a film of this kind, and serves as a vehicle that connects the audience to Mexico and its culture.

"5821",4,"  A standard retelling of the hero's journey can get predictable (see: Robots).

The answers given in Coco are a little too neat and tidy, but that doesn't mean that the movie doesn't offer genuine emotion through its visuals, its music, and its story. While the world-building isn't as imaginative as Inside Out or WALL-E, the design of the Land of the Dead is something to behold, a Pixar version of a less-depressing Blade Runner.","Coco",5821,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"5831",5,"  Let me preface my review by saying this. I'm against illegal immigration (And overly-generous ""legal"" immigration. I hate pushin 1 for english, and I'm pretty pissed that my kid's neighborhood school was turned into a nursery for anchor babies and outright illegals, and he was kicked-out becuz he doesn't speak SPANISH! I realize that Hollywood is without xception, diametrically opposed to my position on these issues, so I went into Coco, xpecting to see a thinly-veiled political agenda, but, all I saw was a brilliantly-animated, heartwarming, story, with some surprise plot twists. As parents, we must frequently ""take 1 for the team"", and take our kids to movies we know are gonna be awful, cuz they wanna see'em, but, rest easy, Mom n Dad, while we might feel the ticket price could be abit lower, takin the shorties to see Coco's money well-spent!

"5835",3,"  Relatively good movie. The animation and sound was amazing. and it sent a good message to kids that violence is never the answer. Though, as a teenager I didn't enjoy it much. It was overall cheesy and kinda immature in some places. I also personally didn't like how clumsily lucky he was. He should have been dead by the time he got to Nina's farm.","Ferdinand",5835,3.1,0.1
"5836",2.5,"  Blue Sky, we need to talk. So based on a children's book from the 1930s, this is about an oversized bull with a gentle heart, Ferdinand (John Cena). All he wants to do is smell the flowers and live with his family in Spain, but it seems that destiny is determined to pull him into the bull fighting life that he has tried so hard to get away from. Now if there is someone out there that can give this movie a fair chance, it's me. I love family oriented animation, and more often than not, I tend to connect with movies of this type to the point of defending them, sometimes undeservedly so. This got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but that's not saying much, as it is no secret that the Academy doesn't take animation seriously (see: The Boss Baby). So how does Ferdinand stack up? Well, I think kids will like it fine, but I can't say that there is really much here for adults. Now to this movie's credit, this actually starts off stronger than I expected. I did sincerely enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes of setup where we learn about Ferdinand's backstory and get introduced to the family that adopts him. It is rare that I can pinpoint when a movie ceases to work, but it is precisely when Kate McKinnon shows up as a comfort goat. I think she is a talented actress, but the only purpose she serves here is just to be the zany sidekick, and they don't have really much of anything written for her to do. It is just a lot of weak sight gags, and none of them really have any payoff. It then starts to become more generic for the following second act... and then something unexpected happens. I do not consider this to be a spoiler because it has absolutely nothing to do with the forward movement of the plot, but right around the hour mark, this turns into Bring It On with no warning or reason. I mean really, all of these bulls have a dance off against these three horses that inexplicably have German accents, and it ends up being highly surreal and out of place. I don't think Cena does badly with his voice acting, but I do think he still has a ways to go before he reaches the status that Dwayne Johnson is currently at. I liked Ferdinand as a character as well, as he is basically like a giant dog who doesn't know his own size, but all of the side characters got on my nerves as time went on. It's watchable, but it is just very DreamWorks, if you follow me. I would say show it to your kids, but then again, kids have no idea who this character is, so they probably won't be excited for this. If this didn't get lazy after the first act, I might have been able to give this a low recommendation, but as it stands, it ends up being a bit of a misfire.","Ferdinand",5836,3.1,0.6
"5837",3,"  So they don't dance around the fact that the bulls die when they face the matador. It's actually a pretty dark premise for a kids' movie. I had a few laughs, but I won't be seeing this one again anytime soon.","Ferdinand",5837,3.1,0.1
"5838",4.5,"  Not bad film I like it. Ferdinand is a fun and good family film I ever watch with very good visuals and very well done likable characters but the thing is about this film is that its a fun film but it did not have the charm and the heart warming feeling that coco has plus the animation is good but not beautiful and artistic like coco has but you know what I have fun and this was a fun film to watch. Overall Ferdinand is a fun film for the whole family to watch even though it did not have the charm and the heart warming feeling that coco had but it was a well done animated family fun film that i enjoy it and have fun watching it. Well done Blue Sky Studios you guys made a well done and fun family animated film and I like and plus bulls are awesome and kind. good job and well done.","Ferdinand",5838,3.1,-1.4
"5839",1,"  The movie tried to do too much and should have stuck more with the original story. It's filler in trying to make it movie length was forgettable and at times exhausting.","Ferdinand",5839,3.1,2.1
"5840",3.5,"  In a desperate attempt to escape the life of a fighting bull, Ferdinand (John Cena) escapes to a life of smelling flowers and relaxing in a peaceful farm. However, when he ends up back at his old home after being mistaken for a fierce bull, it's up to Ferdinand and an optimistic goat (Kate McKinnon) to convince the other bulls of the possibilities of a better life beyond the arena...As with most short children's books that are expanded to feature length narratives such as The Polar Express, The Grinch and The Lorax, Blue Sky Studios's adaptation of Munro Leaf's 1936 children's book, The Story of Ferdinand does tend to drag out it's narrative with annoying slapstick and pointless subplots.However, the beautiful background animation of Spain, John Cena's suprisingly good voice acting and the heart of the source material remaining intact, does make this film a lot more tolerable than those films and much like 2015's excellent adaptation of Peanuts, it proves that Blue Sky Studios is capable of producing quality work that isn't Ice Age related.Overall, Ferdinand is a cute little animal flick that doesn't offer much surprises, but has it's heart in the right place and is mostly harmless family fun.","Ferdinand",5840,3.1,-0.4
"5841",3,"  From Mexico to Spain, this year is very internationalFERDINAND Looking back, this year hasn't been the greatest when it comes to the animation genre. Apart from the obvious Pixar's masterpiece Coco, there haven't been any standouts that demanded a second watching from me. I haven't watched The Breadwinner yet but how does Ferdinand and The Boss Baby get to be considered two of the five best movies of the year? I miss Ghibli's annual nomination which, like, Pixar used to give us consistent masterful works every single year. And it's not that Ferdinand is bad but it's certainly no more than mediocre. It's a movie with the complexity of, for example, Rio which was no wonder either. And although the main character is immensely lovable, he's surrounded by archetypes who don't get to further themselves. Even the script denies itself the opportunity to delve in its heaviest themes, as it dodges every opportunity of a strong emotional punch in order not to scar young audiences. You know, kids are progressively less impressionable and sure, cohesive and straight-forward storytelling will cut it for them but it will not, however, be enough for us. There would be so much potential to send an anti bullfighting message with this film but it shies away from that. Ferdinand is, for the lack of a better word, a breeze. You are mildly entertained and then it ends. Its greatest flaw may be the lack of what true filmmaking has to spare: subtext. And that means the difference between breaking a china shop and grabbing the bull by the horns","Ferdinand",5841,3.1,0.1

"5875",5,"  If you are interested on teaching your kid to be itself and not always follow what the rest say, this is the perfect movie to watch. Ferdinand, besides its beautiful scenes and amazing explanation of Spain traditions, it presents a unique concept that it is not often mentioned. As competitive human beings, we usually try to do a better job than anyone else on Earth no matter the situation. Unfortunately, the way we do things is not usually special and we tend to follow a common procedure on how to be successful. Meanwhile, Ferdinand teaches as that by following our own way of being, we can reach all the goals we set in our mind and make them reality.","Ferdinand",5875,3.1,-1.9

"5877",3.5,"  Charming, often quite funny, and fairly old-fashioned (though not in an unwelcome manner). Surprisingly for a modern animated kids movie, it's also not afraid to actually have the darkness of the real-world in it overtly as central to the latter parts of the story (albeit in fairly typically light fashion, but still, it's there).","Ferdinand",5877,3.1,-0.4
"5878",3,"  The youngest in the house enjoyed it. Overall, a bit clunky, and the voice work wasn't great, but not a terrible way to spend some time with the youngster.","Ferdinand",5878,3.1,0.1

"5880",5,"  Loved it. Doesn't matter no one else did. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely not a child's movie and I'm totally against bullfighting, and wonder who on earth came up the the thought to use it in an animation. All in all though thankfully, a happy ending unlike real bull torture.","Ferdinand",5880,3.1,-1.9
"5881",1,"  A hopelessly lacklustre animation from Blue Sky Studios, the company responsible for a long line of increasingly poor Ice Age sequels, I'm not even sure it's supposed to be funny, since huge chunks of time pass by without even as much as a smile being raised. Almost every joke is a running gag which started out not being funny and then proceeds to be run into the ground. The obligatory quirky sidekick is little more than a repetitive annoyance, most of the characters are cheap stereotypes, the ending can be guessed within minutes, and the film breaks out its dance montage within 20 minutes. John Cena does his best, but he's playing the lead character who wants to do their own thing despite everyone else telling them to conform, which seems to be the default status for every children's film protagonist, and it does absolutely nothing new with this premise. It's a sad indicator of the state of animated films that this gets an Academy Award nomination and The Lego Batman Movie doesn't.","Ferdinand",5881,3.1,2.1

"5883",1.5,"  I have no idea who decided it was a good idea to make a kids movie about bull fighting. The characters are generic and boring with no redeeming qualities. The movie was cute and decent until Kate McKinnons character, the most annoying ""side kick"" character ever, made the movie almost unbearable. Then throw in the German horses that only speak in memes and 10 year old slang, and you realize Fox animation was never going to learn from Disney to make their animated movies actually bearable for the parents being dragged into it. They can't even copy Pixars generic plot without screwing that up. Glad Disney bought them out. Maybe they'll clean house and make something watchable.The only positive I can give this movie is John Cena's voice acting is great and I hope he does many more films.","Ferdinand",5883,3.1,1.6

"5887",2,"  it's about time we meet again..FerdinandThe animated features are supposed to attract the viewers into their new and attention seeking world and to be rich in details which helps connecting to them, unfortunately none of it is offered in here. Just a mere idea is projected by Carlos Saldanha; the director, which already was present in the original book and addition to that, it fails on delivering what was already there too. John Cena at the centre of it, is quite convincing but in here Kate McKinnon steals the show as her character is strong too along with her work. Ferdinand is a forward pass in its first act and a complete downer on its second one where all the clichéd characters and sequences jumps in that awaits and predicts the last act that even though being exhilarating (the chase scene is the only high point of the feature) couldn't charm anyone.","Ferdinand",5887,3.1,1.1

"5894",3.5,"  It can't go to toe-to-toe with Coco for the animation Oscar, but Ferdinand represents a step forward in quality for Blue Sky Studios. They've managed to infuse their usual brand of frenetic storytelling and frantic humor with a nice adherence to the source material. It a shiny piece of animation for modern day families but telling a timely and poignant story that culminates in a touching match in the arena. This is predictable fluff, but actually hilarious, the German stallions had me guffawing, and John Cena and Kate McKinnon do great vocal work. What I think would improve Blue Sky's efforts on a more technical level, would be the fleshing out of the backgrounds and a more unique visual style. The animation is nice but very basic and not filled in as much as one would expect from Pixar. Still, Ferdinand is often too frantic, but its message is strong and its a pleasant way to spend an afternoon at the movies. In a year with few good animation offerings, this one at least ended the year stronger. Rating: 72","Ferdinand",5894,3.1,-0.4

"5897",1.5,"  The voiceover work is good, with John Cena turning in a decent performance as a the gentle giant. And unlike The Emoji Movie before it, Ferdinand actually has a bit of heart to it. Unfortunately, the film's scenes are cobbled together and copied from other, better adventures. The pacifist message of the movie is not exactly new, but it feels especially out-of-place in the violent world of bullfighting. It's very similar to the theme of 1998's Pokemon: The First Movie, and like that movie, the message is meaningless once the movie ends, because we all know that the pacifism does nothing for the world of the movie.","Ferdinand",5897,3.1,1.6

"5923",4.5,"  I really enjoyed this movie with my children. I found myself smiling the whole way through. My kids were completely engrossed. Ages 5 and 9.","Ferdinand",5923,3.1,-1.4
"5924",5,"  GREAT movie - very funny - and poignant. Well acted and beautiful to look at.","Ferdinand",5924,3.1,-1.9
"5925",4,"  These people are crazy. great movie. lots of laughs","Ferdinand",5925,3.1,-0.9
"5926",1.5,"  Ferdinand is chock full of annoying characters, flaws in the plotline and a happy ending.","Ferdinand",5926,3.1,1.6

"5928",5,"  Went to see this movie with my 4 year old grandson after taking him to see Coco. BOTH are great movies. BOTH are suitable for young children and have good moral values. I suspect Ferdinand is rated lower because of its ""pacifist"" bent. It seems these days that there is not even a debate about all the violence in which our government engages around the world in OUR names. Ferdinand is a bull who does not want to fight. He loves flowers and everything beautiful about the world. He is a ""flower child"" so to speak even though he is the biggest and strongest bull. When he has a chance to get the upper hand against the ""evil"" bullfighter, he just sits down and engages his eyes. As a 69 year old survivor of the Vietnam era, I loved this movie and its morality. My grandson was very tired but it held his attention throughout. And it certainly held mine. If you liked Coco, you will like Ferdinand.","Ferdinand",5928,3.1,-1.9
"5929",4.5,"  It was a fun, hilarious animated movie. I just thought it was good, but my dad said it could have been better or worse. I thought the humor was great, so go ahead and see it if you haven't already and think about how you feel for Ferdinand.","Ferdinand",5929,3.1,-1.4
"5930",3.5,"  Though ""Ferdinand' is predictable and thinly plotted, it's still a funny and heartfelt animated film that benefits from the charming voice performances from John Cena and Kate McKinnon.","Ferdinand",5930,3.1,-0.4
"5931",4,"  While this movie does have a good amount of great comedy, it also has a good amount of great heart. Through Ferdinand's journey back home, the audience sees how his selflessness and good personality changes those he meets. From the companions he had as a young calf, to the new friends he makes on the way, even to the climatic bullfight in Madrid, the gentle giant inspires and changes everyone's views of him by being himself. John Cena did a fantastic job as the title bull as did the rest of the cast. The animation is excellent, especially in the comedic chase sequence near the end of the film. This is a great family movie, and I will definitely be buying this on Blu-ray when it comes out. 8/10","Ferdinand",5931,3.1,-0.9
"5932",4,"  I'm surprised by all the negative reviews! I love kids movies and thought this one was very cute. Definitely not my favorite/not on par with Pixar movies, but a good story (although predictable) and funny.","Ferdinand",5932,3.1,-0.9
"5933",1,"  A shitty painfully unfunny film with a extremely predictable story.","Ferdinand",5933,3.1,2.1
"5934",4,"  Surprisingly funny and refreshing","Ferdinand",5934,3.1,-0.9
"5935",5,"  Screw the critics! This movie was great.","Ferdinand",5935,3.1,-1.9
"5936",3.5,"  Ferdinand is a bull's hit. Movie has a simple story about a big big bull with kind heart. It is really simple and straight forward for kids to understand and enjoy Ferdinand. John Cena is already loved by kids and they are gonna love his voice as lead character. Animation team has kept this in basic 3D and not the realistic animation that makes it looks good. The sequence in the grocery store and the market will bring smile on your face. The sequence with the rabbit, the Hedgehogs are good to watch and viewers will appreciate dance competition between horses and the bulls. They were cool. Ferdinand is a good animation movie and will be appreciated by viewers. One can say it is a lite entertaining movie with moral. One can appreciate the Spanish city themes and the Spanish music running in background too.","Ferdinand",5936,3.1,-0.4

"5939",5,"  I'm surprised how badly rated it is. It was actually a very good animation. It teaches kids about compassion and about being kind. Also it's funny but also a tear jerker. Great show! Makes me not wanna eat meat though (:","Ferdinand",5939,3.1,-1.9
"5940",4,"  great movie with interesting cast voice ð???ð???","Ferdinand",5940,3.1,-0.9
"5941",4,"  Kate Mckinnon almost ruined this sweet heart warming movie. Her character was completely obnoxious... kinda like her in real life.","Ferdinand",5941,3.1,-0.9
"5942",3,"  Ferdinand has its cute and charming moments on top of having some good animation and successfully capturing the heart and soul of its source material by keeping the message from the book, but the big problem that keeps this movie from being great is that it feels really drawn out and slow paced at times. Not to mention that the comic reliefs are really annoying. I think if they removed the comedic sidekicks, and focused only on the bulls and humans, this movie would have been so much better. But as it is, it's OK. Nothing to really rush to, but it's relatively harmless.","Ferdinand",5942,3.1,0.1
"5943",4,"  It was a fun movie, my wife and I liked it.","Ferdinand",5943,3.1,-0.9
"5944",3,"  It took me half an hour, but eventually Ferdinand won me over. My 3 year old got bored, but my 5 year old enjoyed it.The humor takes a while to get going, but there are some laughs.The horses were great.I think Ferdinand?s strength lies at its heart. It does give you the warm fuzzies and leaves you smiling.These movies are a dime a dozen these days. A few a great, many fall short..... Ferdinand is somewhere in the middle.Good and worth a look.","Ferdinand",5944,3.1,0.1
"5945",1.5,"  My 7 year old daughter loved it. I would rather have gone to the dentist. Definitely NOT certified fresh.","Ferdinand",5945,3.1,1.6
"5946",5,"  I really enjoyed this film. I don't particularly understand all the audience hate for this film. There were some real shining moments in this film and the 4 kids that I took to see this film liked it better than Coco (I did too). The characters were loveable and the story endearing. I have a feeling your kids will absolutely love this movie even if you are a bit on the fence about it. And lets be honest, you are not going out of your way to watch animated films for yourself as there are much more entertaining films for adults in the world.","Ferdinand",5946,3.1,-1.9
"5947",3,"  It's a kids movie that has nice characters and a story of difference being a strength when we work together. Being true to yourself is what makes you successful and who wouldn't want their children to leave with that thought.","Ferdinand",5947,3.1,0.1
"5948",5,"  Best animation of the year. Not a new story but one with real heart. Many will overlook this sweet story that has a wonderful message especially in this challenging time.A real winner!","Ferdinand",5948,3.1,-1.9
"5949",4,"  A sweet and very underrated that should be watched with the whole family.","Ferdinand",5949,3.1,-0.9

"5952",0.5,"  I could have written a better movie. A mindless way to screw up a time honored classic story...,","Ferdinand",5952,3.1,2.6
"5953",3,"  First movie of 2018. It was pretty good. Now I have to go find the old cartoon from my childhood.","Ferdinand",5953,3.1,0.1
"5954",3.5,"  Certainly not the ""quickest"" animated feature, this still carries a barn load of sweetness and carries some of the most beautiful scenery work I've seen in animation. Carried a distinctly European feel, set in Spain, so that makes sense!","Ferdinand",5954,3.1,-0.4
"5955",4,"  its a fun movie to watch with the famliy","Ferdinand",5955,3.1,-0.9
"5956",4.5,"  Great family movie. So many applicable life lessons while remaining entertaining. My daughter loved this as much as I did. Can't to see it again with my son. Just wish there were more Hispanic voices in the lead roles.","Ferdinand",5956,3.1,-1.4
"5957",3,"  I watched it once at the cinema last month, and found it un-BULL-ievable.There were moments that I didn't quite expect, including plenty of funny and enjoyable moments. But really, I kind of find it too sad and awkward for teenagers. So what I'm saying is that it's good but not great. If you're planning on watching Ferdinand, don't expect it to be an awesome type of film.","Ferdinand",5957,3.1,0.1
"5958",3,"  I don't really like bulls that are gentle, melancholy, and nonchalant. He's fat, too, and probably not a strong animal. The horses played by Germans and the skinny, prestigious, strict, fancy, little bull seeker El Primero made the show worth something, to me.","Ferdinand",5958,3.1,0.1
"5959",4,"  Great Movie. Very enjoyable. Walked away with a huge smile on my face","Ferdinand",5959,3.1,-0.9

"5963",3,"  not sure why the user score is so low, it was pretty good. John Cena was a miscast.","Ferdinand",5963,3.1,0.1
"5964",5,"  I loved Ferdinand, a story about swimming against the current and refusing to be forced into behaving against his values.I am sure the meat industry will try to out this movie but it speaks volumes of truth, love and inner strength!!This movie is done with a lot of humor and cleverness!!","Ferdinand",5964,3.1,-1.9
"5965",2,"  it was ok, started out good and had its share of funny moments but ultimately turned into a lib-tard shit show pushing liberal agenda.","Ferdinand",5965,3.1,1.1
"5966",0.5,"  Really is not the film that will make you reflect, the environments aren't so realistic like other animated films and is a basic and boring story","Ferdinand",5966,3.1,2.6
"5967",2,"  I remember reading ""The Story of Ferdinand"" when I was a kid and enjoying it. Me remembering the story which is the basis for this movie (And also having a free pass and a coupon for a free popcorn.) motivated me to see this movie. While it is tough to expand a short children's book into a full length movie, I found myself not all that impressed with this movie. It is not terrible by any means, but it is just dull, formulaic and for the most part forgettable. The whole scene of Ferdinand and the bulls escaping in the trailer was recycled right out of ""Finding Dory"". There were also come comedic moments that were just as unoriginal. There are a few laughs here and there, but overall ""Ferdinand"" is just another by the numbers animated film. Unlike Pixar's ""Coco"" there is nothing here that makes this movie unique.","Ferdinand",5967,3.1,1.1
"5968",3,"  Ferdinand was a decent movie, 2017 hasn't been a good year for animated movies, some movies were great like Cars 3, the Lego Batman movie etc, but there have been some bad ones like the Star and the Emoji Movie, but there were some movies that were just decent, and Ferdinand is one of those movies. Created by the same people who worked on movies like Ice Age, Rio and the 2015 Peanuts Charlie Brown movie being the studio Blue Sky, Ferdinand is what I consider one of their more mature movies seeing as it isn't another Ice Age sequel, although it isn't as mature as the Peanuts movie, but I would say this movie is more mature than any of Blue Sky's other movies.This movie has a decent story but it can be predictable at times, the cast is pretty good, the characters are somewhat likable, the music is pretty good, the animation is great, but unfortunately none of the jokes were funny.I'd say this movie falls under the category of it had good potential but it didn't live up to what it should've been, would I recommend this? Well, yes and no, it really depends on if you're interested in watching it, if you are than I'd say give it at least one viewing to make up your mind, but if you're not than it's okay to skip this one.I give Ferdinand a 6 out of 10 it could've been great, but it fell flat on its face.","Ferdinand",5968,3.1,0.1

"5972",5,"  deffo worth watching for everyone","Ferdinand",5972,3.1,-1.9
"5973",4.5,"  Absolutely lovely. A great story that stays true to the message of the book. So many classics have been made into mediocre movies, but this one really stood up. I'm amazed the audience score is so low. I highly recommend this movie for children of all ages.","Ferdinand",5973,3.1,-1.4

"5975",5,"  Loved it! Haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Also made me want to visit Spain.","Ferdinand",5975,3.1,-1.9
"5976",1.5,"  Blue Sky Animation is the home of the truly mediocre in modern animation. The house that the awful Ice Age movies built is back again and apparently attempting to hide their latest bit of sub-par animation by opening Ferdinand opposite Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Smart move, Blue Sky. Burying Ferdinand is definitely the right call. No, the movie isn't terrible, it's just mediocre. And in a world where Pixar still rules, it's not a bad idea to drop your more modestly ambitious products where few audiences will see it. https://geeks.media/movie-review-ferdinand?_ga=2.260866509.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710","Ferdinand",5976,3.1,1.6
"5977",0.5,"  Ferdinand was a waste of time. The only moment of it I enjoyed was the bull/goat/horse dance battle. It is unrealistic and too intense for younger kids. Not intense enough for PG13, but too intense for regular PG. I recommend finding another movie to watch. Ferdinand is too much.","Ferdinand",5977,3.1,2.6

"5980",3,"  This movie is cheesy, but fun. It is a kids movie primarily and it shows. Decent film overall, the mannerisms of the animals is captured well by the animators. Perfect for a fun casual family movie that has it's moments.","Ferdinand",5980,3.1,0.1
"5981",4,"  Saw it tonight with our young daughters (6 and 10) and we all thought it was super cute!! Two thumbs up I felt compelled to leave a review because it's usually the critics who get it wrong, but this time it's the audience rating here which is very low and I disagree with it. Some of the negative reviews seemed somewhat suspect, so I chose to ignore them and glad we did. Also, this is a good kid movie for kids of all ages and for that reason, it trumps Coco (which I really liked but it was somewhat scary to my 6 yr old). Enjoy the movie!","Ferdinand",5981,3.1,-0.9
"5982",5,"  great film for kids better than coco","Ferdinand",5982,3.1,-1.9
"5983",4.5,"  Clash of the titanic bulls overcome by gentle kindness. A tale of adventure and hilarity... especially the equine dancefight.","Ferdinand",5983,3.1,-1.4
"5984",3,"  Taking an 80 year old Children's book that can be read in 5 minutes and expanding it into an hour and 40 minutes is no easy feat. Ferdinand delivers with something for viewers of every age. With an unexpected ending that makes you want to both laugh and cry, this movie does not disappoint. The run time is a little long for the younger set (kids 3 and under) and the use of the word ""butt"" is rampant throughout the picture, ""but"" overall...a great little family film.","Ferdinand",5984,3.1,0.1
"5985",5,"  I loved it. My daughter's loved it. We will see it again.","Ferdinand",5985,3.1,-1.9

"5993",2.5,"  Took my 3 yo to see it, and 3/4 way through she said she did not like this movie. I found it hard to stick with young audiences. Most parents I spoke too who took their kids there did not like it. It was alright in my opinion, nothing great.","Ferdinand",5993,3.1,0.6
"5994",3,"  An animated film with a message that sometimes gets lost in the cartoon silliness.","Ferdinand",5994,3.1,0.1
"5995",3.5,"  It's decent. Nothing great, nothing bad. There is a lot of filler, especially in the first half of the movie, but the second half is exciting and funny. It's not a movie that is really trying to speak to adults and doesn't have much depth. There are many bland characters but some are memorable as well. Even though the main character Ferdinand and the little girl Nina are a little bland, the friendship bond between them feels believeable. Most of the comedy comes from the animation and the pacing and it works well enough for some parts while other scenes just drag. One part that really annoyed me were the constant butt jokes in the first half of the movie but they (fortunately) stopped making those in the second half. The plot is predictable for the most parts but there are little twists at some point. If you know the book the movie is based on, you realize that the writers were trying to expand on the original story and it mostly works. There are also some little scenes that got unexpectly dark. The message doesn't feel forced and the narrative improves as the film goes on. The animation looks good for the most part except for inconsistency in the character designs. Some of the characters are trying to look very realistic (some of the bulls, some of the humans, the horses) while others are way too cartoony and don't blend well with the other characters (the other bulls, the hedgehogs, the goat, the bunny...). The soundtrack is a mix between some generic pop songs and some spanish music which can be a little distracting sometimes. Spanish culture is decently portrayed even though it relies a little bit too much on stereotypes - but there's nothing offensive about it.In conclusion: Ferdinand doesn't really do anything groundbreaking and it is surely not the childrens movie of the year but you can tell that the producers were not trying to accomplish that. Their main goal was just to make some children laugh and they really reached that goal. So despite some stupid moments and some bad jokes, Ferdinand is a enjoyable adventure for the whole family.","Ferdinand",5995,3.1,-0.4
"5996",4.5,"  I and my family loved Ferdinand. My grandson was enamored with it. It is about a bull who doesn't want to fight. However, his pacifistic nature eventually wins out and provides great moral values to the other more violent bulls but also to the audience. Honestly, for kids, this is a great must see movie. Don't believe the negative reviews. It really was very good for kids and we adults liked it too.","Ferdinand",5996,3.1,-1.4

"5998",4,"  Very funny charming film","Ferdinand",5998,3.1,-0.9
"5999",5,"  Excellent development of the short shot made many decades ago. I consider myself lucky to have seen it, after having seen the frst one in the 80's. A wonderful tribute of how to avoid being a bully when everyone goads you to it, in this day and age, this is a rare discourse. Quite creative especially in its denouement, hilarious in many ways, great fun... and I can't wait opionions from the spaniards too. Have seen it with my whole family and children (4 and 11) - the younger one was somewhat discomforted at some more tense moments, but otherwise I recommend it as parent as must see. It's beautiful, hilarious, and educational. As stories should be.","Ferdinand",5999,3.1,-1.9

"6001",1.5,"  God was this hard to get through. Not a bad message, but a cliched one. That's the biggest takeaway. It was cliched slop that wasn't funny and not imaginative. Not impressed and it felt like a straight to DVD film. Skip it.3/10E","Ferdinand",6001,3.1,1.6
"6002",3,"  John Cena charms as the gentle giant who prefers to stop and smell the flowers versus fighting and Kate McKinnon steals the show as Lupe, the calming goat. The film can't compete with the emotional resonance or technical achievement of Disney / Pixar's COCO, but the sweet story and timeless message of ""being who you were born to be"" makes this animated adventure worth the trip.","Ferdinand",6002,3.1,0.1
"6003",4.5,"  Really enjoyed this. The goat makes the film. Lots of laughing out loud. Would recommend","Ferdinand",6003,3.1,-1.4
"6004",3.5,"  A movie that does what it needs to do so you can enjoy it. Took my six year old nephew, have read him the book many times over the year. He really enjoyed it. The dance off scene between the horses and the bulls had him jumping and jamming along with the action on the screen.  There is nothing earth shattering about this movie but it hits enough boxes to explain why decades after it was published the story is still being enjoyed by young and old both.","Ferdinand",6004,3.1,-0.4
"6005",3,"  My three year old loved it! I thought the opening was slow, but things picked up with plenty of cute laughs and a hilarious voice performance by Kate McKinnon.","Ferdinand",6005,3.1,0.1

"6008",5,"  I love movies based on books. However I understand that making a children's book into a movie can be very hard. But personally this is the movie for me and it looks really good. I would rather see a bull smell flowers rather than Jedis cutting Droids for 2 hours.","Ferdinand",6008,3.1,-1.9

"6011",4.5,"  A very fun and emotional movie. The plot was simple and yet it was still fun to see. Funny moments have their own place here and other serious ones too. The movie is exactly what I expected from the trailer. The movie shows that bullfighting isn't a right thing to do. In verdict, the movie is adorable, hilarious, and serious in it's own times","Ferdinand",6011,3.1,-1.4
"6012",5,"  Great story with lots of heart. Fun to watch!","Ferdinand",6012,3.1,-1.9
"6013",5,"  A absolutely hilarious but simultaneously heart-warming story of a bull born in a fighting ranch but who doesn't want to fight.

"6020",3,"  Wasn't the same magic as the book but decent film.","Ferdinand",6020,3.1,0.1
"6021",2,"  I have to say, releasing your movie on the same weekend as the new Star Wars takes guts. It doesn't seem to take being a good movie, however, because Ferdinand isn't that good of a movie.For what it's worth, Ferdinand isn't a horrible movie. At the very least, it has a positive message to put out. The only complain I have against the animation is that the animals often look too human and the humans don't look human enough. Other than that, the animation holds up pretty well against other animated movies. The sound also stacks up well, but it sometimes falters. Inexplicably, the movie can lose its sense of audio balance. Dialogue or music can occasionally have too soft volume. Unfortunately for the movie, this happens at the worst possible moment: the climax, killing any emotional impact it could have had. The climax also suffers from a poor choice in soundtrack, which does not match the mood of the scene at all.Maybe Coco has spoiled me, but I was disappointed that a movie that portrays Spanish culture features almost no Hispanic actors in its main cast. There's not much cultural authenticity in this movie at all. In fact, for a movie that's all about defying stereotypes, it sure does feature a lot of benign stereotypes, notably David Tennant's (Doctor Who) Scottish bull. While I definitely would not call The Last Jedi a kids' movie, it probably is the better choice for kids right now.","Ferdinand",6021,3.1,1.1
"6022",2.5,"  Grade: BRating: PG, 1 hour 46 minutesIn a Nutshell: I lived in Spain for a couple of years in my 20's, so I was curious to see Blue Sky Studio and 20th Century Fox would represent that beautiful country I fell in love with. I especially wanted to see how they would make what is normally a very brutal ""sport"" into a kid-friendly movie! I attended one bull fight in Spain. Once was enough. The truth is that bulls in the ring die a bloody, violent death. Does that sound like a kid movie to you?Honestly, I couldn't decide how I felt about this movie. The animation is colorful and sweet, but the backdrop for the entire story seems almost inappropriate for kids.Uplifting theme: We all have different dreams. Live yours.Control your fears.Flowers make the world a better place!Hate vs. love.Pets are family.Things I liked:Beautiful animation scenery and landscapes. Detailed animation brings richness to straw, dirt, water, chipped paint, and moisture on the bulls' nostrils. Based on The Story of Ferdinand , the original Disney short was first shown in 1938 and even won an Academy Award for Best Short! I thought it was funny when Ferdinand accidentally breathed in a caterpillar and then snorted out a fully-grown butterfly. Ha haThe film introduces kids to a few Spanish traditions which make the country unique and magical, such as flamenco dance, the flower festival (Feria de las flores), and white-washed streets lined with baskets of flowers. I liked it when they showed the old-fashioned, classic windmills of Spain and then the modernized windmills to contrast the rich tradition with the new Spain. It doesn't quite do for Spain what the movie Coco does for Mexico, but it was a nice start.Bull in a china shop. It had to be done.John Cena does a great job as the voice of Ferdinand.The dance battle scene was pretty cute.I never knew there was such a thing as a ""calming goat"" used around bulls. Kate McKinnon is a fantastic comedic actress, really bringing life to Lupe, the goofy goat.The Austrian horses may seem out of place in the movie, but the Lipizzaner show horses are actually really famous in Spain.Segways. Man, I love those. So much fun.It's amazing that they could build an entire feature film around a very short story.Nick Jonas' song Home has been nominated for a Golden Globe. The Ferdinand (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is sweet enough.Things I didn't like:It's not super funny with lots of quick laughs. The audience I watched the movie with was pretty quiet and didn't react much to what was happening on the screen.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles, but nothing important is said that would make those lines crucial to the story. They're just added in to enhance the flavor of Spain. The names of some of the characters are words in Spanish: Guapo (Handsome) and Valiente (Brave). The chase scene went from entertaining to completely ridiculous in about 2 seconds.Some movie critics complain that there are too many characters in this movie, but I didn't mind. Three great actors voiced the hedgehogs, yet I didn't even notice: Gina Rodriguez (I love her in Jane the VIRGIN), Gabriel Iglesias, and Daveed Diggs. They don't get that many lines, and you pay more attention to their antics than to their voices.Funny lines:""I've fallen and I can't giddy-up!"" - Austrian horse""I'm Una! I'm Dos! I'm Cuatro!"" - Hedgehogs""What happened to Tres?"" - Ferdinand""We do not speak of Tres."" - HedgehogsInteresting lines:""Why does not wanting to fight mean I'm scared?"" - Ferdinand (Great question! It often takes greater courage NOT to fight!)""If we don't look out for each other, who will?"" - FerdinandTips for parents: If your kids are sensitive to the horrors of killing animals for sport, this is not the movie for them. There is also a disgusting ""chop house"" scene that might turn your kids into vegans.It's a fairly long animation, and I noticed some of the younger children in the audience I sat with getting bored and fidgety.There is a scene where some characters sing and dance the ""Macarena."" Wow, young kids are definitely not going to know what that dance craze was. That was a LONG time ago!Your kids are probably going to want a pet hedgehog now. They may be shocked to learn that the adorable, little creatures don't come in pink and blue.There is sort of a gay undertone in that bulls are supposed to be manly and macho, yet Ferdinand just wants to play with flowers. In a trailer interview with wrestler-turned-actor John Cena, he explains that he can relate to Ferdinand and being judged, saying, ""Don't judge a bull by its cover."" Always a good lesson for your kids to learn. @trinaboice","Ferdinand",6022,3.1,0.6
"6023",2.5,"  There are plenty of animated films that follow the same sort of formula, make the kids laugh with silly humor but keep the adults entertained by throwing in a heartfelt message that resonates well with people of all ages. Ferdinand certainly tries to do just that with the story of an outsider just wanting to break the mold of being a tough fighter bull, but it also falls victim to the same sort of problems that most non-Disney/Pixar films do.It's always so easy to tell the difference between an animated film that is for all ages and one that is merely made for kids dragging their parents to the theater, and it has nothing to do with the animation style difference between studios. The real difference is in the humor and direction. Ferdinand is full of great voice talent from the improving John Cen, to Kate McKinnon, Daveed Diggs, or Gina Rodriguez. Heck it's even impressive in the look of Blue Sky's animation. However, I had a real issue with the use of that particular voice talent and animation that made the experience far from a worthy outing at the movies.When 98% of the humor is physical-slapstick cheap humor that has no substance or bearing on the actual story, then I constantly get the feeling there wasn't as much time or care put forth in the making of the film than there should be. Which in turn, can eliminate any emotion you did have attached with those particular characters in the first place if the film puts humor before heart.With that said, of course there are things to like about Ferdinand. There will always be place in Hollywood for stories about characters breaking the mold and doing something different, whether that be a human, animal, or even toy. Underneath all of the ridiculous humor, there is a nice arc for the character of Ferdinand and his various animal friends. To me though, the misplaced childish humor every few minutes interrupts any momentum for the real story to kick in.5.7/10","Ferdinand",6023,3.1,0.6

"6029",5,"  Its sad that some trolls are trying to give negative ratings to this movie without even watching it. I saw the audience score, it was 77%, then it went to 56%, then 65% and then again to 57%.This movie was very heart warming and I really liked it. I never thought that ever in my life I would think that an animated bull would be the cutest character ever. 1st and 3rd acts were great, 2nd act which was the middle portion was hit and miss, but for some reason every time the horses were on the screen, I couldn't help but smile because of their accent and dialog. Overall a really Good movie.","Ferdinand",6029,3.1,-1.9

This becomes pretty clear when you read the real reviews here from people who've seen the film and most rate it positive. Yet you look at the score and it's negative! Little punks who do this and think it's funny need to get a damn life!

"6038",3,"  A mildly amusing flick. I went to see it with a four, 6, and seven year old.The four year old asked ""Why did he do that?"" for almost every scene, he couldn't follow the character motivations, but laughed at the 3 minutes of slapstick pratfalls every ten minutes. The six year old started whining ""I'm bored, can we go home now?"" after 15 minutes and kept it up non-stop till the end. The seven year old enjoyed the whole thing. Seven to ten year olds wil probably be the best audience. For adults, the movie was VERY PC. Anti- bullfighting (more of a european issue), anti-meat (we watch the bulls escape in terror from a meat- packing plant). Tons of general anti- violence messages. Tons of butterflies and flowers. And quite a few flowery characters. Watchable, but would have flowed much better if it were 30 minutes shorter.","Ferdinand",6038,3.1,0.1
"6039",3.5,"  Love the story as I've always loved the book - Kate McKinnon's goat is hilarious. John Cena's Ferdinand is honest. All that said it is clear this is a ""B"" level studio effort - especially on animation and scoring.","Ferdinand",6039,3.1,-0.4

"6041",5,"  Ferdinand is one of the most entertaining, highly excellent and laugh out movies I've ever watched in the world. The movie Ferdinand has a lot of messages behind its story and I find them ... you know, great and a worth-remembering sort of thing. This movie touched my heart the moment I watched it, and it was rare because it had never happened to me, before, and this film deserves to be remembered for a long time. Its less expected funny moments, the story original enough to put a smile on my face, the bonds of immense friendships, thrilling adventures & an unbreakable love between a loving, little girl and a tough, gentle bull who loves sniffing flowers.This film is perfect for all families of the young and the old out there, so come to Hoyts and enjoy the adventure!

"6059",4,"  John Cena is a fighting bull and a fighting champ!!!Ferdinand is an animation about a bull who doesn't fight, who loves flowers, who wants his own freedom. John Cena casted as Ferdinand, the nice bull, did pretty well voicing a main character. The story is written well, depicting the livelihood of the animals which taken place in Spain, it may have misses some things which some of the audience might catch on but it's strong in the admiration of the characters, the inspiration by all traits of Ferdinand and his farm friends. See Ferdinand, you might have some fun with it.","Ferdinand",6059,3.1,-0.9
"6060",2,"  Unfortunately, 20th Century Fox once again did not learn their lesson to release juvenile crap on the same day Star Wars hits theaters. They got awfully owned by the way better Force Awakens when it came to that Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. Ferdinand, on the other hand, attempts to become way better than Fox's latest attempt to bring the chipmunks back to theaters but that doesn't mean that Ferdinand is a second option to send children or basically the whole family just in case they have already seen the latest Star Wars movie. I just wish 20th Century Fox would just stop releasing movies like these on the same day as Star Wars gets released to theaters unless they can bring a way better movie that isn't juvenile like their latest attempts yet. Literally worth the shot once it becomes able for rent but don't expect to find anything that can hold this movie back from its score.","Ferdinand",6060,3.1,1.1

"6075",5,"  God is not dead! Despite those in Hollywood who want to poke fun at believers , or call them crazy. God is still performing miracles in peoples lives and he needs to be brought back into schools. Kids being raised without God is one of the biggest calamities of the 21 st century. And it is quite evident in some of the tragedies occurring in our schools today. There are some hurting children out there who are acting out in some horrific ways. Some schools are pushing to have the 10 commandments back in the schools. Thank God for movies like this!","Gods not Dead",6075,1.4,-3.6
"6076",5,"  I dont care what the critics say. There not directing the movies to white christians and all the other bull. Its like they all missed the moral of the story which is that belielf in god is your choice and no one should have a say in your belief. No matter your Race! The Movies point out that god (any god you belive in cause even people who aren't Christian or Catholic can relate to the hate and hurt shown in this movie) will give you a life full of challenges but u hold to strength belief and hope you can overcome anything but if its your tine to go then go in peace with whatever you hold dear. Change the word god to any other belief and these critics will have the same ideal. But if you change the word god to what you believe in and what the christian god has done for his followers to what your belief does for your followers then is the movie not sending the same message.

"6081",3.5,"  ""God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness"" (PG, 2:00), also referred to as ""God's Not Dead 3"", is the third movie in the GND franchise, but the series is... evolving. 2014's ""God's Not Dead"" was mainly about attempting to prove God's existence academically (in a series of debates between a college student and his atheist professor). 2016's ""God's Not Dead 2"" tried to prove it in a courtroom, within the context of a plot that was more involved (but ridiculously unrealistic). This third GND film goes even further into concentrating on story development and abandons any attempt to prove God's existence through facts and logic. In this one, the director and writer of the first two are replaced by writer-director Michael Mason. It's Mason's first feature in any capacity, but his efforts give us the best executed GND yet.The film picks up immediately following the post-credits scene in ""2"" in which Reverend David Hill (David A.R. White) is arrested for refusing a court order to turn over transcripts of his sermons. David's brief incarceration is fodder for news and talk shows, carrying forward the GND narrative that Christianity is under siege in modern America. David's church has become a source of political and social division in this small-town Arkansas community - and for the (fictional) college on whose land the church stands.When a female coed named Keaton (Samantha Boscarino) breaks up with her boyfriend, Adam (Mike C. Manning), over religious differences, Adam takes out his frustrations by throwing a brick through a window of David's church. That single impulsive act has unintended but serious consequences which give the college an excuse to offer David a check to buy the building - and to use an eminent domain claim to try to force him to accept. This sets up a battle royale (legal and otherwise) between the pastor and one of his best friends, Hadleigh University chancellor Thomas Ellsworth (Ted McGinley). David gets his estranged brother, Pearce (John Corbett), to take a reluctant break from his Chicago law practice and come down to Arkansas to help. But in spite of all the help David gets from his irreligious brother, and the support he gets from his new girlfriend (Jennifer Taylor), he wonders why he hasn't heard from God.""God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness"" is more enjoyable, more relatable and more relevant than the previous GND movies. This one isn't nearly as preachy as the others (not even allowing anyone a comforting ""He's with Jesus now"" when a main character dies), settling for trying to prove God's not dead by showing how alive he is in the lives of his followers. In doing so, Mason puts forth a story that is dramatic and accessible enough for a broader audience to appreciate - including well-written dialog and excellent acting. In the end, the film's point of view is very clear, along with an even more wide-ranging message about the need for listening over talking, unity over divisiveness and love over hate.

"6086",4,"  I was pleasantly surprised after the rather mediocre victim mentality focus of God's Not Dead 2. I think they redeemed themselves with this story and the focus on love and unity after Jesus Christ's teaching. It touched on the devisions of the world between beleivers and nonbelievers and perspectives from both that showed we as humans are deeply flawed and our understanding or ignorance comes more from the core sensibilities of our heart and soul rather that the religion we ascribe to. Overall I liked this God's Not Dead 3 movie the best, the first one was pretty good as Well and if you have interest in the speculative questions between faith in God or beleif in happenstance it broached these questions sensibly.","Gods not Dead",6086,1.4,-2.6

"6103",5,"  I always laugh at the critics. They so predictably hate Christian movies.We LOVED this movie. It's well written, well acted, and it's challenging as a Christian. If you're not a believer I still really recohmmend it because it shows our himan side and how just because were Christian's doesn't mean we don't have questions or that we don't struggle to act like Jesus when things get hard.It's a great movie.","Gods not Dead",6103,1.4,-3.6

"6106",2.5,"  Not near as good as original. Original was debate between prof & student over existence of God. This one gets into geo-political conflict over a church on college campus & whether it can be removed legally or strong-armed.","Gods not Dead",6106,1.4,-1.1

"6112",3.5,"  Very entertaining sequel to the 1995 classic. Upgrading the board game to a video game turns out to be a good move and the concept of putting the real life characters into the bodies of their very different avatars brings along some good laughs. On top of that, all lead actors (with a special mention for Jack Black) bring their A-game, making this a fun, adventurous watch.","Jumanji",6112,3.1,-0.4
"6113",3.5,"  The movie was pretty entertaining. Jack Black wasn't annoying for once and was actually hilarious. However I wouldn't really call this Jumanji.. It was hardly related to the original movie besides the board game at the start and the title of the movie. Other than that it's just a movie where they get sucked into a video game.... but still a good watch","Jumanji",6113,3.1,-0.4
"6114",4.5,"  Clever script with superb casting. It is hard to be quite as vested as in some other types of adventures because we ""know"" this is a game ... until we forget! Great fun.","Jumanji",6114,3.1,-1.4
"6115",5,"  Way better than the 1st film.","Jumanji",6115,3.1,-1.9
"6116",2.5,"  Loved the original so much that I thought this was a joke when I saw the preview, but ended up going to see it and it was much better than I thought it would be. Lots of laughs too.","Jumanji",6116,3.1,0.6
"6117",3,"  This movie was ok, but not as good as people were making it seem. I enjoyed it for the most part but don't really see myself taking the time to watch it again.","Jumanji",6117,3.1,0.1
"6118",3,"  ok not great The original was much better.","Jumanji",6118,3.1,0.1
"6119",4.5,"  The Rock plays very well with Kevin Hart. Laughs throughout the movie.","Jumanji",6119,3.1,-1.4
"6120",4,"  Far better than I expected. If you enjoyed the Robin Williams original, and you are not totally annoyed by everything that Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson does, then give this a shot. If you have kids, this is one of those essential passing the torch moments. Highly recommend in Blu-ray too.","Jumanji",6120,3.1,-0.9
"6121",3.5,"  If there is anything that the original ""Jumanji"" had that made it special, besides Robin Williams, is that the creatures were largely menacing and the mystery about how dangerous ""The Jungle"" of the game might be was a palpable thought. The fact that thar world doesn't feel vicious enough and they barely explore it is disappointing. BUT this updated follow-up is good fun on its own with a clever cast & solid entertainment! - 7/10","Jumanji",6121,3.1,-0.4
"6122",1.5,"  Welcome to the jungle...really? Is that the best they could come up with? How many movies have used that in one way or another now?So at the end of the first movie (in 1969) the board game Jumanji was thrown into a river by Alan Parrish; 26 years later (1995) its somehow ended up in France apparently. Fast forward to 1996 and the board game has once again been discovered...but back in America? (I trust that wasn't supposed to be the same beach from the first movie). Anyway the game has somehow evolved with the times and is now a videogame console; and once again it lures another unsuspecting youth into its jungle themed clutches. Fast forward again to 2016 and four students will also discover the board game which will trigger the same things that happened before. And round and round we go.So I gotta admit that I liked the idea that this mysterious game can somehow evolve with the times. Back in the first movie (1969) it was a board game to blend in with the era. Now its a videogame console which of course is perfect for this era. The whole idea of the protagonists choosing a game avatar to play as which then turns out to be their live action avatar once inside the game is pretty cool (although [i]Red Dwarf[/i] did it first). This does inevitably lead to very stereotypical characters which is deliberate...but doesn't excuse the stereotypical teenage protagonists which wasn't deliberate I'm guessing.Yeah so the teenagers, they're a straight 'Breakfast Club' type bunch for sure. You've got the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the weirdo. So yeah its a complete rip-off. I really felt like they could of done better with these characters despite the movie being full of deliberate cliches and stereotypes. As for the avatars they are also rather cliche, naturally. The Rock is of course just playing the same character he always does, basically himself. Jack Black is the squat, spectacled, old fashioned looking professor type. Kevin Hart is the goofy sidekick type. And Karen Gillian is Lara Croft essentially.One thing that did get me thinking was the in-game characters, the baddies and the in-game guide. The in-game guide and various baddie henchmen all seemed to act like actual videogame characters on rails. In other words they don't interact with the protagonists on a personal level, they just do and say what they were programmed. But some henchmen and the main villain (Bobby Cannavale as Professor Van Pelt, same name as the big game hunter from the first movie) seemed to not do this. It did seem like Van Pelt behaved differently and not in a programmed way like the others, almost as if he were a real person. Now in the original movie we never saw the jungle in the game, obviously this time we do. Alas its not really been visualised that well in my opinion. I always had the impression the jungle was set in an old fashioned British colonial type era mixed with a bit of [i]Tarzan[/i] type fantasy. Like the exterior of the board game indicates. Of course as the game evolved so did the interior jungle it seems. This unfortunately has led to all sorts of modern crap turning up like military choppers, motorbikes, modern guns and weapons, ridiculous chase sequences, and lots of explosions. Now I'm sure some people will have liked these elements but for me it totally ruined the entire feel of the movie, or at least the look and feel I was hoping for.Gone is the possibility of quaintness and charm, enter vast CGI chase sequences on-board a military chopper (being chased by man eating CGI rhinos. Why didn't they just shoot them?). Stupid chase sequences with hordes of motorbike riding bad guys. Lots of gunfire, explosions and of course the obligatory martial arts sequences from Ruby Roundhouse. I might add that Ruby Roundhouse spends lots of time trying to learn how to flirt and act sexy to distract some bad guys, but ends up just kicking the crap out of them. Her entire character is utterly pointless, why did we need all that shit when she can just beat them up. Its like one sequence where The Rock's character says he knows CPR but doesn't actually do it when its required. He just stands there and gives instructions to another character, eh??Its really such a shame that this movie went down the route it did. Obviously there was gonna be CGI involved, obviously there was gonna be greenscreen involved, but Jesus Christ could they not do any better than this?! Most of the CGI is bad, real bad. Most of the greenscreen is obvious, real obvious. In fact it gets noticeably worse towards the end in my opinion. There are barely any practical effects which the first movie did incorporate in places. This movie is just ugly from top to bottom and its not helped by all the ludicrous action sequences. Its like half the movie wants to be like [i]The Phantom[/i], and the other half like [i]Rambo[/i]. Its such a clash of genres and tone.There is also a large plot hole in the way this story works, I think, unless I missed something. In the original Alan Parrish goes back to the point where he started playing the game in 1969 and changes time. This is obviously meant that Judith and Peter would never have played (in 1995) and wouldn't know anything about the game or Alan (having never met him). In this new movie the protagonists meet up with the kid (Alex) who got trapped in the game from 1996. When they all leave Alex goes back to the point he started playing in 1996 and changes time. So if he changed time, how come the four main protagonists still remember everything when they get back to their present day of 2016? Surely there's a chance they would never have ended up playing the game, or the game wouldn't have ended up in the school (?).Anyway once again I find myself completely mystified by a modern movies success. How on earth did this pile of crap make so much money? How on earth did people find this enjoyable?? I could maybe understand it if this was an original movie and the first had never existed, but it does exist! I simply cannot fathom how anyone can accept this utter garbage after the excellent original movie (complete with a terrific Robin Williams) which came out back in 1995. There are some neat little touches here and there, I like the evolution and mystery of the game, and Jack Black is always a pleasure. But apart from that, this was yet another cookie cutter Dwayne Johnson flick. CGI laden trash of the highest order.","Jumanji",6122,3.1,1.6
"6123",3.5,"  movie was a lot better then expected. I saw the first jumanji movie when I was little and when I first heard about this and what the story was I thought It was going to ruin the jumanji name but after seeing it I am very much mistaken. I'm am still unsure about the board just randomly turning into a console game but still great story and funny. And I'm happy that they fitted in a robin Williams reference in the film.","Jumanji",6123,3.1,-0.4
"6124",0.5,"  worst acting job I've ever seen in my life are people going to hell there's so much homosexuality in there how did you guys make this right for a kids watch nowadays guys are all fucked up in the head hands down gayest movie I've ever seen","Jumanji",6124,3.1,2.6
"6125",1.5,"  This is one of the worst widescreen releases that I have ever seen. Thank the heavens that I didn't pay for it! The new JUMANJI has everything imaginable wrong with it. The environment has zero plausibility, there is no innovative creativeness, the characters are inane, and nearly all attempts to be funny are shamefully cartoonish. Practically no effort is put into generating special-effects that are warranted for blockbuster fantasy adventure and any concept (or quote) that had the slightest bit of humor to it, was widely broadcasted over the inordinate trailer. For the record, when I was fifteen years old, I absolutely loved the original JUMANJI. It's a disgrace that Hollywood was able to flourish a financial gain from this jejune slab of rubbish.","Jumanji",6125,3.1,1.6

"6133",3,"  Overrated to a point. Still this ""Jumanji"" rehash still offers just enough fun and silliness without much boredom to give it a minor pass. I would beware of those who think this movie is close to the second coming, however.","Jumanji",6133,3.1,0.1

"6135",5,"  A great movie, with a new and improved story and concept (although I think they took a big risk moving away from the original story, like in the first Jumanji movie). Entire cast was great, also, especially with the addition/appearance of K. Gillan, who I've personally never seen before.","Jumanji",6135,3.1,-1.9

"6142",4,"  Really silly, really fun, exactly what you'd expect a movie like this to deliver, a really great update for once with the videogame-style integration, which if you are an action or RPG gamer you would really enjoy as it's very well done.","Jumanji",6142,3.1,-0.9
"6143",2.5,"  While Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle manages to have its own shine and fun moments without exploiting the innevitable nostalgia factor that comes with it, it is also highly forgettable.","Jumanji",6143,3.1,0.6

"6147",4.5,"  Delightful movie, laughed all the way thru this movie.","Jumanji",6147,3.1,-1.4
"6148",2,"  This sequel is a far cry from the original. It's more a comedy flick mixed with teenage drama than an adventure film.","Jumanji",6148,3.1,1.1

"6156",3,"  Set twenty years after Alan Parrish's fateful encounter with the dangerous board game Jumanji, the game has since then evolved into a plug and play video game designed to ensnare new players into playing new games. When four teenagers end up sucked into this new game and transformed into their avatars, they must use their new skills and abilities to win the game and escape Alan's world...Originally planned as a straight-up reboot of the 1994 Robin Williams cult classic, Jumanji, but ended up being retooled as a loose sequel after the tragic passing of Williams in 2014, this more comedic take on Chris Van Allsberg's story of a game coming to life may not always land in it's comedy, but the screenplay's clever knowledge revolving around video game tropes ironically makes this unwanted sequel, a more faithful adaptation, than 3/4% of most video-game film adaptations in the entire industry.Another aspect that makes this film extremely funny is the comedy revolving around the teenagers having to adapt to thier avatar bodies with the biggest laughs coming from a valley girl being reincarnated as a Jack Black Professor or the school sports star being turning into a wimpy Backpack-carrying Kevin Hart. Although these character arcs pale in comparison to Alan's arc in the first film, the actors all have such funny chemistry, that it's hard to compare them to the more serious character arcs of the first film.Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle may lack the intensity, surprises and character development of the 1994 film, but the funnier than expected humour, the impressive use of the video game setting within the screenplay and the solid acting, makes this stand-alone sequel, a game worth replay value...","Jumanji",6156,3.1,0.1

"6165",4,"  I did not expect it to be THIS good. Kevin Hart is hilarious, and Jack Black obviously had tons of fun with his role. Pays beautiful homage to the first one but can totally stand alone as just a great film.","Jumanji",6165,3.1,-0.9
"6166",3,"  It was very entertaining for what it was. I just wished that they had included more from the original movies like lion, huge mosquitoes, and people eating plants. Nothing in the jumanji jungle is unique but it's still a fun story","Jumanji",6166,3.1,0.1
"6167",4,"  Fun and adventurous. While it certainly is not the original, this movie brings the board game to a new generation and did so successfully in my humble opinion.","Jumanji",6167,3.1,-0.9

Its humour was mostly a miss or just kinda-funny, the actors couldn't get their character's right, and we learned nothing new about how game came to be or it's purpose.

Unfortunately it's to late after we spend it with them it and I believe that's what they know. If you have young children and don't want them to see grown men peeing and talking about how it feels and asking for other men to help them you might not want to watch it with them.Most of the movie is all talking very little action","Jumanji",6180,3.1,2.6

"6208",3.5,"  I am pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie. The updated yet old-school video game was cleverly redone but still mimicked the original movie. The characters are Wonderful and Jack Black steals the show. I laughed out loud many times. It is fun to watch with older children. I would not recommend it for younger kids as it does have several curse words and they won't understand it. This movie is fun and I would watch it again.","Jumanji",6208,3.1,-0.4

"6218",2.5,"  When I first heard of this movie, I honestly figured it would be disgustingly bad. Now that it's out, I can see that it's nowhere near as bad as I expected. Still, that doesn't mean I necessarily like it.Jumanji is part of the new trend of disguising remakes as sequels. That, or it's a sequel disguised as a remake. Either way, it stands out from the original Jumanji in some ways and is strikingly similar I other ways. The characters, meanwhile, are more high school and action movie archetypes than characters. That makes it hard to get invested in them or take them seriously, until they get some perfunctory but welcome character development. Then again, taking them seriously isn't really the point. It's supposed to be a mindless fun. At first, I thought all of the camera movements would get in the way of that, but the cinematography hits that sweet spot of showing off the craziness without being nauseous. During the climax, the lighting similarly sets the mood without being so dark that you can't see what's going on.Jumanji's main appeal is seeing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart at work together. Co-staring in last year's Central Intelligence has given the pair good experience to build their chemistry off of. Still, that's not enough to refresh this movie's stale sense of humor. Most of the jokes are based on cliches, dumb, or telegraphed miles in advance. There are quite a few laughs to be had here, but there's no getting around how unfunny large chunks of the movie is, Since that's the core of the movie. Adventure-comedies are perfectly fine, but there are countless movies out there that do it better.","Jumanji",6218,3.1,0.6
"6219",3,"  i thought this was pretty funny movie","Jumanji",6219,3.1,0.1
"6220",2,"  Not too bad,if you?ve nothing else to watch :)","Jumanji",6220,3.1,1.1
"6221",4,"  this was funny; Kevin Hart's character is quite comical. his snarky comments got me good a few times. & Jack Black does such a great job at being stupid, too. i really liked it. i'd definitely watch it again.","Jumanji",6221,3.1,-0.9
"6222",4.5,"  This made me laugh and scream at the action parts. This reboot might not top the original but is a funny and action packed experience for all ages","Jumanji",6222,3.1,-1.4
"6223",4.5,"  i was so surprised at how good this movie was. very enjoyable the whole way through Rock and Hart solid and funny as usual.","Jumanji",6223,3.1,-1.4
"6224",4.5,"  The movie ""Jumanji, welcome to the jungle"" is a 2017 american action comedy film. From a story by Chris McKenna, it's the second movie in the jumanji franchise based on the 1981 children's book. The film starts Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Set twenty-one years after the first film, the plot follows four teenagers who are transported into a video game world called ""Jumanji."" Once the player chooses their character for the game they all get sucked in. Uniting with another they must overcome the games magical power in order to win and return home. In the end, the cast saves the day and wins the game of Jumanji and returns home. The moral of the movie is a band of friends come together by putting aside any differences they have and overcoming the challenges of Jumanji. The new movie had some concerns and seems to some people to be disrespectful because of the original movie starring Robin Williams. People think that due to Robin Williams legacy it's cruel to try to ""remake"" or ""modernize"" the original jumanji movie but the author thought differently, the author made the movie on the amazing and fun idea of the jumanji movie but also in remembrance of Robin Williams. This paper will show specific analysis of the movie that it was not disrespect towards Robin Williams, but rather honored him though character analysis and the specific ideas of the movie. The movie ""jumanji, Welcome To The Jungle"" honors Robin Williams because of the specific ideas of the movie. The first jumanji movie was based on a board game and is a very popular film because of Williams, but the new movie is based on a video game and some people have some speculations as to why. The new movie takes place in the jungle of jumanji and through the movie there were many incidences where they referenced Robin Williams from the original jumanji movie. For example, in the original jumanji movie Robin williams character in the movie (Alan Parrish) was stuck in the jungle just like the characters in the new movie, but while they're there, they find many clues left behind by Williams' Character who was stuck there from the original. This is important because the new Jumanji movie has not overthrown the original and the directors of the movie show that. Through the movie they don't directly reference Williams, but they leave mini easter eggs to show that this movie was not the original. This movie also honors Robin Williams because of the characters who play in the new movie. There are specific examples of the actors from the movie such as Kevin Hart, the Rock, Nick Jonas, and Karen Gillan who testify to reporters that when they were making this movie they did not forget to remember robin williams and the original movie. For example, Kevin hart said that ""We didn't want to do a remake, we're doing more of a continuation and we just wanted to make sure that we do that film proud."" It's almost like the karate kid franchise, there were multiple movies, but when they made the 2010 film there were no arguments made to as if the movie was cruel to the original. This is important because the directors of the movie jumanji weren't just trying to profit from the original but they were trying to step in the light of Robin williams. This film also steps into the light of Robin Williams by giving people something to remember him by through easter eggs in the film. The directors of the movie didn't forget to leave out a small roll that Robin Williams plays even in the new movie. For example, in the film when the four characters are trapped in the jungle of jumanji when jack black and Dwayne Johnson's characters find a jungle house that only could have been built by Robin Williams character, parrish, who was stuck in the jungle for 23 years in the first film. Jack Black also goes on to say that ""We're exploring the jungle and trying to conquer the game; it's life or death. But while were there, we find clues left behind by (Robin Williams's Parrish character). He built a full-blown jungle house, similar to a Swiss Family Robinson situation. It's like he's there helping us without actually being there."" This is important because most people who are against this film go on to say that this movie is almost against Robin Williams because they believed that they were trying to overthrow his legacy when that's the complete opposite of what the directors purposes were. Kenny, a writer from new york times, has a negative remarks for ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"".. For example, ""very few remakes, sequels or franchise reboots have signaled their desperation to connect quite as nakedly as Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle does."" In other words they're trying to cash in on the success of the original jumanji movie from 1995, but threw the evidence of this paper it goes to show that not some, but all the actors and the directors of this film made this movie all under the influence of Robin Williams. For example, dwayne johnson, behind scene says, ""I have such a tremendous amount of love and reverence for the original movie and what Robin meant to my family. I loved it like the world loved it."" In the end, the jumanji movie isn't disrespectful towards Robin Williams because the characters and the specific ideas of the movie prove that wrong. Robin Williams legacy lives on threw quotes, specific examples in the movie, and people. The purpose of this film is only trying to do the original movie proud.","Jumanji",6224,3.1,-1.4
"6225",2,"  ok movie, don't know why one of the jonas was in this movie. they're suppose to be musicians not actors. the movie was boring at times, but it was entertaining none the less.","Jumanji",6225,3.1,1.1
"6226",5,"  I am going to talk about this film. I went to see the film in the cinema 1 month ago. I really like it.It's about 4 people who played a video game called Jumanji. They went into the video game and played it. The game is about life or death. They have many crazy adventures and they were very scared.I love it because the people are very funny and fun. They've got superpowers, for example: one of the people can run very quickly. They've got 3 lives and when they lose it they die. Everyone got weak points.Please see it! It's fantastic!","Jumanji",6226,3.1,-1.9
"6227",4.5,"  With a very endearing cast and humorous storyline, Jumanji has done it again giving fans of the previous movie a satisfied sequel and the new generation a very entertaining family movie. The only thing I wish to criticize is the extremely underdeveloped and un-threatening villain.","Jumanji",6227,3.1,-1.4
"6228",4,"  I loved this movie. What could be better than Jack Black portraying a teenage girl? It is entertaining, funny and worth seeing.","Jumanji",6228,3.1,-0.9
"6229",3,"  not bad for what its worth. The Rock Rules as always","Jumanji",6229,3.1,0.1
"6230",4,"  I loved this movie! Anything with the Rock and Kevin Hart is bound to be a hit, but honestly worth seeing again!","Jumanji",6230,3.1,-0.9
"6231",3,"  5 Points: 1) Cast - 1.0/1.0 2) Storyline/Plot: 0.5/1.03) Soundtrack - 0.5/1.04) Visuals - 0.5/1.0 5) Distinguishing Aspects - 0.5/1.0 Total: 3.0/5.0 Suggested RT Score: 77%","Jumanji",6231,3.1,0.1
"6232",1.5,"  89% of audience enjoyed this??? Really? I must be out of touch with reality or the demographics of the audience have changed. I used to prioritize my viewing based on RT scores and other indicators, but this is yet another example of why I need to change my watching philosophy. The original Jumanji was fun, entertaining, etc. I could not help but think that this movie was primarily targeted for the teen-age crowd with little to entertain anyone over the mental age of 17. I like the actors individually and there were a couple (and only a couple) good lines (mostly delivered by Kevin Hart who was obviously the comic relief character). But the entire premise, execution, and plot was flat and did nothing to pique my interest. It is true that most sequels are poor attempts to capitalize of the popularity of the original, and this lives up to that. My advise: If you are over the mental age of 17, don't bother unless you don't mind plopping down $6 on cable and wasting almost two hours of your life. I'm sorry for the review, but I wish Hollywood (or Japan or China or whoever has bought the movie studios most recently) would focus more on plot, character development, and WRITING over cheap gags and special effects.","Jumanji",6232,3.1,1.6
"6233",3.5,"  3/21/2018The movie took on a whole different narrative from the 90's original but added some clever gaming factors. Overall, not all that original but fun nevertheless.","Jumanji",6233,3.1,-0.4
"6234",4,"  A great movie that embraces the video game aspect. Although some parts are slow and characters slightly have a bad moment or two, these characters really elevate this movie. The only character I think fell flat was Kevin Hart as he was himself. Everyone else played a highschooler which can be felt but Hart felt like the same old Hart. I love Hart but he brings it down slightly and he should have been a bit more ruder. I love the Rock and Jack Black were the best in my opinion, especially Black since he was the funniest and more true to his high school counterpart. Great Movie and the critic review has underestimated this movie.","Jumanji",6234,3.1,-0.9
"6235",3,"  It is not hilarious, but there are some good laughs in this movie. It doesn't take itself seriously, it's just a fun adventure with a great cast. I recommend it.","Jumanji",6235,3.1,0.1
"6236",4,"  It's almost like Breakfast Club and Jumanji had a love child. You've got all the elements, the nerd, the jock, the self-absorbed girl and the socially inept girl. But the simple truth is - Jack Black as a self-absorbed teenage girl was BRILLIANT. He was hysterical.","Jumanji",6236,3.1,-0.9
"6237",3,"  Far more amusing than it has any right to be. Unlike the original, there is more of a sense of imagination on display even if it is ultimately just a goofy action comedy.","Jumanji",6237,3.1,0.1
"6238",4.5,"  Jumanji was a really good film. 8/10","Jumanji",6238,3.1,-1.4
"6239",2.5,"  While the cast, performances and action scenes are passable by modern standards, its let down by its juvenile sense of humour. However, credits where credits is due, the teenagers do feel like real, modern teenagers of the current generation, in contrast with most other teens of this generation. Overall, it feels pandering, so i recommend you skip it","Jumanji",6239,3.1,0.6
"6240",3.5,"  Jack Black stole the show","Jumanji",6240,3.1,-0.4

"6245",2,"  Not a big fan of this film. Here's why:1) Making 'Jumanji' an Atari game was STUPID. Really? The jungle drums wouldn't have enticed 1996 Kid to play the game? It was an 'update' that didn't need to happen and it took away some of the magic of the original film. TOTALLY unnecessary and dopey change that will date the film. Kind of like in ""Hook"" when the lost boys start doing the ""Arsenio Hall"" whoop whoop whoop chant. 2) The original Jumanji was about the real dangers of the jungle of the past (animals, floods, hunters, etc.). This one tried to make things up to date by having humans with motorcycles being the villains. Again, nothing like the original story. I do realize that the film doesn't need to tell the same story again, but the original film had a lot of charm that had to do with it not being set in modern times.3) Language- First, I really don't care if swearing is in a movie. HOWEVER- this movie was clearly aimed at kids. The dopiness of the situation, the game aspect, etc. Why have all the language in there?4) Actors- Kevin Hart can be funny. Jack Black can be funny. But here, the lines were so dumb and it was like the writers said ""Okay, let's roll out the typical Hart/Black schtick - even though real characters wouldn't say this stuff"".Overall, I felt this was put together without a lot of respect for the original and it just comes off as a money grab rather than ""a good story that needed to be told"". I thought Johnson and Gillan were fine in it, for what it was. They did a good job with what they had. Making Jack Black's character a female was dopey and unfunny and felt completely forced. Same with Hart's character. He's always gonna be Kevin Hart.Oh, and I was disappointed that with Rhys Darby in a film, there was no band meeting (Flight of the Conchords reference). ;)","Jumanji",6245,3.1,1.1
"6246",3.5,"  Hilarious! I laughed out loud several times. It was a little draggy through the middle, but generally action packed. I would watch it again.","Jumanji",6246,3.1,-0.4

"6257",4.5,"  Dont know if its an original element because I havn't seen the original movie and I cant remember the tv show but the comedy element to this whole movie is that the four stars in JumanJi 1.The Rock 2.Kev Hart 3.Jack Black 4.Karen Gillan are actually just avators of the 4 school children that entered the game this surprised me but it worked really well. I watched this movie last night and I want to see it again highly recommend. It would be nice to see a sequel even if it meant different actors.","Jumanji",6257,3.1,-1.4

One of the actors who had a brilliant highlight was Nick Jonas, who played Alex, the boy who disappeared and got stuck in the game for twenty years, but who is rescued by his friends afterwards.Jumanji - welcome to the jungle, was a continuation / remake of Jumanji, released in 1995.

It would have been too awful to watch. Thankfully, Hart and Black made this movie great, watchable, and down right HILARIOUS!

"6299",4,"  Consider this: Jack Black's character speaks in a high-pitched, effeminate voice throughout the movie-which prima facie might seem to be because he plays the virtual reality avatar of a teen girl, but once you realize that none of the other characters have the timbre of their voices altered, it means that the girly voice is natural to Black's character. That's a funny joke any way you slice it, and speaks to how cleverly layered this adaptation of Jumanji ultimately is.","Jumanji",6299,3.1,-0.9
"6300",5,"  Awesome film, very hilarious.","Jumanji",6300,3.1,-1.9
"6301",4,"  i laughed so hard when fridge exploded when he ate the cake, fell out of the helicopter, and saying he has a magic backpack, and at the end came out on the elephant yellin' ZOOLOGY B*TCH","Jumanji",6301,3.1,-0.9
"6302",4.5,"  This movie was a great sequel to Jumanji! I was skeptical at first, but my friend wanted to see it, so I went with him. I was surprised after seeing it. It's a fun film and a good sequel!","Jumanji",6302,3.1,-1.4
"6303",3.5,"  A rowdy romp through a jungle adventure that plays well with fun actors, fun writing, and a vibe that gives a nod to the original while feeling fresh and interesting.","Jumanji",6303,3.1,-0.4
"6304",3,"  Not as good as the original.","Jumanji",6304,3.1,0.1
"6305",3.5,"  Jumanji is the 2nd pairing of Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and they don't disappoint. Then throw in Jack Black as a high School debutante and the good times roll.","Jumanji",6305,3.1,-0.4
"6306",2,"  Unnecessary sequel that doesn't understand what made the source appealing, as soon as characters are put in the video game all suspense was lost because it was different characters and they just hamfisted their way through cultural statements. I'm very tired of movies being Ok reboots rather than taking any risk, this movie is set to make 400 million and that's the real tragedy, they're selling the same movie watered down and modernised to make a quick buck and we are so starved for good movies we get excited that they don't ruin it, how low a bar have we made. But hey Jack Black plays a good trans guy so let's give this shit 80%","Jumanji",6306,3.1,1.1
"6307",5,"  Funny and smart twist","Jumanji",6307,3.1,-1.9
"6308",3.5,"  This movie gathers an amazing cast, a really funny script and makes it into something great and magical, a movie where you're going to have a good time, gauranteed. While it's a movie that nobody really asked for, but it's also a movie that you didn't now you needed, and on a side note, the CGI was outstanding, Jumanji really felt like a breathing place.","Jumanji",6308,3.1,-0.4

"6313",4.5,"  The whole family enjoy this!! We're huge fans of the original and went in expecting this movie to disappoint. Pleasantly we loved it! The original is still better but this was fun the whole way through!! The cast did a great job portraying their teenage counterparts. Jack Black was probably the best at acting childlike but that is too be expected.Worth a watch for sure!!!","Jumanji",6313,3.1,-1.4
"6314",4,"  I like the stars that were cast and thought they actually worked well together. I also liked how they gave reference to the original movie. And the video game aspect was pretty cool.","Jumanji",6314,3.1,-0.9
"6315",4,"  Jumanji is basically the original 1995 film mixed with 'The Breakfast Club' and although its characters are thus stereotypical, they are still very well developed, likable and the interactions between them are amusing. Karen Gillan and Jack Black stole the show here as the former is badass and the latter is hilarious. The film has excellent world building, great humor and such a fun story. It is the best video game movie since 'Wreck-It Ralph' and it's also the most purely entertaining film of the year.","Jumanji",6315,3.1,-0.9
"6316",4,"  Great movie for all ages.","Jumanji",6316,3.1,-0.9
"6317",3.5,"  This movie was fun. I especially enjoyed Jack Black's character throughout the movie. While not a cinematic masterpiece, it was worth seeing and I wouldn't mind seeing it again.","Jumanji",6317,3.1,-0.4
"6318",5,"  Loved it !!! The Rock does it again with this star studded actors in a fun movie that was worth seeing on the big screen.","Jumanji",6318,3.1,-1.9
"6319",4,"  Hilarious, smart, and undeniably fun. Finally, a comedy that taps into the potential of character stereotypes and outlandish story-telling that makes sense.","Jumanji",6319,3.1,-0.9
"6320",4,"  When I first heard they were making a sequel to Jumanji, I was against it. However, upon seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised. This is an entertaining movie. It builds on the original movie, but it can stand on its own, and the film creates a new set of obstacles for the heroes to overcome. Plus, it features plenty of action and plenty of laughs. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a sequel done right.","Jumanji",6320,3.1,-0.9
"6321",4.5,"  (85/100)Wow this was entertaining to watch!","Jumanji",6321,3.1,-1.4
"6322",3.5,"  as a fan of Dwayne's work I was looking forward to this movie, but I feel like i was a bit overhyped, i kept reading good things about it and literally read 0 bad things. So naturally i was a bit disappointed when i finally saw the movie. Never the less I do love the movie. A good movie to see with your family or friends (or both).","Jumanji",6322,3.1,-0.4
"6323",4.5,"  Funny, but it's hard to see how the boardgame connects with this videogame. COULD HAVE BEEN better but all together, it was pretty good.","Jumanji",6323,3.1,-1.4
"6324",3,"  At first watch this movie was entertaining however afterward I realised the plot was very thin and I probably wouldn't watch it again. The acting by the young characters at the start and the end of the movie is really corny and I don't blame the actors themselves, I blame the material for that. This movie is based on humour and features video game tropes very prominently. At first watch I found the video game element of the movie to be good entertainment folly however after the movie ended I realised they only did this because the plot was so thin and they had no other ideas. The actors are all good in their roles and the movie is meduiumly funny all the way through. Again however there are drawbacks to this because the original Jumanji movie was scary, eerie, well written and was done on a grand scale. This movie doesnt do those ideals justice it was heavily reliant on humour and video game tropes. I also felt like there should have been more animals involved...considering they were in the jungle after all. Of the animlas that were featured they were clearly CGI and I felt it would have been more realistic to use real animals for the close up's at least. This movie did entertain me when I watched it however after the credits rolled I realised this was only on a superficial level and there was no depth to it.","Jumanji",6324,3.1,0.1
"6325",5,"  Never a dull moment. The film was throughly entertaining.","Jumanji",6325,3.1,-1.9
"6326",3,"  Overhyped. This film is too kiddie and bland with not enough interesting material to go around for the length of its duration. The entire film runs out of steam way before its third act...and Dywane and Hart have been funnier in other pieces.","Jumanji",6326,3.1,0.1

My only gripe is that the promos so heavily featured the rock and kevin heart, when by far the funniest in the movie was jack black. He was the best high school girl character i have seen in a long while!","Jumanji",6352,3.1,-1.9
"6353",2,"  The effects have improved (as you'd hope they would over the course of 22 years), but Welcome to the Jungle didn't really do much for me. It completely lacks the charm of the original movie, but also the worldly scope of the animated series. I sat there patiently as weak joke after weak joke bounced off of me ineffectually, but the person I watched it with seemed to be having a great time, so maybe I'm just dead inside?","Jumanji",6353,3.1,1.1

"6355",2.5,"  good movie, but compare it to the 1995 Jumanji i think they lost the sense of the originality of the 1995 version. I was expecting the whole real dimension would turn into a safari place instead of them being sent to the Jumanji. I guess I just love the mix between real dimension and the wildlife like the 1995 version of the movie. but, it's a worth to watch movie after all.","Jumanji",6355,3.1,0.6

"6365",4.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle is an entertaining and hilarious sequel that I went into with low expectations and came out extremely surprised. The cast was incredible, and all of their performances were very funny and fun to watch (Jack Black portraying a teenage girl was hilarious), and there was also a lot of character development for an action movie like this. The scenes in the jungle are also very beautiful and the special effects are wonderful at times.

"6372",3.5,"  The first time I watched the trailer for this movie, I thought my self that this was going to ruin ""Jumanji's"" name. I decided to give the movie a chance and watched it on theaters. Ok, the film is not bad, it really makes you laugh in some scenes. Johnson, Black and Hart really saved the movie. I liked the story (in some parts) and the way they did the whole ""Jumanji"" concept. I do not agree on those un-real scenes where un-human situations happened to the characters, it is something i am not very fan of in movies like this (unless I am seeing those low budget films that you see on tv only). I mean, they had the production to make these scenes more believable. The end I'll give it a 2/5, I felt it very forced and I think that every people in the theater already knew how the movie will end. I give it a 3 1/2 stars rating, just because the film was more than I expected. I think that the cgi is a lot to fell in love of the film. If the movie would not had the ""Jumanji"" name, I think it would be an amazing and original movie with upcoming parts. At least now, I will not be to much of a fan to see a second or third part of it, only if they decide to do it the old school way.","Jumanji",6372,3.1,-0.4
"6373",4.5,"  Jumani Welcome to the jungle is One of the best films to come out in 2017 and it was worth the wait. The cast does such a good job with the comedy and action in this movie.

"6380",4.5,"  This movie may have been my favorite comedy of the year. My expectations were not exceptionally high for this remake. The original jumanji is a timeless classic, and i'm glad to see this movie did not try to piggy back off of that. Jack Black is the star of the show in this film as he finds himself playing a teenage girl trapped in a fat man's body. he had the entire theater in tears by the end. despite the hard carry from jack black all the other characters were also well written and portrayed. The video game world they chose to use worked perfectly with the story. the mix of comedy and performances from the star studded cast makes this a must see regardless of your opinion on the original.","Jumanji",6380,3.1,-1.4

"6383",5,"  Damn. I loved it, Hilarious","Jumanji",6383,3.1,-1.9
"6384",4,"  I am going to be completely honest with you......when i heard they were making a ""Reboot"" of the Robin williams Classic, ""Jumanji"" I wasn't on board with that; When Robin williams passed I felt that the magic and comedic aspect that went with the movie passed along with him. And while the movie became a cult classic the thought of a sequel, NEVERTHELESS a reboot with Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson and Kevin Hart was out of the question. ...I can admit when i'm wrong. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, is a somewhat 'Reboot' and moreso a Sequel to the 1995 Cult Classic starring the Late Robin williams and a teenage Kristin Dunst; set a year or two directly after the sequel we find that the game evolved with the times (cause who like board games anyways?) and four high school teenagers are caught in its web (or Drum snares) and are instantly sucked into the game itself where they have to play the game to LITERALLY survive the experience. The concept/story is simple enough but even a simple story needs good actors to carry it along and normally when you think of adventure stars Kevin hart and Jack black wouldn't be the names to pick out of a hat but along with Dwayne Johnson and Dr. Who/Guardians of the Galaxy star Karen Gilliam it evens the playing field in a way both funny as well as semi-heartwarming. Jack Black playing a girl trapped in a man's body is interesting but funny all the same; while I wouldn't say he stole the show he did make this movie all the more funny. Kevin Hart as ""Fridge/ZOOLOGIST"" is basically kevin hart in this role. he plays pretty much the same characters as he does in other films but it works for this movie and teaming up once again with his partner in crime The Rock makes for some fun and lighthearted moments and some laugh out loud instances. Karen Gilliam as the awkward teenage girl turns badass is also a welcoming change to the group she's every bit a funny as the guys are and she works well along with the rock. The movie takes ALOT of nods to the Animated show (yes there was an animated series in the 90s), and some call backs from the 1995 movie which was a nice easter eggs bringing the old with the new and while they do add these easter eggs the movie itself can also work as a stand along movie as well so you don't have to watch the original to gain understanding but if you want to SWEETENED the deal you can watch the original movie and watch this for an added effect. The movie changes the rules making a board game into a video game; drawing out all the aspect of how video games are done. even the NPCs in the game act EXACTLY how an npc character acts (repeating the same lines, etc) they the actors play on it which makes it funny until its not. And while they do explain while Karen's Character is dressed skimpy some people (mostly SJWs) might not like her appearance. The Main antagonist Bobby Cannavale (Van Pelt.....maybe related?) is very weak; he doesn't do much except be scary and make the story flow. I felt that he couldn't have done alot more but I don't know if the writing allowed much room for him to break out. The fifth player, played by Nick Jonas who's backstory i won't spoil it here is also a interesting change of pace. Even though he shows up much later in the movie he does bring a bit of the Robin williams-ish to the role; There were some creepy moments and some death scenes that won't settle for kids as well as some minor adult humor but still this movie works for both kids and adults. In the end. This is a SURPRISINGLY very fun movie. This can work as a stand alone movie as well as a sequel; while the story is simple enough and the bad guy was very Marvel MCU weak the premise is very engaging and laugh out loud funny. Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle is a movie i'm glad I got to see and i would see again as well as the original....now if they can do a sequel to ""Zathura"" with the same four Teens and same four actors then you got my money!! 4 out of Five stars Chris W.

It's still doing several millions weekly in the US, far more than Star Wars is taking.Really fun movie, despite a really simple generic plot and one-dimensionable generic villain - that's really not a criticism either.A bit slow to start but once it got started my whole family loved it. The stars' chemistry and offscreen friendship really shines through and Jack Black proved to me he is a pretty good actor when he's not being full-on Jack Black.There are a couple of callbacks to the 90s Jumanji film but it works really well as a standalone.Loses half a star for low-quality CGI pantherS.","Jumanji",6386,3.1,-1.4
"6387",4,"  GenreAge RatingLemonradarAction/Adventure10+80% sweetIntroductionHi, I am Keaton Marcus from Sweet and Sour Movie Reviews and today I will be reviewing the sequel/reboot to the film Jumanji starring an all star cast. When four teenagers, Spencer, Jeanette, Bethany and Fridge are sent to detention for doing various things they are forced to clean up an old warehouse, though when Spencer finds an old Video Game, the teens are intrigued into playing, but they find out this is no normal Video Game when they get sucked into it after choosing characters, Spencer, the wimp is now Dr. Smolder Bravestone, the champ, Fridge, the football player is Dr. Moose Finbar, Zoologist and Weapons Valet, Jeanette the introvert to Ruby Roundhouse, badass warrior and Bethany, popular high-school girl into overweight Dr. Sheldon the map specialist. When they find out that they have only three lives in the game and strengths and weaknesses they must find out how to save the game and go back home.How Was The Cast?In this second paragraph I will be telling you if the cast performed well or not. For our first main character we have Dr. Smolder Bravestone who is played by Dwayne Johnson. I thought that Mr. Johnson just found another suitable role for himself combining his badass former roles to a quite charming, funny and well developed character, there were some narrative problems as there were in every action movie, but Mr. Johnson did just fine at brushing those problems away. Overall Dwayne Johnson did a good job on providing his classic entertainment to the audience while giving something new. For our second main character we have Dr. Sheldon played by Jack Black. I really think Mr. Black should win something for this role, I mean this was the real classic laugh-out-loud kind of performance as the perfect character for him, good jokes, funny script and fit in just right with the plotline. Overall Jack Black has just again proved that he still has his charming appearance in Comedy movies. For our third main character we have Ruby Roundhouse who is played by Karen Gillan. I thought for a very new actress Ms. Gillan did an amazing job on this new kind of action/comedy movie, you know her as Nebula in the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies so this is a very new, uncomfortable role for her and she did just fine bringing her charm from former roles into this very important character in the film. Overall Karen Gillan was a little shaky at times, but on the whole provided a highly watchable, intriguing character that the audiences were deeply satisfied with. For our fourth main character we have Dr. Moose Finbar played by Kevin Hart. Mr. Hart is very used to these kind of roles, almost every movie he is in is a comedy/action movie and he was really just made for these kind of scripts and he did just that in Jumanji. Overall Kevin Hart is a comedy veteran and for that reason he was just perfect for this genius, comedic role of Moose Finbar. On the whole the cast had to deal with some flaws but were very used to the comedic atmosphere and were well chosen for the movie.QualityIn this third paragraph I will be telling you if the overall quality in the movie was any good or not. First we will start with the directing. I thought that Jake Kasden did a very good job on creating not just a good action movie, but a seriously funny premise, good, creative characters and a reboot that was much better than the lackluster original, I also thought that Mr. Kasden did not just focus on the funny script, but a decent story and plot line too that really made sense and worked with the title of the film. Overall Jake Kasden has just created a very successful reboot/sequel to a bad first movie with developed characters, a sensible story and just a really nicely directed film. Next we have the visuals, CGI and the cinematography in the movie. First we will start with the visuals and CGI. I thought this was an amazing part in the movie, but what was good about this was that it was not a CG fest and they had a balanced way of combining awesome 3D visuals and a good movie with a surprisingly reasonable 90M budget. Also there was a good variety of decent visuals, creative animals, cool, slick and fun action scenes and really everything a good visual movie should hope for. Now we have the filming in the movie. I thought that like the visuals, this was very cool and one of the best strengths in the movie, with all of those awesome 3D moments, the camera always stayed on track unlike most stupid action films. Overall the filming and the CGI work was exceptional, but also not too much and worked together in a very excellent and creative way. Last but not least we have the storyline in the movie. I was really surprised at the quality in the story, the film gave just enough time to let the visual flash and the smarts of the film to shine in great ways, the story and plot made sense, it was deeply creative, cool, fun and very entertaining. Overall the storyline was very well constructed, and thoroughly meant for entertainment.Aging 'The Jungle'In the fourth paragraph I will be telling you if this movie is for kids or not. First we will start with the violence in the film. Obviously there are explosions, gunfire, evil animals and other maybe scary stuff that will affect the younger kids, but for the older ones it is no problem. Next we have the bad language scattered in the film. There are some uses of ass, s..t, hell, damn and one use of boob, but nothing to strong for older kids and is very normal for these kinds of action films. Last but not least we have the sexuality in the movie. There is one reference of erection, tons of flirting and mentions of kissing, one character does have a skimpy outfit and some mild stuff about being good-looking. Overall there is action type violence, some scares, mild uses of language and yes, some sexuality. Based on this information I give the film an age rating of 10+.","Jumanji",6387,3.1,-0.9

"6392",4.5,"  'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is such a fun movie! The cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan are all amazing in this movie and work so well together. The movie is also very funny and entertaining.","Jumanji",6392,3.1,-1.4

"6399",1.5,"  This new story killed the original Jumanji. It is all again the same American values, guy likes girl, girl like guy. I am so tired, bored and disappointed that the US only sells the same story over and over again. Holiwood wake up, don't be afraid to explore other ways to express your society thoughts. Look at Guillermo del Toro movies. He is a genious. He brings imagination back to live. Jumanji supposed to be with animals being the center of the attention and the director just turned the story into an American loving cheese story again. Boring boring boring. I wish I can get back my 1hr of life after wasting it churching this movie.","Jumanji",6399,3.1,1.6

"6403",5,"  I haven't laughed so much in a long time, especially Jack Black was amazing as a girly teenager and helped to remember that deep inside the adventurer were other characters.It also showed off the type off video games nowadays are popular.","Jumanji",6403,3.1,-1.9
"6404",4,"  A thoroughly enjoyable if not a tad shallow comedy flick that is fun from start to finish.","Jumanji",6404,3.1,-0.9
"6405",4.5,"  Jumanji was hilarious and well made. Although the plot veered slightly with the appearance of Nick Jonas' Alex, the movie kept me engaged throughout. The characters were lovable and their conflicts felt real. Good movie overall.","Jumanji",6405,3.1,-1.4
"6406",3.5,"  It was a refreshing family movie. Bringing back an updated twist to the original movie.","Jumanji",6406,3.1,-0.4

"6408",2.5,"  It was hilarious, but I'm giving it 2.5 stars simply for the excessive cursing in a movie aimed towards kids.","Jumanji",6408,3.1,0.6
"6409",2,"  Def not as good as first one. Disappointing.","Jumanji",6409,3.1,1.1

"6412",2,"  Pathetic. The dialog was so cheesy.","Jumanji",6412,3.1,1.1
"6413",4,"  Definitely funny and action-packed to boot, Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle takes its source material to fresh and entertaining levels with its talented cast--including Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart--who give terrific and hilarious performances.","Jumanji",6413,3.1,-0.9
"6414",3,"  In the end its just another solid comedy.But to be fair is has a good cast and some pretty funny scenes.","Jumanji",6414,3.1,0.1
"6415",4.5,"  It's been a very long time since I could sit through an entire movie and not hear someone laughing. I was a bit skeptical going into this movie but after 2 unsuccessful attempts to watch this movie (the previous two being sold out during weeks 4 and 5), I was finally able to reveal at the pure magic this movie brought to the audience. I very much enjoyed the tribute to Alan Perish... as a child I could only imagine what it was like stuck in the game and now we finally get to witness it.","Jumanji",6415,3.1,-1.4
"6416",4,"  Funny with action. Im sure Robin Williams would have love it.","Jumanji",6416,3.1,-0.9

"6418",4.5,"  Love it. Great movie for the kids as well. Jack Black is perfect in his roll.","Jumanji",6418,3.1,-1.4
"6419",4,"  If you like cute, you'll like Jumanji. No thrills, no chills, just a few smiles. If you can't get into the game, then it's over. Somebody's going to die! I liked Game Night better, but Dwayne needs to make a movie a month so.....here you go. For an $8 ticket, you'll get $8 worth of entertainment.","Jumanji",6419,3.1,-0.9
"6420",5,"  A seemingly casual game that teachers teenagers that looks and popularity shouldn't be their main focus. Also really entertaining with a great cast.","Jumanji",6420,3.1,-1.9
"6421",4,"  Absolutely worth seeing, very funny a good family outing to the movies.","Jumanji",6421,3.1,-0.9
"6422",4.5,"  Mindless fun, and the ""smolder"" haha. I was pleasantly surprised with how good this movie turned out. its fun start to finish. My only complaint is that it starts to veere into what could have been some serious right in the feels stuff in the 3rd act, and then pulls its punch to gut at the last second.","Jumanji",6422,3.1,-1.4
"6423",4,"  Surprisingly hilarious","Jumanji",6423,3.1,-0.9
"6424",4.5,"  Perfect family entertainment!","Jumanji",6424,3.1,-1.4
"6425",4,"  Saw Jumanji about a week after the Last Jedi. Talk about shattered expectations. I was hoping to be blown away by how good Jedi would be and didn't expect much for Jumanji. Jumanji ended up being the better movie by far. It was funny (deliberately) and enjoyable. The story and plot were actually more believable than that other Christmas movie (jedi).","Jumanji",6425,3.1,-0.9
"6426",2.5,"  A so-so remake. A little too silly for adult entertainment. However there were some interesting twists and turns, especially with the character Martha and Bethany. Good counter-traits. The other guys were kind of ho-hum, or pretty much what you'd expect.","Jumanji",6426,3.1,0.6
"6427",2.5,"  Scary concept that makes for a good adventure. Would?ve added half a star if the ?trans? message wasn?t so blatant. Not a fan of the ?empower the underdog teenager? idea ? it definitely wasn?t carried across well.","Jumanji",6427,3.1,0.6
"6428",4,"  FUN MOVIE FOR OLD LIKE ME AND MY TEENAGERS","Jumanji",6428,3.1,-0.9
"6429",3,"  In general, Jumanji is a good movie. It's an overall positive experience. It has very funny moments and the character development is very well done. You feel for them and can relate. However, there is nothing super special about Jumanji. 60%","Jumanji",6429,3.1,0.1
"6430",3,"  I'm not impressed by the recreation, especially when characters are handed specific plot keys, and without them Dwayne probably would have been punching trees. I guess I'm just not used to this extra body part.","Jumanji",6430,3.1,0.1
"6431",4.5,"  I was not excited to see this based on the original, but this movie is one of my favorites in the last 4 years. Very well done, good story, and good humor.","Jumanji",6431,3.1,-1.4
"6432",3.5,"  No Substance, but a fun romp that doesn't overstay it's welcome.","Jumanji",6432,3.1,-0.4
"6433",2.5,"  The teenage main characters' personalities seem penned-in with little integrity, depicting basic personas in equality with the acting capabilities. As the movie unwraps, the performance improves along with dialogue and plot focus, making this film a nice updated and unique remake of the original. However, in comparison with the Robin Williams version it still lacks substance as the characters are never really introduced with any significance, which leads to a seeming lack of both loyal and empathetic depth. Despite this, the characters still display honourable duties to each other, overcome personal and socio issues, and subtly highlight dangers of phone/technology addiction, with the ironic twist of being trapped inside a computer game. All in all a great piece of comic relief.","Jumanji",6433,3.1,0.6
"6434",4.5,"  This was a fun movie. good structure, good characterization. The reboot was plausible and having the actors have to play characters that were avatars of teenagers created an element to the story that was hilarious.","Jumanji",6434,3.1,-1.4
"6435",4,NA,"Jumanji",6435,3.1,-0.9
"6436",4,"  the whole family had a blast! It isn't a good movie or anything, but it is just played over the top by the adult cast - it was hilarious! There were a couple of scenes I burst out laughing in the theater.The villain was dumb, the child actors were not great, the plot was kinda dumb - reminiscent of the 1995 Jumanji movie I can only vaguely recall. But this has the Rock so who cares? (although San Andreas was REALLY hard to watch - bad Rock - BAD!).","Jumanji",6436,3.1,-0.9
"6437",5,"  This Movie is one of the funniest movies of 2017. I really liked Kevin Hart's Character in this movie his character is one of the funniest characters in this movie.","Jumanji",6437,3.1,-1.9
"6438",2.5,"  This was a terrible movie. I still don't trust my neighbor for saying I would enjoy it!","Jumanji",6438,3.1,0.6
"6439",4,"  Loved this movie and loved how they still payed respect to the original, along with updating it for all the kids who play video games now.","Jumanji",6439,3.1,-0.9
"6440",4,"  It's not trying to be anything more then its own stand alone film. Which is good! It's not trying to replace the original and instead plays a pleasant tribute to it","Jumanji",6440,3.1,-0.9
"6441",4.5,"  It is a very good fun family movie. Got me to laugh and enjoyed the movie for what it is, a fun comedy action movie.","Jumanji",6441,3.1,-1.4

"6443",4.5,"  Exciting, funny, clever! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is well made and a great film! I highly recommend it! The only thing keeping it from me giving it a five star review is excess innuendo. Besides that, it was pure awesomeness!","Jumanji",6443,3.1,-1.4
"6444",4.5,"  Not the best remake, but very entertaining","Jumanji",6444,3.1,-1.4

"6446",3.5,"  A fun romp, not groundbreaking, but certainly 2 hours well spent laughing.","Jumanji",6446,3.1,-0.4

"6451",4,"  Action and laughter make for a nice night at the movies","Jumanji",6451,3.1,-0.9
"6452",3,"  Fun movie to watch with friends, mediocre all around. The humor is what you'd expect. Generic story, predictable at times, but can get a laugh every once in a while. The video game aspect of it left a lot to be desired. Unarguably the best part about it is Jack Black, but that's the only thing that shines from this movie.","Jumanji",6452,3.1,0.1
"6453",3.5,"  Stupid but fun. That basically sums it up","Jumanji",6453,3.1,-0.4

"6456",3,"  this went from ""really a Jumanji remake?"" to ""you know I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel"" The Rock manages to respect the original yet completely reskin it and it almost feels like a completely different franchise","Jumanji",6456,3.1,0.1
"6457",4,"  Hilarious!! Awesome fun movie!","Jumanji",6457,3.1,-0.9
"6458",4.5,"  Jumanji was so funny and entertanin. You will just fall for some of the charecters in theis movie. I highly recomed it to more macher vewier and not littel kids of inapraprit people. It is avery good movie to wach with freind of family.","Jumanji",6458,3.1,-1.4
"6459",1.5,"  Not a kid-friendly movie unless you want your kids to see predictable sexual innuendoes. The movie fell flat and was a missed opportunity to pay more detail to the story and cut out the simplistic slapstick humor.It's mildly funny. Looking back I'm not sure if would even Redbox it though.","Jumanji",6459,3.1,1.6
"6460",4.5,"  Glad I went to see this, I almost didn't but I made the right decision. So humorous!","Jumanji",6460,3.1,-1.4
"6461",3,"  Light drama with a cheesy stereotypical love story and a lovely comedy with the Iconic Kevin Hart, but it wasn't the best film, I think 3 stars is best for this film.","Jumanji",6461,3.1,0.1
"6462",5,"  Great action adventure and comedy","Jumanji",6462,3.1,-1.9

"6471",3,"  It's the comedy that makes this movie great. As a huge fan of The Rock & Kevin Hart, it's not possible to not have a good time. But it can be really cheesy and corny at times, reminds me of a Disney movie. But that's why it works for everyone.","Jumanji",6471,3.1,0.1

"6478",4.5,"  This was one of the most fun times that I have had at the movies. Jack Black plays a better teenage girl than an actual teenage girl could have. He was probably the highlight of the film. The jokes in this movie landed every time. The entire cast does great and plays really well off each other. Its just a very fun movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun.","Jumanji",6478,3.1,-1.4

"6485",5,"  This won't win any oscars, and don't go into it thinking it might. What it is....a good time at the movies. Funny and entertaining. Had no expectations going in except a couple fellow parents word of mouth that it was good. Came out thinking....that may have been most fun I've had in a theater in past year. A few curse words, but overall really fun movie for teenagers, families, and anybody who played RPG video games from the 90's on. Loved it.","Jumanji",6485,3.1,-1.9
"6486",3.5,"  I had a lot of fun with this movie as Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart all were really great in the roles they were in. It got bad as it went on but for the most part it's a solid movie and I hope that a sequel happens.","Jumanji",6486,3.1,-0.4
"6487",5,"  What a surprisingly great film. Was very skeptical and thought it would be a campy testosterone fest. Very funny and great character development. This is the only movie I like the Rock in.","Jumanji",6487,3.1,-1.9
"6488",4,"  It's fun and fantastic. At no time do you get bored. But its relationship with the original version, of 1995, is not fully understood.","Jumanji",6488,3.1,-0.9

"6490",4,"  A really good film. Even if there are a few weak moments.","Jumanji",6490,3.1,-0.9
"6491",4.5,"  Just another action movie from the Rock. No more. No less entertaining? Sure. Special? No. Fun yet tedious at points.","Jumanji",6491,3.1,-1.4
"6492",3.5,"  Strengths: The team of Dwyane Johnson (Dr. Smolder Bravestone) and Kevin Hart (Franklin Finbar) is a hilarious one that worked even better here than it did in Central Intelligence. Everything Hart did was hilarious. Karen Gillan (Ruby Roundhouse) and Jack Black (Prof. Sheldon Oberon) were both very good, as well. Seeing all these characters being uncomfortable in their new avatars made for several hilarious moments. This also had the tall task of following the original Jumanji, which is kind of a cult hit. They did very well to stay a bit true to the original, while still being fresh on its own. The writing and dialogue is solid, while the special effects are very good.Weaknesses: The film lacked a strong antagonist. While Bobby Canavale (Russel Van Pelt) is a good actor, the character barely got any real development. He felt very one-dimensional and the insects constantly crawling on him felt out of place. Also, while I understood the need to establish the teenagers in their normal world, it can't help but feel like filler, because we all want to get to the jungle portions of the movie with the bigger stars. Also, while Jack Black is funny at times, he can come across as over the top at others. Overall: It's not a movie you go into expecting Oscar-worthy stuff. This is exactly what it should be. A good old fashioned popcorn flick. You won't have much more fun at the movie theater with many other films.","Jumanji",6492,3.1,-0.4
"6493",3.5,"  I thought it was a good film but maybe a little to silly. I thought the acting was fine and it was like riding adventure ride at a theme park. Over all good but not Great!","Jumanji",6493,3.1,-0.4
"6494",3.5,"  Having grown up watching the original 'Jumanji' film a countless number of times, it's healthy to have doubts about what a modernization let alone a complete reboot/re-imagining would turn out to be. However, despite this film's sub-title borrowing from a 2003 Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson vehicle (or 'The Rundown', 2003), this film is a surprising and largely entertaining treat that delivers on all the goods an adventure flick, especially one set within in a video game rather than surrounding a board game unexpectedly does. One of it's biggest deliveries in entertainment is the charming cast, who're all acting against their own type as the avatar's of teenagers stuck in a video game world (Jack Black, especially!). Even when the film adds some small tribute to the late Robin Williams of the original film's fame, this film is more of a uniquely conceived and executed wild ride, rather than borrowing anything from the original film at all. Overall, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is a largely fun, hilarious and outrageously entertaining ride that matches any escapist material viewers might be looking for. Even for a film with a huge focus of being stuck within a video game world, adhering to video game mechanics, skills and rules, which can be questioned but also experienced as entertainment at the same time.","Jumanji",6494,3.1,-0.4

"6501",4,"  Entertaining and funny. This is an example of a well succeeded remake. While the Robin Williams-Jumanji got stuck in its own incapability of producing believable CGI-animals this one is making up for ALL of that. It's suitable for a large audience and addresses up-to-date issues the world is struggling with. The cast is a steady group of actors who were well prepared before shooting started and it works. If you wanna have a roller coaster-fun-time then go see this movie. Again you can see the big difference between the critics and audience reviews. I would advice, stick to what the audience says. Those are the most honest opinions. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter","Jumanji",6501,3.1,-0.9

"6505",4.5,"  Kevin Hart is not funny at all and really the only person to play himself. Loud and annoying and always swearing. The real stand outs in this movie were Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, & Karen Gillan. Nick Jonas was okay too.","Jumanji",6505,3.1,-1.4

"6521",3.5,"  This is a very fun family flick that's well acted, well made, and has some good clever aspects to it. Kevin Hart though is a little too Kevin James-ish for my taste and the world isn't very consistent at times. The villain is kind of bland, but I'd definitely would buy on dvd.","Jumanji",6521,3.1,-0.4

"6527",3,"  Good fun - that does not crap over the memory of Robin Williams. The Rock playing a nerd occupying the body of The Rock worked surprisingly well. Jack Black channelling camp to play a regular social media obsessed girl less so. Go see either now or when it appears at Christmases to come ***.25","Jumanji",6527,3.1,0.1

"6530",2.5,"  Jumanji is a solid meaningless comedy with a good cast and quirky personalities. Nothing offensive, nothing amazing. The plot and villain were weak but that could be due to the idea of the movie playing in an old eighties videogame.","Jumanji",6530,3.1,0.6

"6534",3.5,"  A fun film that is difficult to compare to the original. The story is brought up to date with many references to modern day gaming. Good all round performances with plenty of giggles along the way but nothing that gives you the wow factor.","Jumanji",6534,3.1,-0.4
"6535",4,"  Very good movie. Best (and only) movie I saw that was released in 2017. : )","Jumanji",6535,3.1,-0.9
"6536",2.5,"  I will say that I didn't enjoy this movie that much. I have to acknowledge there are some meaningful lines said from the characters, however, the plots are not attracting that much. Because the producer need to combine the jungle story with the teenager story, you need spend some time to introduce the teenager background, which is, in my opinion, a little bit redundant. This reduce the overall pace. If it is a pure jungle movie, action and adventure type, I will say it deserve more popcorns. But I do remember some meaningful lines (may not be exact the same ones because I cannot remember that clear):When you have only one life to spare, you have to treat it very seriously. You need to trust that you have this ability to fly the helicopter, just like I have the ability to become a dance fighter. If you dare push me again, I am gonna push back.Rely on each other and don't blink a second.The missing piece is not an object, it is you, pilot. Overall, teamwork, trust, emotion, caring for each other, brave, wisdom, sacrifice, all those quality the teenagers didn't have before, they gained it through the video game. Also very practical to our lives.","Jumanji",6536,3.1,0.6
"6537",4,"  Levels up the action, hilarity and fun-times","Jumanji",6537,3.1,-0.9
"6538",3.5,"  Oh wow The Rock, Jack Black and other people play Jumanji for real! I'd give it more stars if Robin Williams was in it, but SJWs forced him to kill himself.","Jumanji",6538,3.1,-0.4
"6539",4.5,"  A combination of great theatrical elements, decent acting, and humor makes this movie a must watch. It is clear from the well written screenplay that the producers of the movie put hard work into creating an entertaining and unique film. The humor in the movie made the nail biting moments in the movie even more enjoyable, as it leaves the audience fretting over what will happen next, but simultaneously laughing.","Jumanji",6539,3.1,-1.4
"6540",3,"  Average popcorn movie. Like the original more thrilling one","Jumanji",6540,3.1,0.1
"6541",3.5,"  Funny and charming movie filled with intense action scenes but muddled by a thin plot and sometimes wooden acting. The humour is spot on yet you can't help but think about how senseless it is, an unneeded sequel but a rarity, one that is better than the original. A good movie for one-time viewers, though less interesting by the second view and dull by the third.","Jumanji",6541,3.1,-0.4
"6542",4,"  Much better than I expected. And better than it deserved to be. A worthy sequel, though not as much fun as the original.","Jumanji",6542,3.1,-0.9

"6552",3.5,"  I thought the film was fun, with brilliant effects and a decent story line. Obviously it is going to be compared to the original Jumanji, which I don't think it has the same heart and impact, but it is a good film in it's own right. Loved how they modernised the film to keep with todays society and social media ect.","Jumanji",6552,3.1,-0.4

"6556",4,"  ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is a sequel to the hit movie ""Jumanji,"" It is about four high schoolers who get sucked into a video game called ""Jumanji."" They become avatars in this game and are given challenges that enhance each of their character's inner strengths and weaknesses. Spencer Gilpin becomes Dr. Smolder Bravestone, Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson is Moose Finbar, Bethany Walker turns into Professor Shelly Oberon, and Martha Kaply plays as Ruby Roundhouse. They must fight must fight for their lives in order to survive the game, finish all the levels, and get back to the real world. And here is the scary part - if they die in the game, they are stuck in Jumanji forever! This movie is directed by Jake Kasdak, which is widely known for other popular movies, such as ""The Accidental Tourist,"" ""Silverado,"" and ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story."" The characters of ""Jumanji"" are played by some favored actors and actresses. Playing Dr. Smolder Bravestone is Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Heart as Moose Finbar, Jack Black as Professor Shelly Oberon, and Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse. The genre of this film is extensive in the sense that it contains comedy, drama, romance, adventure, science-fiction, and much more. It is rated PG-13, which makes this a great movie to watch with family or friends. A movie closely related to this one is ""Wreck it Ralph"" due to the fact that it runs the same way ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" does. Both movies have characters who are trying to complete tasks throughout a video game in order to succeed or survive to get to the end of the game. This movie works well for me because it was a great mix of humorous and adventurous. It keeps the audience wondering how the characters are going to survive, what strategies they will use, and how the ending may be because of the different character's strengths and weaknesses throughout the film. The angles in the camera were great, things looked realistic, yet cartoonish, as if in a real-life game. The camera was steady throughout the film in quiet and parts that require focus, yet there was a lot of close-ups and far shots when it was needed to be like that in those moments. The thing I would would change for this film is playing the four high schoolers as stereotypical types of students, because it gives us a hint of why the video game characters are their complete opposites, which is to teach them a lesson. The music was also very good in this movie as well as the sounds played throughout the film for animals, humans, weapons, and the ""magic"" aspect that makes up the whole film. Overall, I would say that this movie fits into most genres, specifically adventure and science-fiction. It is a fun-well rounded movie for families and teenagers, as well as adults!","Jumanji",6556,3.1,-0.9
"6557",3.5,"  Entertaining and funny!","Jumanji",6557,3.1,-0.4
"6558",4.5,"  I went to see this movie without knowing what I would get.I was nicely surprised as the cast is really nice, the humor is good and I didn't get bored during the movie.Of course we all know the story of Jumanji, but it's 2018 version of Jumanji.I would recommend to people who just want to have a great time and want to see a funny movie with very nice actors.","Jumanji",6558,3.1,-1.4
"6559",1.5,"  Why did I watch this movie? Oh yea because I have enjoyed watching comedic movies with a similar cast like Central Intelligence ok I just like Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart who is a really cool guy I hear is like a mini bonus(no pun intended). Aside from a random Vegas scandal to detour fans from actually enjoying the film for what it is did not mess up the buzz. Afterall this is a sequel 22 years after a cutting-edge and successful movie starring the Late Great Robin Williams. My fave character he portrayed of his was Genie from Aladdin, but I digress. Jumanji switches it up for the times so it's a video game instead of a board game? Ok well-played yet this is the shortest video game ever. Where are all the cut scenes and easter eggs and oh yea I forgot Jumanji morphed into a 16-bit console system which is lame. Then you use new actors who we've never seen before and then give us avatars of people who we know. I must admit Jack Black can't save this movie all by himself, because actors tried their best to play a character that was younger and not them full of flaws and all. Yea teamwork hooray but NO. This movie was not that funny at all. I can't laugh at Kevin Hart or other people dying and respawning. It got old before it got old. I know there are giant animals and chase them and it didn't seem like a fun video game. Now to the actors credit I know I've been hard on you and I'm sure the shoot schedule was rigorous and you didn't get a chance to develop your characters but the story didn't enable the characters to rise to the surface in any way shape or form. It's like ok Maps, thats your job. Ok Dance Combat and you're like wtf. The characters don't even seem like friends in real life and we expect to follow them on this adventure. This is unique in a sense because you usually don't have well known actors playing kids aside from Bruce Willis in the cartoon Bruno the Kid and Tom Hanks in Big. And aside from Rob Schneider alot of actors doing comedy bits don't have a woman trapped inside them. I'm sure there are more movies but humor me this is a Jumanji review not a film lesson. So if you wanna watch it you can and you may laugh and you may be like man this plot sucks but hey don't say I didn't warn you because the consistency is off and I was glad it was over then was like... I actually watched this","Jumanji",6559,3.1,1.6
"6560",3.5,"  Fun popcorn entertainment. The strength of the acting and the fun premise of awkward teenagers in the bodies of grown adventurers prop up a generic script. Jumanji is no Citizen Kane but it's certainly good for a couple of hours of entertainment.","Jumanji",6560,3.1,-0.4

"6569",4,"  4/5. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is surprisingly (to most people. I totally called it) really good. With charismatic performances and a lot of fun moments, this is really solid as far as sequels go. Not all of the humor lands, but for the most part, this is an all around solid movie.","Jumanji",6569,3.1,-0.9
"6570",1,"  Please no. Funny in parts, but all-in-all, I won't get those hours back.","Jumanji",6570,3.1,2.1

"6573",5,"  It is so refreshing to have a comedy that isn't reliant on making dirty/lewd jokes which is fine, but having an all around comedy makes it more interesting. This movie is highly entertaining and pays great tribute to the original movie while maintaining an originality of its own. The acting is great and I almost lost track of time.. That's how you know you're really enjoying a movie. Highly recommend this movie!","Jumanji",6573,3.1,-1.9

"6580",4,"  funny, great performances. Its a nod to the classic one with a modern touch.","Jumanji",6580,3.1,-0.9
"6581",4,"  Fun and games. So before board games had their recent renaissance, they went out of style for a stretch of time. To continue existing, the board game Jumanji had to adapt and become a video game (just go with it). When four high schoolers get entrapped in the game, they will have to work together to survive the dangers of the jungle and escape back to reality. I don't think there was hardly anybody that was looking forward to this. I know I most certainly wasn't. I don't really remember the original Jumanji all that well, and this was a sequel that nobody was asking for. I didn't really get excited for this until I heard a review that said that this had an actual script instead of having two hours of actors improvising, and that is the precise moment I started taking this seriously. The filmmakers pulled a fast one and ended up making a smart and wildly entertaining roller coaster ride that is fun for everyone. I totally get the decision to go with a video game in this over the board game. It makes sense so as to be more culturally relevant, and it also allows it to be more mainstream and have more appeal to today's youth. It was a choice that really paid off, and if you have a background in gaming, you're going to get a bonus layer of smart in-jokes, and it feels like they are there just for you. From NPCs that only have certain lines to say to typos in a game just because quality control wasn't always a thing throughout the years, you're going to have a really uproarious time with this. You do have to just roll with the setup, as it is probably the flimsiest part of the film, but they don't dwell on it, they just get it out of the way as quickly as possible to get you to Jumanji, and once you arrive, it is hilarous and entertaining to the end. On top of all that, you have honest to God chemistry between the four leads. They are all kids who have personalities that don't match the bodies that they are in, and it is a ridiculously good time to watch play out. They even imagine to utilize Kevin Hart correctly which happens less and less often as the years go on, and Jack Black really steals the show playing a teenage girl. There really isn't a weak link in the bunch, and you become invested in it because they build up the stakes. It's a huge surprise for me being that I don't have strong feelings for the original, and Jumanji is one of the biggest crowd pleasers of 2017.","Jumanji",6581,3.1,-0.9
"6582",5,"  Wow...I'm a Rock fan as well as Hart AND Black fan, but this was a very pleasant surprise. It follow the main premise of the original movie but with a fresh direction and update to engage today's audiences. The parallels orchestrated with cell phones and video gaming were ingenious, while the comedic value and timing were spot on without being just down right stupid. I didn't by any stretch of the imagination intend on seeing this flick in the theatre, so believe me when I say it was an unexpected treat...If u haven't seen it, u don't have a reason not to now...","Jumanji",6582,3.1,-1.9
"6583",5,"  I loved it...hiarious, laughed throughout the whole movie. Jack Black was very funny portraying a female in a male body.","Jumanji",6583,3.1,-1.9
"6584",4,"  Great movie! I personally thought this was one of those movies that was just fun to watch! With the humor, character development, and just how the story was put together made for, in my opinion, a very solid adventure comedy.","Jumanji",6584,3.1,-0.9
"6585",5,"  An amazing movie, exceeded every expectation I had going in to it. As a fan of the original movie I was a little skeptical going into it, hoping they wouldn't ruin one of my favorite movies. Boy was I wrong, with an all star cast the movie was amazing. Jack Black was my personal favorite as he played a teenage girl, spot on. All the actors had me rolling in my seat, not wanting the movie to ever end. Fairly family friendly except for two scenes describing aspects of the male anatomy but that was the extent. Highly recommend going to see with older kids, a great movie for the whole family. I will definitely be purchasing this movie when it is available on dvd.","Jumanji",6585,3.1,-1.9

People may say the first Jumanji is better, but they clearly haven't seen Kevin Hart ride an elephant. I say you should heading out the door right now to what I believe is one of the best comedies of 2017.","Jumanji",6604,3.1,-1.9

"6611",3.5,"  Nice watch for when you have friends around. An easy movie to laugh at because of it's characters. They did a great job with casting. I don't usually like Jack Black, but I liked him in this movie. Seeing Nick Jonas was quite a surprise.","Jumanji",6611,3.1,-0.4
"6612",4,"  totally fun, saved by The Rock","Jumanji",6612,3.1,-0.9
"6613",3.5,"  Not as magical as the original, but this has an extra dimension through the way the characters become different people inside the game.That allows for some ""deep"" readings of subtext... if you are so inclined especially around the Jack Black character.A fin trip, exciting but not about to scare the kids.","Jumanji",6613,3.1,-0.4
"6614",4,"  I must admit that I enjoyed the film a lot. I wasn't expecting that at all and that's the reason why I ended up not watching it at the cinema. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes no one's positive opinion would have convinced me to go to the cinema. I am just such a fan of the original - I grew up with it - that I could think of absolutely no plausible connection between the original and a stand-alone sequel"" with The Rock, whom I actually like a lot, that didn't make the second one a really bad film made just for profit. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised and I hope you too!","Jumanji",6614,3.1,-0.9
"6615",4,"  This turned out to be a much funnier movie than I expected. The plot as a whole was so boring and formula that it could have been written by a computer - but there were these scenes nestled inside that were incredibly funny, with sharp, witty dialogue, well thought out characters, and excellent performances. Jack Black in particular was stellar - it was as if he was born to play the role of a fourteen year old girl.","Jumanji",6615,3.1,-0.9

"6627",3,"  Do not take it seriously.the cast had a lot of fun with this, and I did, too. but remember it is essentially people in a live action video game. if you expect serious realism, you will be left out of the entertainment.","Jumanji",6627,3.1,0.1

"6629",3.5,"  Great movie, I do wish they had kept this a little more pre-teen friendly. The 10 year Olds would have enjoyed, without the girl turns to boy stuff, IMHO this was gratuitous, there was no need.","Jumanji",6629,3.1,-0.4
"6630",1,"  The movie lacks any comedy and uses the same jokes that are lays used in a rock and Kevin hart movie. ie. ""Kevin Hart is short"", ""I'm the rock: a tough guy"". The best part about this movie was Jack Black who stole every scene he was in. He gave me the my only real laugh of the entire film. The movie has a hobble script and the directing is nothing new or special.","Jumanji",6630,3.1,2.1
"6631",5,"  Great cast and funny","Jumanji",6631,3.1,-1.9

"6637",1,"  really terrible. i laughed here and there. jack black was surprisingly decent, considering i normally hate him. but there are two reasons i hated this movie. 1) it was barely funny. so many parts were glaringly unfunny, jokes that don't land and have me straight-faced or worse, rolling my eyes. 2) so many ridiculously cheesy moments. cringe-worthy omg moments. laughing at how bad it is moments, you can do it, believe in yourself moments. smh. and some stuff made no sense. the villain use completely useless even tho i like the actor and he has proven he can be a great villain like in boardwalk empire. and the action was also completely useless nonsense. i'm not even talking about the super strength and stuff, i didn't mind that. but some of the other action scenes, omg, like... i basically checked out with like 20 minutes left, and i didn't even care to finish it (1 viewing)SPOILERS... the stampede helicopter chase, smh","Jumanji",6637,3.1,2.1
"6638",5,"  Loved it becoz Kevin Hart got the best parts","Jumanji",6638,3.1,-1.9

"6641",3,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is an entertaining movie that picks up where the original left off, albeit this time as a comedy. While overall I found it enjoyable, the movie did often forget that it was a Jumanji film, and the e them play in other films. Hart is still funny playing himself, but the real stars are the other Dwayne Johnson who plays a shy and insecure boy (compared to buff an confident), Jack Black who plays a ""pretty girl"" who is obsessed with appearance and Instagram fame, and Karen Gillan who plays a nerdy girl who is awkward and insecure. Tworld of Jumanji falls to the sidelines.While is obvious from the trailers, this time the game of Jumanji is played in the form of the video game. Each character in the movie is playing a high-school aged persona, very different from the characters that each actor generally plays in films. To this end, is the main entertainment that the film brings, and is also my biggest complaint. While I enjoyed watching actors play characters that are out of their element, the movie was more about the actors playing atypical roles for themselves, and less about the world of Jumanji. This was my biggest problem with the movie. You are watching a variation of ""13 Going on 30"", ""Change Up"", or ""Freaky Friday"" more than you are a sequel to Jumanji.The longer the movie continues, the less the movie is about the world of Jumanji. By the third act of the film, the world of Jumanji is no more than a backdrop for the actors to continue goofing around and trying to sloppily wrap the story up with a good moral for the kids in the audience. We only really experience the world of Jumanji through 4 specific challenges, where each main character has their moment to shine as they are tailor-built to accomplish the challenge.The movie is predictable, and the animals, events, and challenges the actors face in the world of Jumanji are not as deep as the original film. The challenges are pretty easy and the actors make their way through it with relative ease. The introduction of a villain in this film was unnecessary, as overcoming the game should be more than enough conflict for our heroes (as it was in the first film), to interest and satisfy the audience. The villain was weak to the point of being forgettable (one of my friends actually forgot about this character completely).While the action/adventure portion of the film never grows legs, the comedy portion of the movie is where it really shines. Each actor and actress did a great job at playing characters that are out of their element and they are visibly enjoying doing so on-screen. Kevin Hart is the one actor who failed to really embrace his alternate persona (he plays the buff sports jock), as he defaults to the standard Kevin Hart routine of being black and being short jokes. Basically Kevin Hart plays himself, while the other actors really play something unique from what you sehese three do incredible jobs performing outside of their element and are really the stars of the show.Don't go into Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle expecting it to be an action-adventure as you will leave disappointed. However it does succeed at being a comedy and was still an incredibly entertaining time at the movies and will be a movie that adults and kids can watch together and have a great time.As a word of caution: this film is advertised as a family film, and keeps the gore to be non-existent (when people die they just dissapear, you don't ever see blood or gore). However there is a fair amount of adult language and adult jokes in the movie, making it hard to recommend for anyone with young children. Several jokes of male parts, several are drawn out significantly (Jack Black's character is technically a woman and spends about 90-120 seconds of screen time experiencing being a man for the first time). There are several similar comments/remarks/jokes throughout where she refers to her new-found body parts.","Jumanji",6641,3.1,0.1
"6642",4,"  Really good comedy movie. Funny and entertaining, doesn't overstay its welcome, fun to watch. Definitely recommended.","Jumanji",6642,3.1,-0.9
"6643",5,"  Didn't think it was going to be that good, but I was so surprisingly blown away by the entire new take on Jumanji.Karen Gillan, took me almost the entire film to finally figured out where I have seen this total hottie before. (It was only like 2 seasons of Doctor Who). But besides the good looks, she totally rocked the inner nerd's attempt at being a sexy seductress. Totally comical.Dwayne Johnson turned in good performance in the type of roles he is very good at. Not Academy Awards worthy, but entertaining.Kevin Hart (congratulations on your prediction that the Eagles will soar over the Patriots!!!) and Jack Black were awesome supporting characters in this movie. Totally worth going to see twice or more. No wonder it ranked top of the Block Office again after being out more than 2 months.","Jumanji",6643,3.1,-1.9
"6644",4.5,"  Plot stayed all in one. Great Cast, Funny Moments, Kevin Hart. Jack Black pretty much acting gay, its pretty hilarious.","Jumanji",6644,3.1,-1.4
"6645",5,"  I'll admit that I was very skeptical when I saw that a new Jumanji movie was to be released. I loved the one with Robin Williams, and I'm tired of remakes, reboots, and even sequels to some extent. But as I saw more and more previews, I really began to change my opinion on whether I would see this movie. Finally got to see it last week, and I can't say enough great things about it. The premise of the story is the same: people get trapped in a game. But the way the story played out was new. The story was very well written. The action was fun. There was a lot of comedic events within the movie as well as some moments hat might make you tear up a little. The call-back to the original movie was brilliant. All the actors did a great job. I wish I had the time to see it again in the theater, but I can't wait until it comes out on iTunes so I can watch it again and again.","Jumanji",6645,3.1,-1.9
"6646",4,"  Actually pretty decent. Funny and updated twist on the classic","Jumanji",6646,3.1,-0.9
"6647",4,"  Really cute and funny. This is a far departure from the original book, but I think a great improvement too.","Jumanji",6647,3.1,-0.9
"6648",5,"  This film was SO funny. I watched this with one of my friends and we couldn't stop laughing.","Jumanji",6648,3.1,-1.9
"6649",4.5,"  I think this is one of the best action comedies I've seen. The plot is built on nice character moments which both provide seriousness, comedy and actually grow the characters. The sense of peril also feels real, and I had actual goosebumps in the theater. For the most part, the comedy hits home, but a couple of the gags were a bit juvenile for my tastes. Even those didn't break with the tone of the scenes though, so it didn't ruin my enjoyment. I would recommend this film to anyone.","Jumanji",6649,3.1,-1.4

"6652",4.5,"  Funny film that keeps you on the edge of your seat ready for more! However, the humor levels go way down toward the ending, which in my opinion, the level should have gone up. Definitely worth a watch.","Jumanji",6652,3.1,-1.4
"6653",4.5,"  Absolutely too much fun...!!!Highly recommend this one to everyone, worth not onyl seeing but seeing againThis passes my ""Blue Ray Test"" (is it worth owning permanently?)Critics as usual have too much to think about rather than simply telling us it is a good movie or not..This one is actually BETTER than the original, but the Critics are too busy 'defending their craft' to see it","Jumanji",6653,3.1,-1.4

"6659",5,"  Afraid that this would be made purely for the nostalgia, and not respect the original, this was a giant surprise. I don't know why, the cast is stacked!

"6662",2,"  I was really looking forward to movie. It's a shame it was such a disappointment .The only thing that was good about this movie were the actors, who did their best with the downright awful and BORING dialogue.I found myself going to sleep after the 100th time that a character had to be motivated to continue on with something.Shame, the comedy was great at mostly, shame it's the story that didn't work out.","Jumanji",6662,3.1,1.1

"6677",3,"  I really enjoy the movie have quite a lot of funny moments. Was good for a Sunday movie.","Jumanji",6677,3.1,0.1
"6678",4,"  Jumanji is an adequate blockbuster that takes its time in developing the protagonists, introducing and overcoming internal struggles, and teaching each character a lesson in the process. Each star plays as an insecure high school teenager, who, now in a video game, has been provided with super powers to take on menacing threats that are far worse than anything they had encountered before in the real world. The cast does a hilarious job playing as stereotypical teenagers, most notably Jack Black, who plays as an Instagram-obsessed valley girl in a performance that makes him feel exactly like the same girl we are presented with in the beginning of the movie. On the other end, Kevin Hart, where he did provide the kind of humor that he normally presents in any of his other comedies, didn't feel like the same character that he's supposed to be playing from the onset of the film. Karen Gillan and Dwayne Johnson are both marvelous at playing shy characters with a romance between them, and that is set up and executed in a style that many action movies have gone by over the years, only this was one of the few that put a smile on my face by the end of the movie. Go check out the movie while it's still in theaters, it's full of humorous performances and a simple story that will leave any audience member satisfied.","Jumanji",6678,3.1,-0.9
"6679",4.5,"  Ridiculously entertaining. Worth seeing just for Jack Black's performance. I was concerned this would be a remake which couldnt possibly live up to the original. Fortunately, they came up with an entirely new story based on the Jumanji concept. Went with a group of 13, ages 7- almost 70, and everyone loved it.","Jumanji",6679,3.1,-1.4
"6680",3,"  Overall this movie is very fun, but there are a lot of below the belt gender jokes that I wasn't too fond of. It also doesn't have the heart of the original. The video game twist was a fun idea on how to make it more modern, but they were able to figure out the premise too quickly when it wasn't a board game. Even though it felt a bit predictable to me and Karen Gillan seemed really uncomfortable in her costume I did still enjoy watching The Rock run around in the jungle.","Jumanji",6680,3.1,0.1
"6681",4.5,"  Its the Rock in a goofy adventure movie! Jack black does these cringing bits, that only he can pull off. Kevin Hart is damn funny and Karen Gillan is the eye candy... This was a well written and fun movie!","Jumanji",6681,3.1,-1.4
"6682",4.5,"  Funny and entertaining","Jumanji",6682,3.1,-1.4
"6683",1,"  terrible ..this movie was utter garbage..the mystical board game degenerated into a video game.Raping our childhoods with these silly sequel reboots. Jumanji becomes another victim and the Sheeple love itI could care less if I ever see these 3 actors in another movie..","Jumanji",6683,3.1,2.1
"6684",3,"  A bit cringe-worthy and cliche at times. It didn't live up to the first one and they try to make up for that through special effects and jokes. This could've gone from a decent movie to a great movie if they had worked through the story more. It felt like the story was lacking throughout. The ending could've been better too.","Jumanji",6684,3.1,0.1
"6685",4,"  Enjoyable movie with a splash ok romance, comedy, and mainly adventure","Jumanji",6685,3.1,-0.9
"6686",3.5,"  A fun and new life added to a movie that we only remembered from Robin Williams's line, ""Run! It's a Stampede."" The actors portrayal of characters unlike themselves helps enthrall the audience. The movie was enjoyable, though the entire premise was poorly constructed. However, that is not why I went to see the movie so I was pleased with the outcome.","Jumanji",6686,3.1,-0.4
"6687",0.5,"  Another stupid The Rock movie. Sad that the Jumanji name part of this movie, the real Jumanji is a classic!","Jumanji",6687,3.1,2.6
"6688",5,"  This movie reviews the classic parts from the original movie and still find?s a way to be original in this wonderful classic Jumanji. It is an all ages movie where you will find yourself in laughter by the amazing performance of Kevin Hart! The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) is fantastically acted in this action packed movie. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat through your the whole movie of all it?s vivid events! It is made to be enjoyed!","Jumanji",6688,3.1,-1.9

"6694",3.5,"  Escapist family fare that benefits from a likeable cast and a fun concept.","Jumanji",6694,3.1,-0.4
"6695",3.5,"  Using the standard set by the first Jumanji, this film was very good. It adopted a modern look of the classic story but with a fresh and overall funny attitude. Now, this is not Oscar nomination material, but you should not be expecting that.","Jumanji",6695,3.1,-0.4
"6696",4,"  One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Jack Black is a more convincing highschool girl than most teenage girl actors. Dwayne Johnson delivers a surprisingly strong and self-aware performance, and Kevin Hart is being Kevin Hart so if you like him in anything else you'll like him here. The movie does a great job of unashamedly including every action movie trope every and making it very obvious it was done on purpose. It's campy, it's fun, it's got a surprising amount of character and charm to it, and it's just a joy to watch.My two gripes are that I wish they played up the video game theme just a little more. It kind of fades in and out of focus during the movie. Sometimes, it's obvious and fun and you can tell the writers have played old-school action games like Tomb Raider. Other times the movie kind of forgets, especially when the focus shifts to the characters. Also, the CGI is a bit below 2018 expectations, and they missed a great opportunity to make a joke about bad graphics. Other than that, super fun movie. Not the most groundbreaking movie, but just a good time for all.","Jumanji",6696,3.1,-0.9

"6704",4,"  Well, Dwayne Johnson was a great choice to act Spencer in the Jumanji World. The cast was really awesome too .","Jumanji",6704,3.1,-0.9
"6705",3.5,"  I liked this movie, but probably not as much as others. I feel like I knew what was going to happen before it happened, However, I was entertained and enjoyed the laughs this movie offered. :)","Jumanji",6705,3.1,-0.4
"6706",3.5,"  The trailer had the best parts. But still I enjoyed it. It was a good upgrade from the original to modernize it. The cast is great and everyone is fantastic. My favorite is still Jack Black! He is hysterical. But I actually was impressed with Jonas.","Jumanji",6706,3.1,-0.4
"6707",2.5,"  Slow, slower, slowest. OK it´s beautifully evocative of the 1980s. Summer in Italy. Apricots. Lots of swimming_ Will Elio go for the girl Mazia, or the creep Oliver. It takes a lot of deciding ' a lot of shots of Elio in his shorts (the same ones - he has a limited range of underwear) Anyway Oliver doesn't deserve him. By the time we get to the end we have lost the will to live and no number of bike rides will do...","Jumanji",6707,3.1,0.6
"6708",4,"  Enjoyable film with a fresh spin off the original.","Jumanji",6708,3.1,-0.9
"6709",3,"  I truly don't know how the rock keeps putting his money that are not brilliantly acted or produced but just entertaining enough to keep coming back to his films for some reason. (outside F&F franchise). The real teens simply can be cut out of the movie since its poorly acted anyways, but the in-game stuff is where the cringe stops (most of the time).","Jumanji",6709,3.1,0.1
"6710",5,"  Loved it! Fun from start to finish.","Jumanji",6710,3.1,-1.9
"6711",3.5,"  Very enjoyable film. Laughs at every turn and solid performances turned in by The Rock and company. For me a definite buy on Blu-Ray","Jumanji",6711,3.1,-0.4
"6712",3.5,"  It was a fun film to watch overall. While it wasn't anything special and the some of the characters themselves felt kind of bland, I'm still glad this movie was made and had a blast seeing Kevin hart and the rock on the big screen again","Jumanji",6712,3.1,-0.4
"6713",5,"  The movie was hilarious and well made. A little too adult for children but enjoyable for the audience who grew up on the original.","Jumanji",6713,3.1,-1.9

"6726",5,"  Got to go see this with my daughter 2 weeks early with Amazon early access and I tell you it was amazing... Not only was it a great comedy but it had so many layers ... It touched on everything friendships, not fitting in, and so many things ... It has easily become one of our favorite movies and have since seen it with my other daughter and two of my friends.... Go see this movie ... And laugh you butt off","Jumanji",6726,3.1,-1.9
"6727",4.5,"  Saw the new Jumanji today & it was actually pretty damn good! Intended for an entire family audience than the last, had some good self-aware jokes.","Jumanji",6727,3.1,-1.4
"6728",4.5,"  A very fun moviegoing experience that leaves audiences satisfied after modernizing the original premise it was based on, as well as providing ample time for Jack Black to comment on his anatomy.","Jumanji",6728,3.1,-1.4

"6734",0.5,"  Yesterday I saw Jumanji with a friend.We left after one hour. I could not bear it any longer.That movie is the worst I have seen in a very long time. Normally that's not a reason to post something on instagram, but I want to tell you what is so awful about that movie.It is full of prejudices and stereotypes. A few examples after the ""plot"": There are four teenagers who get sucked into the game Jumanji. By getting sucked into the game they also receive the bodies an abilities of the game characters.One of those teenagers is black. At first, he is a rather cool guy, but bad in school. First shit: why has the black guy to perform bad in school? Second shit: When he is finally transformed into the character he changes from the cool guy into the dumb guy, the one people laugh about. He becomes the joke of the group. And he acts like so many other black joke characters in US-American movies: He is short tempered and clumsy. Why always the black guy? I mean really: Why does it always have to be the black guy who is the clumsy sidekick of the main hero (who is most of the time white)?Third shit: One girl happens to be the smart one who does not want to participate in gym class and is rather shy. When she is transformed she becomes a sexy killer machine who later has to flirt with some guys in the game to distract them. Another girl (now transformed into a chubby man) teaches the sexy killer machine how to flirt with guys in general, because the smart one has never done it and does not know how. Why does the smart girl needs to be taught by the ""cool and pretty"" girl (now the chubby guy) how to flirt with guys? I don't get it. She is good looking and very intelligent, she will get a man (if she wants to) not by knowing how to flirt with dumb-ass guys who only want to f*** you/her but by being amazing. Why is it presented in this movie as if the ability to flirt with guys is necessary for girls/women?The story itself is crap, too. I cannot recommend the movie at all and I am so looking forward for the humanistic and feminist revolution which is so long overdue for all of us: women, men, people of colour (why is the colour even still an issue?), people with different sexualities and so on and so on.I'm so sick of all that chauvinistic, racist, homophobic etc. bullshit and nonsense!!!!!","Jumanji",6734,3.1,2.6
"6735",4,"  Surprisingly very good. Funny, different than the original, and I think better than the original. Some life lessons in there too for kids about friendships. Some language, but mainly great.","Jumanji",6735,3.1,-0.9
"6736",4.5,"  Jack Black puts his comedic presence back on the map. The Rock and Kevin Hart are highly entertaining as usual. However, Nick Jonas almost stole the show with impressive character development in a minor role.","Jumanji",6736,3.1,-1.4
"6737",4,"  Really liked it. Southland w/Shawn, R&JWould re-watch","Jumanji",6737,3.1,-0.9
"6738",3.5,"  It's exactly what you would expect from a movie with Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black. It's funny and fun, but don't expect the actors to stretch to play their characters. It's the Rock in the jungle, wiith Kevin Hart making constant short jokes and comments about his inadequacies, while Jack Black plays an off the wall diva.","Jumanji",6738,3.1,-0.4
"6739",4,"  This film is a hilarious and fun twist on the original...Jack Black is the stand out, but the whole cast commits and it works","Jumanji",6739,3.1,-0.9
"6740",5,"  It was great to find a movie that all three of my kids could get into even though one typically likes cartoons, one is a ""tween"" and wants characters, and the other is fifteen and often disinterested in films. I was thrilled that this wasn't the same as the original and jokes about the new generation on their cell phones in class had me laughing.","Jumanji",6740,3.1,-1.9
"6741",5,"  I loved this movie and really want to go see it again!!!","Jumanji",6741,3.1,-1.9
"6742",5,"  In a world where a lot of sequels fail, Jumanji succeeds thanks to the amazing cast","Jumanji",6742,3.1,-1.9
"6743",5,"  This is by far my favorite Jumanji. The one with Robin Williams use to be my favorite before I saw this, so many laughs... my favorite was Bethany played by jack black..he is always phenomenal","Jumanji",6743,3.1,-1.9
"6744",4.5,"  Not really a fan of Kevin Harts shitck but Jumanji was a great film nonetheless & you can tell the cast had a lot of fun playing their characters.","Jumanji",6744,3.1,-1.4
"6745",4.5,"  Loved Karen Gillan & Dwayne Johnson in this film. They really brought the action and a lot of humor.","Jumanji",6745,3.1,-1.4

"6747",5,"  It was nice to see a different take on the movie I enjoyed watching. It was hilarious and kept me entertained.","Jumanji",6747,3.1,-1.9
"6748",4.5,"  This was an AMAZING watch & a pretty good sequel to the original. After dreading watching it, I finally saw it with some friends and it was really enjoyable. Kooky at places, but just enough. Would recommend to anyone who has seen the original.","Jumanji",6748,3.1,-1.4
"6749",5,"  Highly recommend ! it was hilarious","Jumanji",6749,3.1,-1.9
"6750",2.5,"  Oddly enough, The Rock's most personal movie.","Jumanji",6750,3.1,0.6
"6751",2,"  Just awful. The movie just didn't spellbound you in its story and scenes as the original. The movie just slightly works due to its nonsensical humor","Jumanji",6751,3.1,1.1
"6752",4,"  Great movie. I was skeptical that they could pull off a part 2 this much later and make it work and be relevant to life then and now. It's quite funny but also touches on some topics of self image that every high schooler should hear.","Jumanji",6752,3.1,-0.9
"6753",3,"  This is a very funny movie, to stay watching when one zaps","Jumanji",6753,3.1,0.1
"6754",3.5,"  Had some good laughs","Jumanji",6754,3.1,-0.4
"6755",5,"  Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a really good movie way better then expected. It had good humor and the story was also really well done, it is worth watching","Jumanji",6755,3.1,-1.9
"6756",4,"  Jumanji was really fun and had enough things that were nostalgic but a lot of new things that are a new and exciting.  Dwayne the rock johnson and Kevin Hart were all great. If they make a sequel, I hope they put enough care into like they did this with this movie.","Jumanji",6756,3.1,-0.9
"6757",4,"  This looked like it might be a movie that showed all of the best parts in the trailers, and that was not the case at all. We really enjoyed it.","Jumanji",6757,3.1,-0.9
"6758",3,"  It was an alright movie and pretty funny actually ! I really expected the film to be completely trash but I was wrong","Jumanji",6758,3.1,0.1
"6759",4.5,"  If we don't talk about the old version of Jumanji, This it the best Jumanji movie for me","Jumanji",6759,3.1,-1.4
"6760",3.5,"  what's there to say, it's an action movie revival of jumanji with the rock. that being said, it plays as an action movie with the rock.","Jumanji",6760,3.1,-0.4
"6761",4,"  Quite funny and actually better than expected, even the first one!","Jumanji",6761,3.1,-0.9
"6762",3,"  Yet another testament to the growing Hollywood trend of remakes, sequels, and reboots that only encapsulate a shell of what their predecessors represented. Instead of the tender musings on childhood, adulthood, time, and fear that the original possessed, we get some recycled thematics that you can find in any 80's high school flick. Instead of the smart and effective humor that made the original film so entertaining, we get dick jokes. It simply doesn't even flick a booger in the direction of the original. . .but it's still watchable. Yes, even I'll admit - though I wasn't looking forward to this flick at all (and although I still ended up not even liking it that much) it ended up containing a bit more competency than I was expecting. The video-game-isms are entertaining, the lead performances are definitely stimulating, and even though there are still some glaring, fundamental issues with it, ""Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle"" is still somehow worth the watch.","Jumanji",6762,3.1,0.1
"6763",3.5,"  This movie is way better than I thought it would be. It was pretty funny. But it was also pretty cliche. Overall not a bad movie. Pretty enjoyable.","Jumanji",6763,3.1,-0.4
"6764",3,"  Ok, this movie will not win any major awards but what it will do is entertain you to no end. Funny, clever, well written, and the onscreen chemistry between all the actors is just superb. Go see it if you want a silly, fun night out and away from your problems. You will laugh and cheer and be glad you saw it ... unlike Star Wars The Last Jedi -- once that abomination is seen it cannot be unseen.","Jumanji",6764,3.1,0.1
"6765",4.5,"  great funny movie, one that I could watch over and over. Great choice of characters and cast.","Jumanji",6765,3.1,-1.4
"6766",2,"  Ridiculously sexist outfit for Karen, and of course her first talent is to be a sexual distraction to the enemy. Her dance fighting took forever compared to her male counterpart.","Jumanji",6766,3.1,1.1
"6767",4,"  Jack Black does scary accurate impressions of a 15 year old girl.","Jumanji",6767,3.1,-0.9
"6768",4,"  Solid 4 stars for this movie - I was sold when I found out The Rock and Jack Black were cast :) Totally awesome premise, how they went in and came back out as totally different people. I also really liked the action involved and the way they played in the original movie. It was not just a reboot, it was a whole new movie.","Jumanji",6768,3.1,-0.9
"6769",3,"  Good balance of humour with its kid friendly action, but plays it a little too safe in my eyes. I felt the story could have done with been up a level from PG.","Jumanji",6769,3.1,0.1
"6770",5,"  Never seen people Laugh out Loud in Cinema like they did in Junmaji 2. The movie is so fun to watch specially for gamers. I enjoyed every minute of it , spectacular movie, beautifully made and a must see.","Jumanji",6770,3.1,-1.9
"6771",4,"  Enjoyable, I see little flaw in it. The good fun the main cast brings is welcome. It's not much more than that though - Good Fun.","Jumanji",6771,3.1,-0.9

"6786",5,"  Pretty good movie! Really interesting and amazing!","Jumanji",6786,3.1,-1.9
"6787",4,"  It distances itself enough to not be a remake of the original film. I love the direction that they took with this story. I also think the casting was perfect. Everyone involved were absolutely born for these roles.","Jumanji",6787,3.1,-0.9
"6788",4,"  THIS MOVIE IS FUCKING HILARIOUS! Seen it twice...","Jumanji",6788,3.1,-0.9
"6789",4.5,"  THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC !! wooo","Jumanji",6789,3.1,-1.4
"6790",3.5,"  (3 1/2 Stars)Hollywood's current M:O of rebooting long deceased franchises or even creating sequels and/or prequels to past films we also thought buried and gone continues to be hit or miss. While Jumanji's story was never a movie I predicted needed anymore of Hollywood's touch, I suppose I wasn't as shocked to see them get the treatment after nearly 22 years from the original. Go ahead and throw together a stellar cast of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan...you may color me intrigued.Welcome to the Jungle doesn't offer the experience the original did. In fact, I'm kind of glad they stayed away from mimicking any of the 1995 version outside of some callbacks and well-placed easter eggs. The original was built on a brand new story and included a fear factor intent on actually scaring you but not to the point of outright horror. But this time, we get full on family fun entertainment. This movie may have been PG-13, but you could have just as easily tagged it PG if only it weren't for the 'deaths' and 'violence' some of characters incur in a video-game-like environment.As was expected, the movie doesn't really kick off until the four students are sucked into the game. None of the teenagers give off a particularly strong vibe of carrying a film, which is why it's left to the big stars like the four I mentioned above. *side note* I'm not sure if it's going to be left open-ended or explained as to how the board game turned into a video game system other than, poof, overnight, but I'm fine if we never learn the true origin of Jumanji. Then again, watch another follow-up film surface in a few years time due to the financial success of this one.Most of the laughs come in the form of self-deprecating humor because of the physical transformations each actor goes through when they convert from their real-life selves into the avatars of the game. Surprisingly, the Rock's and Gillan's characters are too straightforward to really elicit big laughs outside of seeing Johnson act like an elephant every time he sees a mouse. The real laughs come in the form of Hart and Black, who essentially character swap, with Black earning top honors for being inhabited by a 16-yr-old girl. Terrific fun. Unfortunately, this sequel doesn't quite leap past any film from 2017 due to the basic, kid-friendly premise. This one is more about learning who you are or finding one's true self rather than giving us an real threat to our characters. The lesson was clearly more important than the plot.While we were able to see the flip side of the coin Robin Williams character endured in the original, it kept things to the tamest of the checked boxes for a PG-13 rating. This version won't have any parents dragging their children out of the theater like the original may have had, but it'll certainly continue to keep butts in seats through the early months of 2018 as good, light-hearted fun with some solid acting performances even if the entire ordeal was too cheesy.","Jumanji",6790,3.1,-0.4
"6791",5,"  My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. So fun!","Jumanji",6791,3.1,-1.9
"6792",5,"  an amzing third film in the franchise loved it","Jumanji",6792,3.1,-1.9
"6793",3,"  It doesn't really feel like a sequel to the first one, but it's funny enough to be entertaining for most of its duration.","Jumanji",6793,3.1,0.1
"6794",2,"  Although this had a few moments, I'm only giving this movie 2 stars because of the charming cast that works well together and the fact that Jack Black was great as a teenage girl. Otherwise I am just not at all a fan of movies that are based on games & this one was no different. The story was weak and the character development, especially for the bad guy was thin to non existent. I know this movie is huge and I hate to be the Debbie Downer, but this movie was just mindless entertainment with a thin story.","Jumanji",6794,3.1,1.1
"6795",4,"  A successful and updated sequel, some really humorous moments thanks to Jack Black, and an exciting plot at its core.","Jumanji",6795,3.1,-0.9

"6798",5,"  You can't compare this one to the original Jumanji. This was a comedy! I loved it","Jumanji",6798,3.1,-1.9

"6800",5,"  It's better when you are drunk","Jumanji",6800,3.1,-1.9
"6801",4.5,"  WOW! This movie was SOOOOO much fun! The action scenes were great, and the acting was also great. I'm having trouble telling who the best actor was. It's definitely between Kevin Hart and Jack Black. Jack Black played a high school girl, and it surprisingly worked! The humor is just great! If you love action movies see this one. Heck, I haven't seen the first Jumanji movie, so you don't need to watch that to know what's going on.","Jumanji",6801,3.1,-1.4
"6802",4,"  A sequel that's as good as the original Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a direct sequel to Jumanji (1995) which slightly changes the ending of that film and leads directly into this film. This time Jumanji has turned into a video game (for reasons I won't spoil here) and in the year 2016 four teenagers: Spencer (Alex Wolff) a nerd, Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) the jock, Bethany (Madison Iseman) the blonde, and then Martha (Morgan Turner) the rebellious smart chick. All four don't exactly get along and soon find the video game while in detention. The four transport into the video game becoming their avatars that they chose on the screen. Spencer has become Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) a man with no fear and as strong as an ox, Fridge has become Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart) a zoologist that has a weakness to cake, Bethany is Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black) a cartographer...and also a guy, then Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a bad ass fighter. The four of them find out they must return a jewel to a statue to defeat the curse of the game and then they can go home. The kids have to learn who they truly are and work together in order to survive or die in the game forever! The movie has some great action sequences and has a lot of funny moments. The movie obviously focuses on the avatars themselves and not exactly the kids which works here because they obviously carry the film a lot better. The difference here is that it's funny seeing someone like the Rock acting like a kid that is worried all the time and Jack Black as a girl in a mans body. It's a great sequel with a good message about being the person you can really be. Overall, solid film that's doing incredibly well, so I don't exactly have to recommend it since I'm the one behind on catching it!","Jumanji",6802,3.1,-0.9
"6803",4,"  Very interesting along with a few laughs.","Jumanji",6803,3.1,-0.9

"6817",4,"  The new Jumanji is an extremely funny sequel to the original and you will be laughing for most of the time. The story about a group of high school kids in detention finding a video game consul and being sucked into it is quite enjoyable and entertaining to watch. The whole cast is absolutely hilarious and the one thing we all like to see most is Jack Black's character being a teenage girl in real life.","Jumanji",6817,3.1,-0.9
"6818",5,"  Fun movie. Cast chemistry was great. You can tell they must have enjoyed working with one another. One of those movies that surprises you and is better than expected. Very rare that I prefer a sequel--especially one so removed in time from the original--more than the original. Yet, here is a fun, funny and charming sequel that is definitely worth watching.","Jumanji",6818,3.1,-1.9
"6819",3,"  Divertida en ocasiones pero la trama fue muy corta","Jumanji",6819,3.1,0.1
"6820",3.5,"  Really enjoyed this movie! Jack Black completely goes for it and is amazing in this role. It pokes fun at video game stereotypes and its great to see Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Heart working together again; their chemistry and comedic timing is amazing! My only criticism is that it starts to drag towards the end and felt long. I checked my watch a few times to see how much time was left.","Jumanji",6820,3.1,-0.4
"6821",4,"  Filled with fun and exciting action with suspense of the plot.","Jumanji",6821,3.1,-0.9
"6822",3.5,"  Para empezar, la película poco tiene que ver con la origina; Sin embargo, los personajes y su desarrollo dentro de la película logra envolverte sin dejar de ser una comedia simplona.","Jumanji",6822,3.1,-0.4
"6823",3,"  Was a happy, funny film to watch yet had some very weak moments that were poorly acted.","Jumanji",6823,3.1,0.1
"6824",3.5,"  Clever formula that will keep you interested and in the end might move you. Jack Black and Kevin Hart make the movie.","Jumanji",6824,3.1,-0.4
"6825",4.5,"  Didn't expect this movie to actually be good! It was better than good though. Almost great","Jumanji",6825,3.1,-1.4
"6826",3.5,"  This movie is NOT a reboot, as originally thought. It is a sequel - and a pretty good one too. Jack Blacks performance for his character was really impressive! Cameo appearance by Colin Hanks","Jumanji",6826,3.1,-0.4
"6827",3,"  This film will by no means win any awards, but it was none the less a pleasant distraction from the current real world toxic political climate. I enjoyed it for what it is and personally believe it to be better than the original.","Jumanji",6827,3.1,0.1
"6828",5,"  Better than the original in terms of pure entertainment. So much is different between the first and second movies it's almost irrelevant to call it a sequel. Plenty for adults and kids alike. A great family movie for families can cope with a few sexually suggestive scenes without to much discomfort.","Jumanji",6828,3.1,-1.9

"6831",3.5,"  Breakfast Club detention premise infuses a jolt of fun into the Jumanji brand with a clever construct bridging the avatar/real world divide. Acting surpassed expectations across the board, it was evident they had a lot of fun making this film. More suitable for late teens and the college crowd, older parents may find the laughs sporadic. A firm dose of nostalgia for those who enjoyed role playing video games in the late 1980's. Some positive messages for the younger generation about working together on arduous ventures. Overall it is a pleasantly enjoyable experience.","Jumanji",6831,3.1,-0.4

"6836",5,"  Laugh out loud funny!","Jumanji",6836,3.1,-1.9
"6837",3.5,"  The film had likable characters and a cast with great chemistry, although Jack Black's scenes were surprisingly overshadowed by Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. The film wasn't anything ground shaking, but was an enjoyable, light-hearted film","Jumanji",6837,3.1,-0.4
"6838",5,"  Loved this movie, so did my kids","Jumanji",6838,3.1,-1.9
"6839",5,"  It was quite clever of the writers to show the intelligence of the game had evolved from just capturing the player's inquisitive nature of the board game and turn it into a modern day video game which was more likely to peak the player's interest. The storyline followed the same entrapment theme as the original movie and incorporated the 1st films remnants which was inspired. My son and his friends absolutely loved it. Thumps up!!","Jumanji",6839,3.1,-1.9
"6840",5,"  It was fun to watch. But Jumanji 1 was the best","Jumanji",6840,3.1,-1.9

"6846",4,"  It was fun and clever. I really liked it.","Jumanji",6846,3.1,-0.9
"6847",4,"  I always go back and forth on remakes or ""re-imaginings"" (whatever that means) of classic movies-and unfortunately for most of you reading this column, that word ""classic"" in Hollywood refers to any movie made before the year 2000-but sometimes a cool concept can be freshened up without losing its appeal. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle strikes a good balance between staying true to the original children's book by Chris Van Allsburg (who also wrote The Polar Express, for those of you keeping score) and the new gadget-obsessed youth of the 21st century. Instead of a cool wooden board game with pieces and a nifty crystal ball that tells you about what's about to crash into your living room, this particular iteration is a console video game, which would ordinarily thrill any of us who owned an original Nintendo or Sega Genesis, but turns out to be a momentary distraction for four unlikely teens in a set-up that is borrowed straight out of The Breakfast Club. Only instead of some nostalgic, time-wasting gaming, they get sucked into the world of Jumanji where they are tasked with a mission before their lives are all used up.Whoever thought to team up Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson should get a raise, as they are really funny and fun together. Karen Gillian (Nebula from Guardians of the Galaxy) plays the super-hot and super dangerous Lara Croft-style jungle babe with appropriate disdain. But best of all, it's so nice seeing Jack Black be funny again. His selfie-obsessed mean girl winds up in the body of, well, Jack Black, and he makes the most of the material.The special effects are pretty special, as are the stunts and the action; Jumanji is no place for a quiet stroll. And while the plot is nothing complicated, the character interaction and the great performances from the cast make this film a must-see in the theater, where you can appreciate the magical world of Jumanji with other people. Older kids and Generation X Parents in particular will appreciate the mashups in the movie.","Jumanji",6847,3.1,-0.9
"6848",3.5,"  Surprising because it is such fun. Robin Williams' legacy is kept intact by the comedy stylings of a strong cast. I went to the film as a matinee to kill time while waiting to pick up a friend. The audience was small as one would expect on a weekday afternoon but the theater rang with our laughter. On top of this the films is, in many ways, a modern Aesop's fables with a ""moral to the story"" that I found particularly appealing....one is who one decides to be and gifts differing are made stronger in the cmpany of others of good will.","Jumanji",6848,3.1,-0.4
"6849",4.5,"  Very, very funny even though a bit cheesy at times. But thoroughly enjoyed it.","Jumanji",6849,3.1,-1.4
"6850",4.5,"  Expectations weren't high, but this was a hoot! Great fun that I would do again.","Jumanji",6850,3.1,-1.4
"6851",5,"  Jack Black played a really good version of a teenage girl and it was awesome to see that personality of him. He is almost like the next Robin Williams in a way of speaking","Jumanji",6851,3.1,-1.9
"6852",4,"  Fun movie, good actors, and a good plot. Mostly got what I expected, in a good way.","Jumanji",6852,3.1,-0.9
"6853",3.5,"  Fun and entertaining!","Jumanji",6853,3.1,-0.4
"6854",3,"  The movie, unlike the JUMANJI, lacked the suspense and fear of being part of a game from where you will never return alive. It really funny for sure but easily forgettable one.","Jumanji",6854,3.1,0.1
"6855",5,"  Grab some popcorn, pizza, soda, sit back & enjoy this movie because it was awesome.","Jumanji",6855,3.1,-1.9
"6856",4.5,"  This movie completely exceeded my expectations.I loved it","Jumanji",6856,3.1,-1.4
"6857",5,"  Fun movie to kill a few hours w/o having to think too much. Hilarious!","Jumanji",6857,3.1,-1.9
"6858",5,"  Absolutely loved this movie. Easily my favorite of the year.","Jumanji",6858,3.1,-1.9
"6859",5,"  One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are a remarkable duo in movies. Jack Black just puts it over the tope. A definite Must See for anyone who wants to just laugh and enjoy a movie.","Jumanji",6859,3.1,-1.9
"6860",5,"  I'm really, really excited to see this. Jack Black as a teenage girl = SO excited. Also a sentence that I never had predicted I'd say before. And I was just as pleased as I had expected! The chemistry between these five cast members is obvious, and Karen and Jack's flirt scenes--plus Kevin and Dwayne's funny lines--were absolutely hilarious for everyone in my family of all ages. Such a great movie, and I'll definitely be seeing it again! A sequel would be amazing if it still included this dynamite cast!","Jumanji",6860,3.1,-1.9
"6861",3.5,"  This was a fun twist of the original Jumanji board game we all know and love. The story is more modern by making the setting of the game virtual and inside of a video game. I highly recommend watching because it's the perfect balance of humor and action. Although I would say this is more of a comedy than anything else.","Jumanji",6861,3.1,-0.4
"6862",4.5,"  An excellent follow on from the original with the late great RW RIP","Jumanji",6862,3.1,-1.4
"6863",1,"  Man this was crap.How it gets the good reviews is beyond me.The acting was terrible, actually too much over acting.Jack Black was wasted in this film as a transgender. Hart was pretty good and without him the movie would be really bad.The worst movie the Rock has ever done. He's actually getting worse with he's recent roles. Rock why are you becoming such a pussy and taking these bad roles? Now you're a baby next role if you get one with a tough/bad guy it's gonna be near impossible for you to be convincing again playing all these kiddie films. Bring back the Rock in faster.The film could have brought some great creatures to the movie since it's the jungle but the there were none except a couple of rino's and cats. Poor choice.Cinematography was poor as was lighting.Story was badly told from start to finish. Original is way better.","Jumanji",6863,3.1,2.1
"6864",4,"  This movie struck gold with the amazing dynamic of the cast. The Rock and Hart are just an amazing duo. They really benefited from eachother in Jumanji even more then in their previous movie Central Intelligence. But the biggest win for this movie is Jack Black. JACK FREAKIN BLACK. That delivers one of the funniest performances of 2017. He just nails this role as a 17 year old, selfie addicted girl. This movie really had one of the best chemistry of a cast this year. But the rest of the movie falls a little bit into the normal adventure/action movietropes. Which makes the movie forseeable. All in all it is a fun, light movie. Perfect for a movie night with friends.","Jumanji",6864,3.1,-0.9
"6865",5,"  this movie is awesome haven't laugh that much in awhile","Jumanji",6865,3.1,-1.9
"6866",4,"  better than the original","Jumanji",6866,3.1,-0.9
"6867",5,"  Amazing! I went into this movie expecting it to be bad but I loved it; it was honestly hilarious. Everyone really meshed well together in the cast and the storyline was good. It was a fun movie!","Jumanji",6867,3.1,-1.9
"6868",4,"  Great fun movie with some good laughs.","Jumanji",6868,3.1,-0.9
"6869",5,"  Great fun movie! Highly recommend! Nick Jonas did a great job for his first major movie.","Jumanji",6869,3.1,-1.9
"6870",4.5,"  Great movie! They picked the perfect cast for this movie and it has a lot of laughs.","Jumanji",6870,3.1,-1.4
"6871",3.5,"  For all of it's flaws, and there are plenty, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is entertaining, suspenseful, and funny enough to keep your attention. You don't need to have seen the original in order to enjoy the sequel, but you do have to take a pass at a few on the continuity errors. The Rock and Kevin Hart have a really fun chemistry, this is something everyone knows. Unfortunately, after the initial, few laughs Jack Black's character provides, his presence becomes distracting. Appropriate for teens and older, the action will draw in young and old alike. Let's give some props to The Rock. He's having fun here and it's fun watching him. I totally bought in to his being an awkward nerd. Karen Gillan is really good as well, and that's what makes the movie: the performances. I'm not looking forward to the third version, but then again I wasn't looking forward to this either. A really nice surprise. Final Score: 6.8/10","Jumanji",6871,3.1,-0.4
"6872",4,"  ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" exceeds expectations with a sequel that nobody asked for but yet becomes one of the most surprising movies to come out in 2017. You can see that the cast are having so much fun portraying teenagers. Jack Black steels the show portraying a teenage girl that misses her phone.","Jumanji",6872,3.1,-0.9
"6873",4,"  A great remake and pretty funny. A brilliant cast really makes the film.","Jumanji",6873,3.1,-0.9
"6874",1,"  nothing to see with the old jumanji!! its like ghostbuster ..... ruin classic movies with this re - makes. stop it !","Jumanji",6874,3.1,2.1
"6875",1.5,"  Good story and would have been a good family movie it there wasn't so much talk about boys anatomy.","Jumanji",6875,3.1,1.6
"6876",3,"  Surprisingly or sadly, this movie just isn't fun, not a hollywood biggie.There were more humans than animals in the jungle. On the comedy front, only Kevin Hart kept a little laughs coming and Jack black, a totally wrong cast in the film. The Rock really didn't rock. Several of the action scenes really bored me and he was expressionless.The villain( did he look like one?) had absolutely no role in the story whatsoever and played no threat to the main characters.No actual thrill, adventure or danger with a story like this. Very much predictable .There was not a single part in the entire film that caught me off guard. It was a lame story line. Looked like the climax was also forced and hastily made. Good for a 12 yr old. An all right film for me. Nothing to rave about!!","Jumanji",6876,3.1,0.1
"6877",4,"  A great popcorn flick with some good laughs. Unfortunately it didn't quite capture the dark foreboding feel of the original.","Jumanji",6877,3.1,-0.9
"6878",5,"  Excellent film would of been better if it was a stand alone film instead of linking it back to the old jumanji","Jumanji",6878,3.1,-1.9
"6879",3.5,"  Parts of the movie were pretty funny, however there were a few parts that definitely felt like forced humor. Overall: Hart and Johnson were great together.","Jumanji",6879,3.1,-0.4
"6880",4,"  4-stars for a movie that delivers exactly what you're looking to get.While the premise is simple and the outcome is expected, the acting is what really makes this an enjoyable film. And I'm not even a fan of The Rock, Jack Black or Kevin Hart.Jumanji the sequel loses the magic and wonder of the first movie, but is much funnier.","Jumanji",6880,3.1,-0.9
"6881",4.5,"  This was actually a good fun entertaining sequel.","Jumanji",6881,3.1,-1.4

"6885",5,"  The rock is so cool and awesome","Jumanji",6885,3.1,-1.9
"6886",0.5,"  As a Christian I do not recommend this movie. A big disappointment , what was Dwayne Hohnsin thinking? Hollywood leave our children alone!!!!","Jumanji",6886,3.1,2.6
"6887",5,"  Loved Jumanji. A lot better than the ghost busters reboot","Jumanji",6887,3.1,-1.9
"6888",4.5,"  super funny. My only issue was that the ending was pretty standard and predictable, but that was fine since the movie doesn't really take itself seriously and was more focused on making you laugh.","Jumanji",6888,3.1,-1.4
"6889",5,"  Funny and entertaining... A great watch!","Jumanji",6889,3.1,-1.9
"6890",4.5,"  Extremely entertaining and hilarious. Much better than I expeced or that it had any right to be.","Jumanji",6890,3.1,-1.4

"6894",4.5,"  Funny and entertaining","Jumanji",6894,3.1,-1.4
"6895",2,"  Forced adventure comedy completely unrelated to the original movie (just some little references). Has some good moments... not many. This comment might be affected by the fact that the movie only arrived in local language to my country, not original language","Jumanji",6895,3.1,1.1
"6896",3.5,"  Lots of fun! Karen Gillan can suck my toes anytime!","Jumanji",6896,3.1,-0.4
"6897",2.5,"  A movie that doesn't add very much to it's source material, but is nonetheless a funny and entertaining movie with an interesting take on video games and an excellent jack black performance.","Jumanji",6897,3.1,0.6
"6898",4,"  Better than I have expected, lots of laughs with funny action. Recommend for lazy holidays.","Jumanji",6898,3.1,-0.9
"6899",3.5,"  A heap of fun and laughs.","Jumanji",6899,3.1,-0.4
"6900",3,"  Forgettable movie, memorable jokes","Jumanji",6900,3.1,0.1
"6901",5,"  Best movie of all time I love it the 1st one was ok but ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" was amazing the best ever","Jumanji",6901,3.1,-1.9
"6902",2,"  This ""comedy"" offers very little when it comes to laughs. Most, if not all attempts at jokes fail miserably. If you're looking for a funny movie, this one is certainly not for you.","Jumanji",6902,3.1,1.1
"6903",2.5,"  The latest spin on a classic is certainly entertaining with some great jokes sprinkled throughout. The individual star powers of veteran comedians the Rock, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan, as well as their chemistry cannot be denied. But the entertainment value of Jumanji really stops there. Being a light-hearted comedy, Jumanji can't be faulted for its lack of character development or many plot holes. However, the supposed climax of the movie seemed extremely forced and hastily made. Jumanji will give you some good laughs, but it's not a movie you will be thinking about days after you watch it, or minutes","Jumanji",6903,3.1,0.6
"6904",4,"  I liked this movie a lot. Is it predictable? Sure. Is it silly? Of course. But the cast of characters have a good interplay and the comic timing is great. Jack Black should make a career out of playing teenage girls. I didn't like the original, I thought it took itself far too seriously in spite of the fact that Robin Williams was the lead. This was different and stood alone for me.","Jumanji",6904,3.1,-0.9
"6905",5,"  very enjoyable film. spent boxing day afternoon in the cinema watching this, very funny and enjoyable, which is what a film should be","Jumanji",6905,3.1,-1.9
"6906",4,"  good to see Jumanji back after a long gap!! it's a good movie fun to watch","Jumanji",6906,3.1,-0.9
"6907",4,"  I can't say much bad about this film. The contrast to the mess that was star wars was clear. All the characters did a sterling job, but Jack Black was in a league of his own. Simply wonderful acting. Madison Iseman was so hilarious as Bethany that I was very sad when I knew she wasn't going to be in the whole film. The film is funny, its engaging, the Rock is entertaining as ever, Kevin Hart is great. The game scenario with lives is a very nice idea and works well. The only negative things I would say is that the villain was unconvincing and perhaps unnecessary, Karen Gillan only really got one moment to shine (and for some reason didn't lose two lives), and the long cheesy ending was unnecessary. Still overall cohesive and they didn't overdo the CGI. Very good film.","Jumanji",6907,3.1,-0.9
"6908",3.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is just what the world needed. The movie, while very fictitious and unbelievable in some parts, stays true to the original board game shown in the first Jumanji movie that featured Robin Williams. However, this movie added a modern spin, being shown as a Nintendo game console rather than the traditional board game.The acting was very good as well. Dwayne Johnson did a great job and turned around from a few mediocre performances - particularly Baywatch. This was also a good return by Jack Black, who hasn't been on the scene for a few years. He did a phenomenal job acting as a teenage girl. Kevin Hart did a good job as well as well. He was funny, almost trying too hard at times, and did a fine job being dramatic. Finally, Karen Gillen did a nice job as an innocent, hard-working student turned into a badass female who saved the crew multiple times.Overall, performed an exceptional feat: it followed up an original movie with an equal or better performance. The movie generates positive emotions and the ending, however confusing it may be, did a nice job wrapping up loose ends. The star studded cast did not disappoint this time.","Jumanji",6908,3.1,-0.4
"6909",5,"  This movie was downright hilarious and entertaining!","Jumanji",6909,3.1,-1.9
"6910",4,"  It's such a funny stupid movie! ;)","Jumanji",6910,3.1,-0.9
"6911",5,"  My 12 year old son LOVES the original Jumanji so he had to go see this one. We went last night. He loved it, and I have to admit that I couldn't have enjoyed it more myself. Nothing was inappropriate for his age in my opinion, it was funny and the story was up to date. Very enjoyable.....5 stars!!!!","Jumanji",6911,3.1,-1.9
"6912",3.5,"  Fun movie but not appropriate for young children.","Jumanji",6912,3.1,-0.4
"6913",5,"  Such a great movie with characters! Was really worth watching! Definitely gonna buy this one on blue ray","Jumanji",6913,3.1,-1.9
"6914",5,"  Well written screenplay, and well executed overall!","Jumanji",6914,3.1,-1.9
"6915",4,"  Just enough gimmick for everyone in the family to enjoy... funny, family-friendly adventure with a few animal laughs and a few lessons to follow. Grandparents bring the grandkids.","Jumanji",6915,3.1,-0.9
"6916",5,"  I love this movie it is hilarious (even though I haven't seen it yet.Plus it has Kevin Hart in it","Jumanji",6916,3.1,-1.9
"6917",4,"  A perfect sequel. On another note.....Is the Rock in all movies?","Jumanji",6917,3.1,-0.9
"6918",4,"  This movie was action-packed, well-acted, and fun to watch in general, surpassing the original.","Jumanji",6918,3.1,-0.9
"6919",4.5,"  Dwayne Johnson was one of the key standouts in this film. Jack Black & also Karen. They did a great job playing their characters.","Jumanji",6919,3.1,-1.4
"6920",5,"  Great fun, comedy and action beats. Outweighed all expectations going in!","Jumanji",6920,3.1,-1.9
"6921",5,"  Amazing! Critics don't give it enough credit. They're probably too busy getting paid by disney to give TLJ 5 stars to actually enjoy it.","Jumanji",6921,3.1,-1.9
"6922",2.5,"  Does it have funny moments? Sure. However Dwayne Th Rock Johnson once more manages to bring to the screen the same single layer character he has played in every single movie in the last couple of years. The movie does have some interesting things, but nothing to make it special.","Jumanji",6922,3.1,0.6
"6923",2,"  This was a halarious movie that the whole family enjoyed. It is so rare that my family can find a movie that we all agree on watching. This was overall an amazing movie.","Jumanji",6923,3.1,1.1
"6924",5,"  As far as action-comedies go, this is one of the best of all-time. The premise may be a bit silly (esp. if you never saw the original), but put that aside and you have a movie that is action-packed and full of laughs, without ever failing in either. One of the most entertaining times you can have in the theater!","Jumanji",6924,3.1,-1.9
"6925",4.5,"  A worthwhile comedy that was true to the format of the original. All the characters were well played with no real holes in the acting throughout. A good family film if you don't mind a few penis jokes. (they were biological)","Jumanji",6925,3.1,-1.4
"6926",4.5,"  this was part 2 thank goodness . so tired of remakes . I love the update from board game to video game. the game versions were choosen well. Kevin hart was actually funny in a movie . rock and jack black were convincely funny also. felt like i was playing the game with them. looking forward to a good part 2.","Jumanji",6926,3.1,-1.4
"6927",5,"  Jumanji was a fun film to watch. A classic go to the theater, grab some food, and have a great couple of hours. The movie is very funny as there are quite a few occasions the whole audience was laughing.","Jumanji",6927,3.1,-1.9
"6928",5,"  This was a great movie! My husband and I went to see it during our Christmas vacation. We had heard good things about it, but we were still surprised by how much we laughed out loud!","Jumanji",6928,3.1,-1.9
"6929",4.5,"  Muy divertido y entretenida","Jumanji",6929,3.1,-1.4
"6930",5,"  Good movie. Had a smile on my face from start to finish. As for the critics score. Movie wasn't liberal enough for them.","Jumanji",6930,3.1,-1.9
"6931",4.5,"  Jumanji was no masterpiece, in fact it was panned by critics when it released. This sequel is a fun/entertaining adventure flick that keeps your focus with funny new exciting characters & is also very respectful of the 1995 version. It is standalone film that takes place in the world of Jumanji. One of THE best standalone sequels I've seen.","Jumanji",6931,3.1,-1.4
"6932",3.5,"  Very, very good action comedy. Loved the concept of actors playing two different characters at ones. Jack Black as a teenage girl in a man's body was especially good. More emotional impact than you would expect. Could watch movies like this every day.","Jumanji",6932,3.1,-0.4
"6933",4,"  I really thought this movie was going to be awful, however, I was shocked at how much fun I had at this movie.","Jumanji",6933,3.1,-0.9
"6934",5,"  Haven't seen such a funny movie in a while suitable for families, teens as well as adults. The case did an excellent job and the visual effects are superb.","Jumanji",6934,3.1,-1.9
"6935",0.5,"  This is a shame to late Robert Williams masterpiece Jumanji I really want my time and money back from watching this trash!","Jumanji",6935,3.1,2.6
"6936",5,"  I thought I was going to hate this film. I thought that this film was going to ruin my experience with Robin Williams' classic original film but I was WRONG. This film was a fun ride from beginning to end, all the characters were funny and I thought that the direction they went with was perfect for a new generation of kids who'll then be curious to watch the original Jumanji. I thought that this was a faithful sequel and I would buy it on DVD / Blu-Ray.","Jumanji",6936,3.1,-1.9
"6937",3,"  Trying my new Movie Pass out here..... this was an OK popcorn flick. The four main actors had really good chemistry, with Jack Black being the stand-out. There were some pretty funny moments too and more penis jokes than I was expecting. The Easter eggs from the original Jumanji were fun when they popped up, but this this definitely not a remaking or squeal. The villain was pretty bad.... you could literally edit him out and not even notice. The high school kids were super genetic and boring too. Overall, I would recommend if you have Movie Pass or if this ever comes out on Netflix....","Jumanji",6937,3.1,0.1
"6938",4,"  Gives a 90s movie feel but equipped with modern visuals and effects. Jumanji gives delightful humor, well acting characters and a sufficient plot which make it one of the better comedy films of recent time","Jumanji",6938,3.1,-0.9
"6939",2.5,"  Surprisingly this film turned out better than I had predicted it to be. The previews showed most of the funny parts but there are plenty more in the film to keep interest going. I enjoyed the references to the original game plus Murray (present) from Flight of the Conchords is in this film, what could go wrong. The movie does have a lot of CGI and i've become kind of desensitized to it. The acting is about what you'd expect from the cast. Hart and Black are the comedians and they're on their game for the most part there's not much from the other cast, aside from the Rock who I swear is typecast. The story is ok, and it reminded me a lot of Uncharted (the video game series on PS3 and 4). The teen actors had a short part and that was ok because they were kind of throw away anyway. I may only be in my 30s but man kids these days are so spoiled rotten and vain. At least that's what this movie has you believe. The movie feels a bit too long in the tooth, as in I can guess wahs would be checking their watches during the last third of the film. It wasn't a bad film it just could have been better. That's why I gave it 2.5 stars out of 5.","Jumanji",6939,3.1,0.6
"6940",4,"  This movie was a nice homage to the genius Jumanji movie and a tribute to Robin Williams. I like it's relevance to modern day, but at points it gets confusing.","Jumanji",6940,3.1,-0.9
"6941",5,"  I Liked the penis jokes??????","Jumanji",6941,3.1,-1.9
"6942",5,"  My wife and I found Jumanji to be a great movie. Action, Adventure, Story, and a boatload of humor. Definitely a case where I feel you need to go with the Audience Score rather than the 'Critic' score.","Jumanji",6942,3.1,-1.9
"6943",3.5,"  Okay first with the bad: the villain is so absurd. He's supposed to be Van Pelt, and this is supposed to be a sequel; and yet these two couldn't be anymore different. He's just some gross edgelord.There are indeed severe cliches in the film. They aren't constant, but some really stand out. The romance especially; freaking skipping rocks and no subtly.However I still recommend the film. It is surprisingly good with its comedy, which I would not expect from remake/sequels. Both the character interaction and the chaos of the setting work incredibly well. And the action is also better; you can actually see what's going on and the editing is not trying to use BS cuts and blurs.","Jumanji",6943,3.1,-0.4
"6944",4.5,"  In short: I liked it much more than 'Last Jedi.'This movie does what it does. It's based on a franchise and it's unique. It's cliche and new. Most of all it's enjoyable and goes about its business effectively. It's easily the best of this winter's big budget movies.","Jumanji",6944,3.1,-1.4
"6945",3,"  I kinda loved it? I mean, nothing can top the original movie (nostalgia is a helluva drug), but this was fun and fresh in a different kinda way. Jack Black absolutely steals this riot of a movie. While I wish they would have honored Robin Williams in some way throughout the film (not even a mention? Binch please.), everyone brought their A-game and the ride was a blast. One other quick note: Nick Jonas, stick to making forgettable pop music. You suck in front of a camera.","Jumanji",6945,3.1,0.1
"6946",4,"  This is one of the sequels we've gotten this year (along with John Wick 2 and Blade Runner 2049) that might be better than the original. Great cast, interesting plot/premise, even supporting cast members like Rhys Darby and Nick Jonas (to my surprise) had some laughs. The only main problem I would have to say effects the movie would be the way Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan portray their kids. Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black have a lot of fun with the characters that their given, especially when Black has to interpret a stereotypical teenage girl, but Hart and GIllan seem to be almost completely different characters once we see them in the game.","Jumanji",6946,3.1,-0.9
"6947",3.5,"  It was a funny and an interesting film to watch, the mixture of action, drama, and comedy blends in perfectly, we get to see more new discoveries in the game than its 1995 counterpart, I came out of the Theaters satisfied","Jumanji",6947,3.1,-0.4
"6948",4,"  funny and creative take on a video game movie","Jumanji",6948,3.1,-0.9
"6949",4.5,"  so fresh that it actually could have been a complete new story, very funny. My family loved it!","Jumanji",6949,3.1,-1.4
"6950",4,"  I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it, but Jumanji was actually pretty good.","Jumanji",6950,3.1,-0.9
"6951",4.5,"  I was one of those ppl who doubted this movie when the trailers release. I will never judge a movie before seeing it again because this is one of my favorite fantasy/adventure movies now.","Jumanji",6951,3.1,-1.4
"6952",5,"  It was hilarious and fun! Loved how everything wrapped up, and it gave a nice message.","Jumanji",6952,3.1,-1.9
"6953",4,"  Despite a few critics disliking this movie, I actually enjoyed Jumanji a lot. I liked the characters, I liked the story, and the jokes. This is definitely one of the better movies in 2017.","Jumanji",6953,3.1,-0.9
"6954",3.5,"  Not bad, Hollywood. Not bad. I must admit. I was very against this movie when I first heard about it. I was a fan in childhood of the original, and I only went to the film when I heard good things about it through word-of-mouth. I think the high point of the film was they found a way to pay homage to the original, but make it their own. Also, they actually delved into some character before diving into the plot which is an old storytelling trope not seen much anymore. Unfortunately, the strongest arc was not the lead character, but of Bethany's. They delved with the vague ""friendship"" in other areas which is weaker. And, another weakness is adult actors in the film plays their typical role and brings nothing new to their performances here. Are The Rock and Kevin Hart one trick ponies?I'll keep the word of mouth going. It was good. I recommend.","Jumanji",6954,3.1,-0.4
"6955",5,"  Actually very funny! LOVE how they tied in the first Jumanji!","Jumanji",6955,3.1,-1.9
"6956",4.5,"  I liked the film a lot. One of the funniest movies in years! Loved Karen and Dwayne Johnson.","Jumanji",6956,3.1,-1.4
"6957",4,"  Solid fun with some great acting and homages to original film. Laugh out loud moments and cared about the journey of each character.","Jumanji",6957,3.1,-0.9
"6958",5,"  Great chemistry between Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Hart. Also Dwayne & Karen Gillan. Jack Black & Karen Gillan. Even the Jonas brother does a pretty good job.","Jumanji",6958,3.1,-1.9
"6959",4.5,"  Jumanji was hilarious! & action-packed. Well worth the trip to the movies on this friday night.","Jumanji",6959,3.1,-1.4
"6960",4.5,"  Really funny, pure enternainment, movie didnt take itself so serious. Pure <3","Jumanji",6960,3.1,-1.4
"6961",5,"  loved the movie, excellent writing!!!!","Jumanji",6961,3.1,-1.9
"6962",5,"  Fabulous family fun. Actors not afraid to take the tip out of themselves and a smouldering Rock is the icing on thev proverbial cake. Wonderfully reminiscent of 80's movies - big fun movies without smutty jokes or questionable language. no wonder its been a hit. The only remaining question is - when do they make another one?","Jumanji",6962,3.1,-1.9
"6963",3,"  Jumanjii is suppose to be a fun, action flick that espouses family-friendly morals. To this end, it largely succeeds. However, I don't know if I just miss the performance of Robin Williams, but this sequel does not seem to have the heart, that made the original unique. By painting the main characters with broad strokes, the writers lost an opportunity to really turn a 3-star movie into a four-star classic. In any case, it is fun, but not very clever. The kids will like it.","Jumanji",6963,3.1,0.1
"6964",5,"  It was awesome hearing jumanji being the biggest movie seller ....definitely an awesome movie ...congrats to the amazing cast","Jumanji",6964,3.1,-1.9
"6965",4.5,"  Jumanji is best film I've ever seen so far this year. I would so watch it over and over again. The Rock, Karen Gillan, & Jack Black were hilarious.","Jumanji",6965,3.1,-1.4
"6966",5,"  Jumanji was far more entertaining than Star Wars.","Jumanji",6966,3.1,-1.9
"6967",3,"  Harmless fun - you can see it with your kids without being embarrassed. Won't win any awards, but funny dialogue, even though there is a sappy ending.","Jumanji",6967,3.1,0.1
"6968",1.5,"  Kevin Hart and Jack Black combined still does not even come closer to Robin Williams' original perfomance","Jumanji",6968,3.1,1.6
"6969",3.5,"  3.5 An enjoyable continuation of the Jumanji story with a number of nice call-backs to the original to keep this new story within the same universe.","Jumanji",6969,3.1,-0.4
"6970",5,"  Really fun show. Jack Black is amazing, they all are really, everyone did a really great job, very fun, well thought out. All in all, great fun!","Jumanji",6970,3.1,-1.9
"6971",0.5,"  Unwatchable, typical, Hollywood JUNK. Why do people think its ok to pay for this crap? PC Hollywood junk is taking over and you people are allowing it to happen. STOP SEEING THIS CRAP.","Jumanji",6971,3.1,2.6
"6972",3.5,"  Not terrible. It has some funny moments, but it's not my kind of movie. If you are a fan of Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart, you'll probably like this movie. It's just not my thing. Karen Gillan was pretty hilarious though.","Jumanji",6972,3.1,-0.4
"6973",4.5,"  They did a much better job developing each character is this film then they did in the 1st.","Jumanji",6973,3.1,-1.4
"6974",3.5,"  'Welcome to the Jungle' overhauls the mechanics of the original and tries to make it relevant for its modern audience. Though, its star-studded-ness and hilarious banter only lazily makes up for its underwhelming plot. If you want to see it for nostalgia, don't. See it for Jack Black.","Jumanji",6974,3.1,-0.4
"6975",5,"  My daughter and I loved Dwayne Johnson performance. He really does a great job bringing the fun!!!","Jumanji",6975,3.1,-1.9
"6976",4,"  Funny movie. Dwayen Johnson as usual at his best. Kevin hart and Jack black has done amazing work. Action is good and funny. Movie as many funny scenes and i love amazing chemistry between all top star cast especially between Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson. Movie get slight predictable towards the end but I would still recommend watching it.","Jumanji",6976,3.1,-0.9
"6977",2.5,NA,"Jumanji",6977,3.1,0.6
"6978",4.5,"  Finally checked it out and not as good as I expect seeing the box office but still a good movie very entertaining.","Jumanji",6978,3.1,-1.4
"6979",0.5,"  so bad they didnt even bother with cool puzzles or cleverness or any real good jokes really. just missed opportunity for a good vid. watch skull island instead. laaaaaame","Jumanji",6979,3.1,2.6
"6980",5,"  Without offense to rotten tomatoes.... you guys need a new review board. One of the best sequels to come along this year with as much heart and storytelling as the original and even more funny. A cinematic triumph.","Jumanji",6980,3.1,-1.9
"6981",3.5,"  didn't think they could pull off a sequel worthy of the first movie... i was wrong... and thank you Jack Black for the laughs","Jumanji",6981,3.1,-0.4
"6982",3.5,"  Not quite as adventurous as it should be, and it has some annoying moments (especially Kevin Hart and Jack Black), but still, it is exciting and absolutely hilarious!","Jumanji",6982,3.1,-0.4
"6983",3,"  Its not perfect. But certainly entertaining.","Jumanji",6983,3.1,0.1
"6984",3.5,"  Just a lot of fun. Strays significantly from the original, but who cares?","Jumanji",6984,3.1,-0.4
"6985",4,"  Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart re-team in the ever so bankable adventure romp, chock full of more laughs than most comedies, as gamers sucked into the titular game, forced to work together. If fun at the movies is your go-to, go to this one then.","Jumanji",6985,3.1,-0.9
"6986",4,"  It's been a while since I watched the original Jumanji, though I was curious as to whether this film would be trying to steal the thunder of that classic film. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this new Jumanji took a unique and more light-hearted twist on the existing story, personally, I would recommend this film if you aren't looking for something too heavy or deep to watch - this film doesn't steal from the original more than it lightly celebrates it whilst it does it's own thing.","Jumanji",6986,3.1,-0.9
"6987",3,"  Jumanji is a family comedy that doesn't take too much from the original ,the film itself is well made and has an all star cast !","Jumanji",6987,3.1,0.1
"6988",4,"  This film does a good job of not taking itself too seriously. The fantasy setting provides an easy-going take on a high-stakes adventure.The laughs come often and feel genuine. Every character really comes to life once our stars take over inside ""Jumanji.""The fun pokes at 90s culture and video game aesthetics are well placed. There is a teaspoon of reminiscence for the original Jumanji but the movie is entirely its own. It is far from deep but touches on some lessons that are well-founded and agreeably useful for teenagers and pre-teens alike.","Jumanji",6988,3.1,-0.9
"6989",5,"  I took my daughters to this movie. We could not stop laughing the whole movie. We want to see another sequel. This is excellent family fun I recommend for anyone who wants a fun family night at the movies.","Jumanji",6989,3.1,-1.9
"6990",4.5,"  This was a very good & entertaining film","Jumanji",6990,3.1,-1.4
"6991",3.5,"  Possibly the most predictable film plot of all time, the terror of Jumanji is lost. Is it a bad movie however? Not at all. The awkward adaption to their unwanted heroism and urine handles makes the film warm and fun in an industry where everything doesn't have to be so bitter and serious. Would I pick it up on DVD? Probably not. Would I recommend a trip out to see it? Without a doubt. Just remember you're facilitating Dwayne's clear ambition to rule the planet. With Ready Player One and Tomb Raider on the way, it was nice to see a video game film which wasn't annihilated and it gives me hope for those to come.Jumanji's evolution in a struggle for survival and murder of children makes me wonder if a sequel as anything new to offer. Spencer and Martha's decision to return to reality however may have shot down an opportunity to drive a worthy of interest sequel. It was bloody funny though.7.4 / 10","Jumanji",6991,3.1,-0.4
"6992",5,"  Way better than the original.","Jumanji",6992,3.1,-1.9
"6993",4,"  Hilarious, Epic, Amusing, and Great Actors.","Jumanji",6993,3.1,-0.9
"6994",5,"  It respected the first one in the best way possible!","Jumanji",6994,3.1,-1.9
"6995",3.5,"  Far better than I thought it would be! If you're looking for a good laugh and something to take your mind of things for an hour or two, this film's a good de-stresser.","Jumanji",6995,3.1,-0.4
"6996",3,"  Good time at the movies - a popcorn flick worth seeing.","Jumanji",6996,3.1,0.1
"6997",3,"  Fun satisfying semi-sequel to the original. The idea is well done. Jack Black, Karen Gillian, Kevin Hart, and the Rock are all really good. They each have their moment to shine. It's a solid film, with a lot of laughs.","Jumanji",6997,3.1,0.1
"6998",5,"  To be fair, JUMANJI 2 is a much better, more cohesive, more coherent and more satisfying movie and also far more effective family fare, overall than JUSTICE LEAGUE & the new STAR WARS. Faint praise, to be sure but hey, it's factual.","Jumanji",6998,3.1,-1.9
"6999",4.5,"  An adventure for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.. Welcome to the Jungle. Jumanji is an adventurous comedy film featuring Dwayne Johnson (Spencer, Dr. Smolder Bravestone), Kevin Hart (Fridge, Franklin ""mouse"" Finbar), Jack Black (Bethany, Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon), and Karen Gillan (Martha, Ruby Roundhouse). When these four high school students are assigned detention together, they discover a video game called Jumanji. They get sucked into the game as the characters they chose with separate unique strengths and weaknesses along with three lives. The four are challenged by a stair case of levels and the only way to return home is to win the game. Director of Jumanji, Jake Kasdan, has also directed movies including: Zero Effect, Orange County, The TV Set, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher, and Sex Tape. Jumanji is extremely comical, the actors play out their characters very well. Jack Black, for example, plays the role of an self centered, vain teenaged girl and does a very good job. Also, there is a lot of action placed in the different levels putting you on the edge of your seat. However, there are some sexual jokes that complement as to why I would not recommend for viewers under age. Like the movie: The Jungle Book, the setting and scenery is absolutely beautiful. The humor and adventure is similar to that in Hook and Night at the Museum. I'd rate Jumanji four and a half out of five stars, so get your tickets before they sell out and try not to drink much soda.","Jumanji",6999,3.1,-1.4
"7000",4.5,"  SUPER entertaining and surprisingly original, this sequel to Jumanji is a LOT better than it has any right to be. Loved it!","Jumanji",7000,3.1,-1.4

"7003",3.5,"  In general, the film is insanely fun, a good solid laugh ride with some charming leads who work wonders with what they have. Even the stuff that doesn't quite work can still get a little chuckle just from the performances and the incredible set pieces. I expected this to be a total dud of a film, turns out it was pretty damn awesome","Jumanji",7003,3.1,-0.4
"7004",5,"  This movie is so FUNNY ??","Jumanji",7004,3.1,-1.9
"7005",5,"  My family absolutely loved this movie! Great references to the original! 5 stars!","Jumanji",7005,3.1,-1.9
"7006",4,"  Never thought I would say this since the fact that when I read the announcement and saw the cast for the film, I thought it was gonna be crap! And then I saw the Trailer and the title of the film and thought "" Aw fuck here we go another Ragnarok and Justice League 80's song pointless title"" Then a friend of mine dragged me to see it and I was very pleasantly surprised! ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" Is a very entertaining film! I really enjoyed the teen humor, the character arcs and the overall goofiness to the film. Also enjoyed that despite lurking in the shadows of the original it manages to be a good sequel but do it's own thing! although, Robin Williams is sadly missed...","Jumanji",7006,3.1,-0.9

"7012",5,"  Liked it better than the 1st film","Jumanji",7012,3.1,-1.9
"7013",5,"  Amazing movie! I loved the video game references, and how the movie does not take itself seriously at all. It's pure, unhinged adventure movie, with plenty of action, suspense, humour, and fun. Other than the occasional self-esteem seeking plot elements, and typical emotional drama, I absolutely loved this movie. A++","Jumanji",7013,3.1,-1.9

"7019",4,"  A great adventure and a of fun. All the main characters were great. Jack Black was probably the standout but as a Rock/Hart fan thought they were great together again","Jumanji",7019,3.1,-0.9
"7020",2.5,"  There are two things working in this film's favour: one is the nostalgic value attached to the 1995 original and the brand Jumanji - which, surprisingly and charmingly, is only updated here from the board game to a video game cartridge circa 1996 (but there's always the threequel, folks, for something more 2018) and the other is the simple premise of having well known actors/stars play against type - as in: what if Jack Black plays a self-obsessed girl or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays a nerd. And to this film's credit, they milked them to their fullest extent and manages quite a lot of mileage out of it. Unfortunately the rest of the film feels fairly by the book and the life lessons learnt are admirable but rather tame and unremarkable. The special effects are perfunctory, as are the cast of young unknowns and their more famous counterparts - everyone does a good job but nothing stands out as being particularly spectacular or exciting here. While the video game rules are played out in a consistently fun way and provides a clean and clear structure for the film to hang its set pieces on, the occasional sparks found in the half decent and amusing script might have worked better if they haven't been so overexposed for the trailers. In the end, this is undemanding fluff and manages just not to disappoint (or antagonize) too much in a situation where no one (except the creatively dried up studios) demands a sequel or a reboot but the audience is getting one anyway.","Jumanji",7020,3.1,0.6
"7021",4,"  They all did a great job, & I think this is kevin harts best role other than the one he did in the animated film.","Jumanji",7021,3.1,-0.9

"7025",4.5,"  Originally, I held no special desire to watch this film. Friendly overwhelming recommendations convinced me to watch it, and I certainly don't regret it. Humorous and enticing, the plot delivered far more than I expected. Not a minute passed that I was thoroughly entertained. The cast, stock-full of renowned and talented actors, helped to produce a film I would recommend to anyone. Exemplary.","Jumanji",7025,3.1,-1.4
"7026",5,"  This was by far one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. Jumanji kept you on the edge of your seat with the adventure while still making you laugh in almost every sentence that was said. This Jumanji was the best one I have seen so far. I would love to watch it again it was that good.","Jumanji",7026,3.1,-1.9
"7027",0.5,"  As a nerd, I find this movie insulting.Also as a fan of the original Jumanji, I find this movie bad as f*ck.","Jumanji",7027,3.1,2.6
"7028",5,"  It was better than TLJ","Jumanji",7028,3.1,-1.9
"7029",4,"  A blast with a great cast","Jumanji",7029,3.1,-0.9
"7030",2.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle failed to retain audience's attention more than the action scenes and trailer spoiling jokes.","Jumanji",7030,3.1,0.6
"7031",5,"  This movie was very good. I enjoyed the action and comedy in this film. All the actors really filled their roles and got to know their character. In my opinion Jack Black truly made me laugh, the way that he was able to act like Bethany was very impressive. I would no doubt see this movie any time you can.","Jumanji",7031,3.1,-1.9
"7032",4,"  Very enjoyable as it should be.","Jumanji",7032,3.1,-0.9
"7033",5,"  Hilarious, loved the original and I ALSO love this","Jumanji",7033,3.1,-1.9
"7034",3,"  It was ok but there's nothing like the original....but a good idea having a video game instead of board game!","Jumanji",7034,3.1,0.1
"7035",5,"  Jumanji Welcome to the jungle was awesome! HILARIOUS. I can't wait to see it again I cried laughing on a lot of the scenes. The entire theater had fun where i'm from.","Jumanji",7035,3.1,-1.9
"7036",2.5,"  Here's the thing with most average movies... In the end, you always end up at Point B. Along the journey, chances are that you might end up from Point A to Point C to Point B, but in the end, you will stand at Point B. A straight line is the fastest way to travel. A scientific theory known around the globe. That's the thing with movies. If the creators/directors just go from Point A straight to Point B, it is the fastest but also least captivating. Maybe the director will add some loops and twists and turns and maybe even backtrack a bit, but still, repeatedly I shall say, you shall end standing at Point B. So, since this movie falls straight into this average generalization, I'll give it an average rating...","Jumanji",7036,3.1,0.6
"7037",5,"  First I'd like to say this is NOT a remake or a reboot. It is a sequel that takes place in the same world that the original film did. The movie was great fun from start to finish. I go to the movies all the time and I've never had people in the audience laughing out loud the entire time. great action and humor. The Rock always entertains and it's worth it just to see Karen Gillan. It was a great cure for the Last Jedi blues.","Jumanji",7037,3.1,-1.9
"7038",4,"  Really fun movie, a nice restart for the franchise.","Jumanji",7038,3.1,-0.9
"7039",5,"  Just a well-done funny movie. I laughed a lot more than I expected to!","Jumanji",7039,3.1,-1.9
"7040",4.5,"  Jumanji was pretty good. Dwayne Johnson does not get enough credit for his acting. While he may look like Dwayne Johnson. He's a surprisingly versatile actor. He's funny, charming & his comedic timing is great. He really convinces you he's played by a teenage nerd. He is not your typical tough guy action hero. Also Karen Gillan but the person who stood out the most was Jack Black playing his teenage role as Bethany. Too hilarious!","Jumanji",7040,3.1,-1.4
"7041",4.5,"  I decided to see Jumanji since I'm a fan of the Rock and Karen Gillan. It's entertaining. Nothing to debate, nothing thought provoking, nothing to over analyze. Its just lighthearted entertainment and sometimes that's all that's needed.","Jumanji",7041,3.1,-1.4
"7042",5,"  Jumanji was a fantastic. For anyone one thinks this was just a cash grab, you'll get your moneys worth. Don't listen to the bitter people, this is something new and enjoyable that the entire family will enjoy. One of the best movie of the year so far. Can't wait to buy it on blu-ray.","Jumanji",7042,3.1,-1.9
"7043",4,"  Pretty good movie and quite funny. I enjoyed it","Jumanji",7043,3.1,-0.9
"7044",4.5,"  Although i'm big fan of Dwayne The Rock Johnson, I was skeptical of seeing Jumanji at 1st but it turned out to be one of the funnest movies I've seen in a while.","Jumanji",7044,3.1,-1.4
"7045",4.5,"  Jumani: Welcome To The Jungle works because of the great cast, the chemistry between them and some gut-busting laughs. If you are looking for a movie that will entertain you no matter what your age is you will most likely have a good time with this movie. The film also contains some really cool action sequences that I wasn't expecting.","Jumanji",7045,3.1,-1.4
"7046",4,"  Fun movie, no crap no sex no dirty language","Jumanji",7046,3.1,-0.9
"7047",5,"  Very colorful film & the cast was chosen perfectly.","Jumanji",7047,3.1,-1.9
"7048",2,"  Overhyped. Kind of dumb. And the secondary characters are there just to kill them. No reason - just supposed to kill them.","Jumanji",7048,3.1,1.1
"7049",4.5,"  Not a single dull part to this movie. From the minute they got into the game they to the time they left.","Jumanji",7049,3.1,-1.4
"7050",4.5,"  This movie was hilarious!","Jumanji",7050,3.1,-1.4
"7051",4.5,"  This was a fun movie. Jack Black was the best, he is so funny. I went with my friends and family for my birthday and we all enjoyed the movie. I must admit I had my doubts it would be good because I was a big Robin Williams fan. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's also a great movie because there is no foul language, & everyone keeps their clothes on. It just shows that you can make a great comedy in this day and age without dropping an ""F"" bomb every five minutes. I say go to see this movie, get yourself a big bag of popcorn and coke and relax, forget the world outside and just laugh! and laugh hard it will do you a world of good.","Jumanji",7051,3.1,-1.4
"7052",2,"  Dumb and even boring at times the movie was a big disappointment...","Jumanji",7052,3.1,1.1
"7053",4.5,"  One of 2017's best films. Loved that it picked up right where the 1995 version left off. Amazing cast, tons of hilarious moments, & great chemistry.","Jumanji",7053,3.1,-1.4
"7054",5,"  The rock and kevin hart work perfectly together!","Jumanji",7054,3.1,-1.9
"7055",4,"  A fun movie recommended for everyone. A surprisingly solid storyline with tons of laughs. Not to mention, Jack Black's acting is hilarious and fantastic as portrays a high school girl trapped in a grown man's body.","Jumanji",7055,3.1,-0.9
"7056",5,"  Don't get mad that Jumanji Welcome To The Jungle is doing better than a film you liked. This was a really good movie.","Jumanji",7056,3.1,-1.9
"7057",5,"  Great movie. I loved how the character evolved but not so drastically that it made the entire adventure cheesy.","Jumanji",7057,3.1,-1.9
"7058",1.5,"  It?s just one of those movies you wonder why are you still watching, hoping for something that you already know it won?t come... if it was played on Netflix I would just turn it off after the first 30min or less. Humor is super dry and silly, acting sooo bad, story dumb... I really don?t see pretty much anything interesting in it at all","Jumanji",7058,3.1,1.6
"7059",4.5,"  Take it for what it is...a good action/adventure fantasy movie that lets you just enjoy yourself. Sure there's a few plot holes but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I like movies for what they are, and I thought this movie was just a lot of fun from beginning to end. And in my opinon, it was honestly better than the newest Star Wars","Jumanji",7059,3.1,-1.4
"7060",3.5,"  Hysterical! Jumanji is THE film that made me laugh the hardest in 2017. It was surprising entertaining and outrageous, thanks to the incredibly funny ensemble cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. Karen Gillan was superb. The story played on teenage angst and first world problems - like mobile phones and computer games. I died watching Jack Black as a teenage girl, and Dwayne Johnson discovering ""smouldering"" and muscles as a nerdy teen. A fun film, though there were parts where the pace was uneven. I'm sure Sony is all smiles with another new franchise in hand. Here's to better scripts and better story telling, and lots of laughs.","Jumanji",7060,3.1,-0.4
"7061",5,"  Well structured, tight plot, great cast, and funny. Very very funny!","Jumanji",7061,3.1,-1.9
"7062",3,"  Pretty poor movie, but The Rock and Kevin Hart are just too good.","Jumanji",7062,3.1,0.1
"7063",4.5,"  Lol at kevin hart stole the show. He is the same in every movie. Loud with a potty mouth, Jack Black, Dwayne & KAren acually convinced you they were playing their characters and there were some really cool fight sequences in this film.","Jumanji",7063,3.1,-1.4
"7064",2.5,"  Fun movie but it all felt pointless","Jumanji",7064,3.1,0.6
"7065",3.5,"  Although it wasn't my favorite it was action packed and a lot of fun definitely a family movie.","Jumanji",7065,3.1,-0.4
"7066",0.5,"  I have not seen this film.","Jumanji",7066,3.1,2.6
"7067",3.5,"  Fun movie, lots of well crafted humour. Jack Black and Kevin Hart stole the show.","Jumanji",7067,3.1,-0.4
"7068",4,"  actually good, isn't trying to be a remake of the original. actually stands on its own two feet. ,","Jumanji",7068,3.1,-0.9
"7069",4,"  Thrilling, entertaining, and a must see comedy! One of the better movies in an overwhelmingly disappointing Christmas period.","Jumanji",7069,3.1,-0.9
"7070",3,"  Fun film to watch with family and friends that is fairly original in premise, but reuses alot of the same jokes through the film.","Jumanji",7070,3.1,0.1
"7071",5,"  If you aren't giving this 5-stars then you must not have watched it. Go back and see it again. This is what an action movie is supposed to be.","Jumanji",7071,3.1,-1.9
"7072",5,"  Fantastic movie, i loved it way more than i expected to. Better than the original in every single way in my opinion","Jumanji",7072,3.1,-1.9
"7073",4.5,"  Not as bad as you'd think would be. Jack Black did not act like Jack Black playing a woman, he just acted like a teenage woman. I think he really did his homework with this role. I think the director spent most of his time trying to get Dwayne to act like a scared boy but he just couldn't deliver it. I like Dwayne Johnson but he needs to really step up his acting game if he wants to play none ""The Rock"" rolls. When he needed to be tuff in the movie, he was and he did it very well. But I just didn't believe he was a scared teen as much as Jack Black. Karen Gillan did very well but I think the director left her alone. She did what she could with what she had read about the role. Kevin Hart also did very well well but his character just wasn't explored very much so nothing ventured nothing gained.The story was an excellent update as well as sequel to the original coming of age 1995 version. It works as a meta-comedy of video games without eliminating the emersion of the movie. It's got plenty of action thrown in (as expected given the story) without making you think you're watching an action movie. There's a quick romance shoe-horned in but that's kind of a requirement of any coming of age film. The superb acting of Jack Black (haven't said that in a while) helped a lot with some of the bad writing. Kevin Hart's goofy line towards the end he had to say was covered up by a well-earned meta joke about video game's typically bad writing. Again, nothing ventured, nothing gained in Kevin's acting. Not bad, but not good.All and all, I'd say its worth watching on Netflix for sure, but I wouldn't pay for it in a theater unless you're a fan of the original storyline and really want to see the sequel. Which I am, and I did. As a quick and final note, props to whoever let Karen throw in the Doctor Who reference. Yawzah!","Jumanji",7073,3.1,-1.4
"7074",4,"  Just good fun is what it is!","Jumanji",7074,3.1,-0.9
"7075",4.5,"  Y no le tenía casi nada de fe","Jumanji",7075,3.1,-1.4
"7076",3.5,"  The film has a lot of charm and hilarious characters but the one thing I hate with this long belated sequels is the lack of story. This is a recycle of the first films plot line, right down to the first character being sucked into the game, surely they could have come up with another plot device after twenty years. I enjoyed the Van Pelt being redesigned for the film, that is an interesting choice for the franchise and means a new actor can be cast if a sequel is required. I think the filmmakers could attempt VR for the sequel but the board game is where the true franchise idea lies. The film is fun and will appeal to family and kids but don't go looking for any great depth of character as this is very run of the mill stuff here. 08-01-2018.","Jumanji",7076,3.1,-0.4
"7077",3.5,"  The chemistry between the Rock and Kevin Hart makes this movie enjoyable.","Jumanji",7077,3.1,-0.4
"7078",4,"  fun and entertaining","Jumanji",7078,3.1,-0.9
"7079",4,"  Very hilarious movie filled with colorful cinematograhy and intense action sequences.","Jumanji",7079,3.1,-0.9
"7080",3,"  Good popcorn movie. Better than The Last Jedi.","Jumanji",7080,3.1,0.1
"7081",4,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun family flick. It is extremely funny and is a great evolution of the original. If it tried to undo or completely remake the 1995 Jumanji I would be singing a different tune, but instead Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle simply modernizes a kid's classic. The movie lacks the original's darkness and sense of danger, but does its job holding the audience's attention with great cast chemistry and some solid humor. It gives audiences a fun relaxing ride that the whole family can enjoy.","Jumanji",7081,3.1,-0.9
"7082",4.5,"  Very funny film. Loved that awkward kiss scene between martha and spencer.. I was crying.","Jumanji",7082,3.1,-1.4
"7083",3.5,"  Original jumani meets the mummy meets Indiana Jones in this action packed comedy. Lots of funny moments, one liners throughout and it looked like the actors had a great time filming it. You could compare it to the original and the original was a great film. This is well worth going to see, very enjoyable","Jumanji",7083,3.1,-0.4
"7084",5,"  Awesome movie and very funny. Great job by all the cast. It's been number one for 2 weeks in a row after dethroning the Last Jedi. I will definitely by the bluray.","Jumanji",7084,3.1,-1.9
"7085",5,"  It was way better than I thought it would be. Jack Black was great","Jumanji",7085,3.1,-1.9
"7086",3,"  Fun and funny. Weird penis jokes distract from humor, but still a good time with the family.","Jumanji",7086,3.1,0.1
"7087",4.5,"  Was skeptical going in, remake of Jumanji? Are we really trying to outdo Robin Williams. I was pleasantly surprised. It managed to deliver on a newer version of the movie without leaning too hard on the original. The cast was great and the movie was very funny. Jack Black stole the show as teenage girl. Fun popcorn flick.","Jumanji",7087,3.1,-1.4
"7088",4,"  i have watched both star wars and jumanji but if someone asks to watch again either one of them, i will choose jumanji!! a sequel after 22 years, but yet it never seems like the gap between these 2 affected much!! specially the whole cast and the story were very good!! Jack Black and Karen Gillan were incredible!! But Kevin Hart steals the show!! every single moment it was soooo thrilling and entertaining!! the connection between two jumanji was minimal but it was there.. overall a complete entertainment package!!","Jumanji",7088,3.1,-0.9
"7089",4.5,"  Was funny, entertaining and the jokes were pretty good. I'd like to see the continuation with The Rock, Jack, Karen and Hart, like trying to escape from Jumanji or something like that.","Jumanji",7089,3.1,-1.4
"7090",4,"  Very funny, very well done.It would be better if they didn't swear as much. There was no need for it","Jumanji",7090,3.1,-0.9
"7091",5,"  After having experienced Jumanji brought into our world as a child, nostalgia was what led me to this sequel. What followed was a hilarious and riveting adventure inside the world we only saw glimpses of so long ago. Fun watch whether you've seen the first or not.","Jumanji",7091,3.1,-1.9
"7092",3.5,"  Jumanji was a pleasant surprise overall. Funny, heart warming and adventurous with Jack Black stealing the show.","Jumanji",7092,3.1,-0.4

"7099",5,"  It is a amazing film it has inspired me to come put and tell my peronts that i am gay. It is the nest film that i have seen in a long time.","Love Simon",7099,3.8,-1.2
"7100",4,"  A great coming of age story focusing on a gay teen, that shows the struggles of being in the closet and coming out to friends and family in a great way. I love the LGBT representation in this and the movie itself is a great mix of funny and emotional. Definitely recommend seeing it!","Love Simon",7100,3.8,-0.2
"7101",4.5,"  This movie was nice without being overly saccharine. Hufflepuff-esque one might say. Hitting all the right notes, Love, Simon showcases an accurate interpretation of a young gay adolescent; from the way that Simon's attention quickly jumps from potential suitor to potential suitor or his aptly decorated room and penchant for Panic! At The Disco.However, this movie's lack of.. anything, lack of advertising and lack of flair, leaves it stuck in the middle with little development of the characters. The characters, while relatable and each woven easily into the narrative are almost two dimensional, flat and limp on the screen. This two dimensionality of the characters fortunately, does not take away from the general enjoyment of the film and the director seemed to be striving for a film about the average and has achieved his goal.My one wish for this film? More screen time for the main love interest. Spoiler alert. Bram, who turns out to be Blue lacks dialogue or any meaningful connection with Simon. It is heavily implied that they have spent time together off screen but apart from a drunken montage together, they barely see each other.In conclusion, great movie but not the one to watch if you're looking for depth and meaning and metaphors. Enjoyable, light hearted but still touching on serious issues. A must see for any LGBT+ teen.Kudos to Greg Berlanti for adding just a touch more diversity to Hollywood's white washed, overplayed, heterosexual rom-com scene.","Love Simon",7101,3.8,-0.7
"7102",5,"  A very nice movie indeed. Made me feel ""Gay""! Yay!","Love Simon",7102,3.8,-1.2
"7103",4,"  Really good. Saw it with my husband (and without our teenage daughter) and we both liked it quite a bit. I'm a sucker for a good ending.","Love Simon",7103,3.8,-0.2
"7104",5,"  Love, Simon is just what has been needed for awhile now and it does what other movies in this genre hasn't really been able to achieve. It's a feel good movie that will make you laugh, cry, and make you leave the theater feeling there's some good in the world. And who wouldn't want Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Gardner as your mom and dad?","Love Simon",7104,3.8,-1.2
"7105",4,"  Great all around movie","Love Simon",7105,3.8,-0.2

"7110",5,"  I loved this film so much. I could relate to it on many levels as an openly gay teen. My coming out is still happening 5 years after my big 'outing' and this movie has brought up so many emotions I didn't think I'd have to face again. Anger, sadness and joy. These emotions being produced by this film shows to all that the representation of the LGBT community is not only there but very nearly perfect. Thankyou cast and producers for this truly wonderful film.","Love Simon",7110,3.8,-1.2
"7111",5,"  best movie I have ever seen. i never realized how little i related to couples on screen untill simon kissed Blue and I, and the ENTIRE theater erupted in screaming and clapping and tears. this is the most I have ever trully FELT a movie and its just so important.","Love Simon",7111,3.8,-1.2

"7115",5,"  Amazing, funny , emotional. The best film I've seen all year . Possibly an all time favourite.","Love Simon",7115,3.8,-1.2
"7116",5,"  This film is amazing. The story is so important in todays society, it is one that needs to be portrayed to a mass audience and thankfully it has, lets hope that audiences give back and go and see it. It's got hilarious moments, touching moments, moments you want to shout out at the screen, moments that make you cry, and most importantly, moments that make you think. Maybe I am biased as someone who is a gay teen, but I feel like this film has something for everybody, whilst giving such an important voice the LGBTQ community. One of the best films I have ever seen.","Love Simon",7116,3.8,-1.2
"7117",5,"  This movie was freaking amazing, it was perfect in every aspect! I loved the development of characters, the suspense in some parts, and just the overall romantic aspect of it. It was so beautiful and I hope there is a sequel as the director teased. Love, Simon is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time!!!!","Love Simon",7117,3.8,-1.2
"7118",5,"  This made me cry so many times. It truly is beautiful.","Love Simon",7118,3.8,-1.2
"7119",5,"  A fantastic, happy coming-of-age LGBT movie that I think teens today deserve. It's not about the hard, scary struggle that many can relate to, but it's the romcom with representation that I wish I could have had when I was young. Well written, AMAZINGLY acted, and genuine throughout.","Love Simon",7119,3.8,-1.2
"7120",5,"  Best movie I've seen this year, not close. Start to finish i was into the film. Great message and just an overall awesome film.","Love Simon",7120,3.8,-1.2
"7121",3.5,"  A sweet coming out story that normalizes being gay, however, hits some standard beats in the coming-of-age genre and occasionally forces sentimentality upon its subjects. The representation and joy the film depicts makes up for its overall lack of nuance. Let there be more pictures like Love, Simon, and hopefully in the future, add some subtlety. What we have now, though is a film that could ease the pain of many teenagers and those who see themselves in Simon's plight, and help them accept who they are. Rating: 71","Love Simon",7121,3.8,0.3
"7122",5,"  So far my favourite movie ever. Robinson was absolutely stunning as were Langford, Shipp, Garner and Duhamel. Katherine Langford has come to be my favourite actress in the current moment and her portrayal as Simon's best friend Leah was amazing. The script was very well done and quite tight as well. The directing was great and overall loved it. 10/10, would recommend.","Love Simon",7122,3.8,-1.2
"7123",5,"  Love, Simon was a very well directed movie. It was a heart-warming film that showed the true struggle of coming out and being gay. This is well composed, and is a lovely representation of how unfair gay lives are. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would definitely do so. A big thank you to the producers of this amazing movie.","Love Simon",7123,3.8,-1.2
"7124",3.5,"  A fun and refreshing take on the coming-of-age tale. A great introduction into a topic that isn't addressed enough and that is done in a fun and safe way. 'Love, Simon' will make you smile.","Love Simon",7124,3.8,0.3
"7125",3.5,"  Simon is a sociable and normal looking 17-year-old, he has a close-knit group of friends at school, a loving and liberal-minded family at home, but he is carrying a huge burden on his young shoulders. Not that he hasn?t told anyone he is gay and is corresponding anonymously online with another closeted school mate but that he?s a lead character in a studio picture who happens to be gay. One can only imagine the expectations and what will happen if this film does not perform. Thankfully, we have a smart and breezy script that normalizes the coming out process and treats it as just another adolescent experience like having your first kiss, or discovering one?s sexuality, whether it is straight, gay or otherwise undefined. Less rom-com but more a coming of age drama with an element of romantic mystery as Simon tries to find out the secret identity of the person he is sharing his most personal inner feelings with, this is an extremely likeable film with an equally likeable lead. Greg Berlanti?s direction is solid and he steers the film away from either being too heavy or too twee. For the most part, the script feels real and believable, with more than a few good zingers spread around for maximum comedic effect. The cast is good-looking and charming/inoffensive enough to appeal to an audience outside the niche queer cinema crowd. Mission accomplished then? Probably, but the coming out of mainstream Hollywood Cinema is only beginning and hopefully the positive critical response and box office will mean that we can have more enjoyable LGBTQ+ films that doesn?t have to be serious (Moonlight), arty (Call Me By Your Name) or tragic (Brokeback Mountain) in order to get noticed or seen.","Love Simon",7125,3.8,0.3
"7126",5,"  These days it isn't often that I watch a movie that truly touched my soul. Love, Simon is the kind of film that's funny, sensitive, brave and above all else hopeful. It's the kind of film you want to watch again straight after the credits roll. Every character had an important role to play. The parents, the teachers, the peers, they are all necessary in telling this story, which more than anything is a love story. I'm calling it right now this is the best film of the year and I'll even go as far as saying it's now in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. If you only watch one movie this year let it be this one. I promise you won't regret it.","Love Simon",7126,3.8,-1.2
"7127",2.5,"  I really enjoy the movie, especially the first part. But I don't know why, I felt disconnected with the second part... I have no prejudice and I loved ""Call me by your name"". But here, something is still missing... It's a very good movie, just not a great one!","Love Simon",7127,3.8,1.3
"7128",3.5,"  It is more of a teenage movie instead of a gay one. Most of the audience in my session were teenage girls. I guess most of gay teenage boys were still in the deep closet. The setting of the whole movie is way too ideal including understanding and progressive parents, loyal friends, responsible and caring teachers, friendly schoolmates and a good-looking masculine Caucasian main character from an upper middle-class family. In addition, I would be curious aout what would happen if mysterious Mr. Blue were an average-looking chubby Asian guy. Would the fina kiss be able to happen as well? Anyway, it is a good movie but definitely not on the same level with 'Call Me by Your Name'.","Love Simon",7128,3.8,0.3
"7129",5,"  Amazing movie and relates with my own history.","Love Simon",7129,3.8,-1.2
"7130",3.5,"  Solid balance of humor contrasts nicely with some of the heavier elements. Provides a fresher approach to what many will recognize as a well worn genre.","Love Simon",7130,3.8,0.3
"7131",4,"  A great teen movie that is enjoyable for older audiences. Well written and acted.","Love Simon",7131,3.8,-0.2
"7132",5,"  I knew this was gonna be a tear jerker to some extent, and definitely was. It is sweet, funny, sad, and heart wrenching. This is a movie I will be purchasing so that i can watch it over and over.","Love Simon",7132,3.8,-1.2
"7133",4,"  First off, I loved this movie. As an LGBTQ+ teen, many aspects really hit home. Dealing with your sexuality an gender can be really difficult. Yes, this movie is cliche. Yes, this movie is made for teens. But the thing is is that it's good at these things. You don't see too many movies that can pull off having stereotypical elements while having them be impactful. Although the movie does involve many elements of inclusion, there could have been steps that could have been made to make it more inclusive. One of them is having an LGBTQ+ actor in the main role. Another is (spoiler) not making the Friend of color have all of the family problems. ANOTHER is not having the main character be in a rich white suburb with a steady life and progressive parents. This is basically if everything had gone right for anybody. Now let's get into it. Being outed sucks. Many non-LGBTQ+ people look over that aspect of the movie, but it's one of the largest fears of many in the community. I was outed by my mom to my dad. It sucked. I wasn't ready. Of course, that wasn't the same scale as in the movie, so I can only imagine how Simon felt. Many non-LGBTQ+ people loved this movie, which is good, but many will never understand how it truly feels. Overall Love, Simon was an amazing movie even if it didn't deal with everything in the way it should have","Love Simon",7133,3.8,-0.2
"7134",5,"  If you want to see how coming out is a shitty process, this film shows how it actually is. Humor-filled, the drama is just okay. The flow of the film is awesome. Well-deserved for an applause after!","Love Simon",7134,3.8,-1.2
"7135",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing. The camera movement, set design, lighting, and filter of the set were perfectly set. Each shot that was taken of the characters- more specifically Simon- captured not only his outer emotions, but his inner emotions as well. As for the plot, it was absolutely fantastic. Even in 2018, an LGBT movie was well needed for teenagers. This movie has brought a lot of confidence upon many many teens throughout not only America, but the entire world. It is a must-have-to-see movie.","Love Simon",7135,3.8,-1.2
"7136",5,"  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Many LGBT love stories are tradgedies that can damage young LGBT people's views of being LGBT and out. Young people shouldn't be afraid of being gay. The truth is that the life of an LGBT person isn't tragic and that we, like Simon, are just like you.","Love Simon",7136,3.8,-1.2
"7137",5,"  Truly an amazing movie that sent me on an emotional rollercoaster. Was laughing one moment and crying the next. Beautiful concept that was pull off greatly. As a teenager, It's great to see the movie industry coming out (no pu intended) with more diverse films, especially including the LGBT community. Would recommend everyone to watch and will definitely be seeing again.","Love Simon",7137,3.8,-1.2
"7138",5,"  Made in a way that makes this a family movie. Wonderfully done!","Love Simon",7138,3.8,-1.2
"7139",5,"  Great movie! Adorable love story and a nice experience for the whole family. It was great for mine :)","Love Simon",7139,3.8,-1.2
"7140",4.5,"  A relatable story that has been waiting to be shared. Although coming out may be easy for Simon compared to others this is a story about owning your own identity in your own way and time.","Love Simon",7140,3.8,-0.7
"7141",5,"  This is honestly the best movie I've ever seen.","Love Simon",7141,3.8,-1.2
"7142",4.5,"  A fun, yet moving, coming of age tale.","Love Simon",7142,3.8,-0.7
"7143",5,"  I loved it so much I balled my eyes out and wish that it was around when I came out.","Love Simon",7143,3.8,-1.2
"7144",5,"  This movie holds such a special place in my heart. I, being gay, was gery excited about this movie, and I was not dissapointed in the slightest. The movie captures the feelings of both coming out and being outed so well, and I couldn't help but audibly sob multiple time in the theater. The romance was spot on and lived up to it's source. Highly recommend!","Love Simon",7144,3.8,-1.2
"7145",5,"  i wish i could give this movie a higher rating that it deserves","Love Simon",7145,3.8,-1.2
"7146",5,"  Truly one of the best films I've seen ever. Beautiful story line.","Love Simon",7146,3.8,-1.2
"7147",5,"  Watch it. Go see it with your partner, go see it with your kids, go see it with your friends, go see it by yourself. Just go see it.","Love Simon",7147,3.8,-1.2
"7148",4,"  A really fun and interesting film.The acting, especially from the main characters, is good. The film has a good message about being open. The only complaint is that the writing is terrible at some parts of the film. People talk not like people. Overall, it was enjoyable. 8/10","Love Simon",7148,3.8,-0.2
"7149",5,"  Very enjoyable love story.","Love Simon",7149,3.8,-1.2
"7150",5,"  I couldn't help but smile during pretty much the whole movie.","Love Simon",7150,3.8,-1.2
"7151",5,"  A fantastic film built for the modern age. It inspires all generations to be proud of who they are and accept themselves. It also communicates strong positive messages and ideas.","Love Simon",7151,3.8,-1.2
"7152",5,"  My queer heart cried itself out several times, and I never really cry. I related so much to Simon and his struggles in coming out and self-acceptance. I never realized how much I needed a gay romcom until I saw this, and this is maybe the only romcom I'll ever watch. SO GOOD.","Love Simon",7152,3.8,-1.2
"7153",5,"  It is a movie where we can feel the way of a each persons who can say anything about how they feeling and express theyselfs.","Love Simon",7153,3.8,-1.2
"7154",4.5,"  It does everything it set out to do. Top acting and soundtrack gives it some rewatchability if you like crying.","Love Simon",7154,3.8,-0.7
"7155",4.5,NA,"Love Simon",7155,3.8,-0.7
"7156",5,"  Absolutely one of my favorite films by far. Not much can make me shed a tear, but this movie has accomplished that. It's moreover due to the fact that it is a relatable source of raw feelings and emtion for those in the LGBTQ community.","Love Simon",7156,3.8,-1.2
"7157",5,"  Such a great movie. Loved every minute of it and was very emotional!","Love Simon",7157,3.8,-1.2
"7158",4.5,"  so far the best movie I've seen in 2018.","Love Simon",7158,3.8,-0.7
"7159",4,"  Very fun and cute film.There are two sides to this move. There is the story of a kids coming to terms with himself and the there is a story of teenage friendship. I'm a sucker for teen/coming of age film. This film felt very much like a modern-day Brat Pack or movie from the Not Another Teen Movie era. Even aside from the ""gay side"" it was a very cute story about high school life. There is a bit of a mystery to it too, which was cute. It's very touching. Highly recommend if you're not a trump-loving homophobe.","Love Simon",7159,3.8,-0.2
"7160",5,"  Wonderful, moving, sad, funny, happy and likely a fairly accurate portrayal in many ways. One of the best films in a long time.","Love Simon",7160,3.8,-1.2
"7161",5,"  Made my gay heart beat fastert","Love Simon",7161,3.8,-1.2
"7162",5,"  Incredible, highly reccomend. The movie was the perfect mix of heart wrenching and hilarious. Very much needed for the LGBTQA+ community.","Love Simon",7162,3.8,-1.2
"7163",4.5,"  ""Love, Simon"" is a sweet, overdue addition to that old Hollywood warhorse, the teen coming-of-age movie. The twist, such as it is, is that the lead character (played wonderfully by Nick Robinson) is gay and in equal parts eager and terrified to tell anyone about it. The parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) are what every gay teen's parents should be (but aren't). The only other adults in the story are the vice principal (Tony Hale, always fun) and a drama teacher (Natasha Rothwell, refreshing). But this is a story about teenagers and, appropriately, they are front in center. The actors portraying the teens are uniformly excellent, especially Robinson and Logan Miller (playing a jerk who is a romantic but mostly a jerk). Maybe (hopefully) we'll reach a point some day where this film looks quaint and dated. That day has not yet come. ""Love, Simon"" may not be the greatest film ever made, but it's a strong and necessary one.","Love Simon",7163,3.8,-0.7
"7164",5,"  I love this movie so much!! It genuinely gives the feeling of what it's like to be closeted in a potentially hostile environment and not knowing whether you can come out or not.","Love Simon",7164,3.8,-1.2
"7165",5,"  Was a beautiful movie. It didn't feel fake or over sexualized just a honest love story that young lgbtq+ teens and adults need to see and be proud of.","Love Simon",7165,3.8,-1.2
"7166",5,"  Bless this movie. I've never cried so hard it laughed so much in recent memory. I can't wait to see it again...","Love Simon",7166,3.8,-1.2
"7167",5,"  This film answers the question: what would it look like if John Hughes made a teen film about coming out of the closet and finding love with the same-sex? ""Love, Simon"" harkens back to the days of the 80's teen comedy with its quirkily charming characters and a firm grasp of its time featuring plot points teenagers of the day will recognize as part of their everyday lives such as the usage of social media. With that in mind, its inspiration is clear, but it also boasts an interesting story audiences of all demographics can love and relate to as well as a stellar cast of newcomers to watch our for. Overall, ""Love, Simon"" is a triumph in making LGBT storylines like this not only more available, but also more relatable to younger audiences.","Love Simon",7167,3.8,-1.2
"7168",4.5,"  Art is powerful. Good Art allows you to walk in another's shoes. This movie is Good Art and it's message allowed me to walk in Simon's shoes.","Love Simon",7168,3.8,-0.7
"7169",5,"  Loved it...what a beautiful movie","Love Simon",7169,3.8,-1.2
"7170",5,"  Today, I watched ""Love, Simon."" I have never, ever wrote any review like this before, but the movie compels me to go this far.Before I say anything else, I am gay, and I watched the film with my best friend (female). The movie sets you up for a whirlwind of emotions, to describe it differently than the exact image it gives you in the beginning. I smiled; I laughed; I cried. ""Love, Simon"" spoke to me on multiple emotional and personal levels. I mean, wow. Just wow. And to have my best friend with me too is just priceless. Absolutely priceless.The movie itself is filled to the brim with relatable moments, sudden twists, situational irony, constant mystery, and loveable, loveable characters. I could not find any wrong with the movie, nor will I dare to attempt to.The theatre will be sure to laugh, gasp, shout, and weep with you. Some folks like me ought to be a tad bit louder. As shy as I am though, I was fine to show my extra love for ""Love, Simon"" through stifled giggles and sniffles (thus resulting in the occasional snort).""Love, Simon"" is for everybody. It exposes so many truths about what such a situation is, and it has many more themes ribboned in with the storyline. From friends, to love, to parents, to school, to introverts, to stress, to awkwardness, and to more and more, ""Love, Simon"" accurately portrays so many ""that's me"" moments.I give my greatest thanks and appreciation to the author of ""Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda"" (which I broke my rule with, by not reading the book first), the cast, and the entire crew who made this possible.Thank you ""Love, Simon"" for making my day. Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for bonding my friend and I (even more). And thank you for giving me solace with who I am. As said before, I am gay. And now, typing it like this gives me tingles from the movie.","Love Simon",7170,3.8,-1.2
"7171",5,"  IT'S BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE AND IS SO WORTH WATCHING.This movie will make you feel so emotional and I can so relate to it. It's just so adorable and it's so well crafted. I love it :)","Love Simon",7171,3.8,-1.2

"7173",4.5,"  This is an adorable, hilarious, and emotional movie about a closeted gay kid who sees a post from an <3 anonymous other closeted kay kid at his same school <3 and they start emailing, anonymously, each other about their lives. This film is near perfect with its wonderful characters, stunning soundtrack, and John Hughes style direction. Warning: it takes you through a roller coaster of feelings.","Love Simon",7173,3.8,-0.7

"7176",0.5,"  Being gay is a trendy popular thing to do right now, almost like getting a tattoo. This movie is another attempt to normalize gay relationships. Help me!","Love Simon",7176,3.8,3.3
"7177",0.5,"  I felt so misled by the glowing reviews I've read thus far. This was the cheesiest crap I've seen in a long time. It was Disney or ABC Family level.","Love Simon",7177,3.8,3.3
"7178",5,"  Such a great movie. Favorite movie of all time.","Love Simon",7178,3.8,-1.2

"7181",5,"  This movie means so much. My review would be too long, but suffice it to say I cried several times and I'm immediately saw it again the next day with my partner. Truly amazing.","Love Simon",7181,3.8,-1.2
"7182",5,NA,"Love Simon",7182,3.8,-1.2
"7183",5,"  Todays experience with watching the movie ""Love?Simon"" was so heart touching. It talked about a closeted guy who came out of closet in high school. This was the first movie to make me cry that much?because I can deeply feel all the difficulties the main character had gone through and how hard it is to live with it and be open about it. Thanks for making this movie Fox Studio?????","Love Simon",7183,3.8,-1.2
"7184",5,"  I cried for the last 20 minutes. What a heartwarming film! It was great to see Generation Z up on the screen. Their tech and nerd references XD very funny and entertaining. It was easy to identify with the characters even if you've never been in their situations. Good coming-of-age story.","Love Simon",7184,3.8,-1.2
"7185",5,"  This movie was absolutely beautiful and inspiring I saw this movie today and I kid you not, it made me cry 5 times and makes me feel accepted as a lesbian.","Love Simon",7185,3.8,-1.2
"7186",5,"  This movie is sweet, funny, and beautiful. It's the first of it's genre to perfectly capture what it's like to be a closeted gay teen. Gay teens of the modern world have been waiting for like this. Bravo to the creative team.","Love Simon",7186,3.8,-1.2
"7187",5,"  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! I've never seen a movie this good in forever. I cried I laughed and I feel in love with this story. Thank you to the creators!","Love Simon",7187,3.8,-1.2
"7188",5,"  its honestly my favorite movie some parts were a little unbelievable but its a high school Rom com so what do you expect","Love Simon",7188,3.8,-1.2
"7189",5,"  So many actors buying out theatres in small and large cities to open it to the public. Best coming of age which happens to be coming out film, loved the coming out as straight scenes, Very funny! I laughed! Rare in a modern comedy.","Love Simon",7189,3.8,-1.2
"7190",0.5,"  Waste of time and money! A huge flop! Sorry, but the story line is predictable and boring!","Love Simon",7190,3.8,3.3

"7193",5,"  What an amazing was to introduce a rom com but in the perspective of a closeted young man. So glad we have this movie now.","Love Simon",7193,3.8,-1.2
"7194",2.5,"  A noble purpose, but still just a teen love movie about a straight boy (who happens to like other boys?)","Love Simon",7194,3.8,1.3
"7195",5,"  If John Hughes had made a film with a gay lead character, this would be it. Love, Simon is funny, touching, with all you expect in a coming of age film. Simon Spier is gay, but no one knows. How he navigates his feelings, and deals with all a high schooler deals with is amazing. I can't speak highly enough about this film.","Love Simon",7195,3.8,-1.2
"7196",4.5,"  love it so much, the book is great and so is the movie in a separate way.","Love Simon",7196,3.8,-0.7
"7197",0.5,"  I saw this film based on the strong critic and audience ratings. For me, it fell flat and I came close to walking out. There was no depth or heart in the story or the characters, even though they tried.","Love Simon",7197,3.8,3.3
"7198",4.5,"  Even though Love, Simon was a bit corny at times, it was a good coming of age movie, and was the first I have ever seen to tell the story in the perspective of someone who is struggling to come out in High School. I feel like it was more relatable than most movies that try to discuss the topic of sexual orientation in society because it doesn't rely on that discussion as it's only element of storytelling. In other words, for this type of teenage romantic comedy, it doesn't make it seem abnormal for the plot to focus around someone who is gay. The score by Rob Simonsen was also very fitting and the special sound he brought made the movie even more enjoyable to watch.","Love Simon",7198,3.8,-0.7
"7199",5,"  One of the best (and most accurate) gay reprisentations in movies nowdays. Must see for anyone questioning themselves. (Must see for everyone honestly)","Love Simon",7199,3.8,-1.2

"7207",3,"  It is an OK movie. The acting is good, the characters are well developed but the lack of conflict made the film a boring experience. I couldn't relate to any character and I found the plot unbelievable when in the 21th century is easy to come out the closet. It's another soft gay movie in a happy country called United States.","Love Simon",7207,3.8,0.8
"7208",5,"  This is wonderully beautiful film packed with comical sarcasm, teen angst, and love. I laughed and cried from the very first scene. However, it perpetuates an ideal lifestyle that is just not seen for LGBTQ+ youth. All in all, I loved the movie and would pay to see if another 10 times!","Love Simon",7208,3.8,-1.2
"7209",5,"  This is a movie with the type of characters I want to write. Every character in it is dynamic, intelligently written, and feels REAL. It's the type of movie you'll identify with, no matter how you identify. Simon is the person in us trying to be our true selves, Simon's family is the family we all want, and his friends are the friends we all want to be. If ""Love, Simon"" says anything, it says that this film features the type of people we all should strive to be. Just like real life, this movie isn't about who you love, but how you love.","Love Simon",7209,3.8,-1.2
"7210",5,"  So amazing. Great performances, funny dialogue and a heart wrenching plot. Different than the novel it was based on, but it has the same central points. Its easily as good as the book.","Love Simon",7210,3.8,-1.2

"7213",5,"  Incredible. I cried and laugh a lot.","Love Simon",7213,3.8,-1.2
"7214",5,"  Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it's a little more complicated: he's yet to tell his family or friends he's gay and he doesn't actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing.","Love Simon",7214,3.8,-1.2
"7215",5,"  EXCELLENT. Even my republican parents got teary eyed. Haha.","Love Simon",7215,3.8,-1.2
"7216",4.5,"  Was it the best movie i've ever watched? no. Was it something my 22 year old self needed at 13? Absolutly. It really was a wonderfil coming of age film, that I think a lot of LGBT kids can relate too. *Spoiler* but my favorite part had to be the google-ing ""how to dress gay"" like who hasn't done that? I loved it, laughed and even teared up a little. Honestly, I encourage everyone to go watch it and continue supporting it because we need Hollywood to know that these films can make profit & for more films like this to be released!!","Love Simon",7216,3.8,-0.7
"7217",5,"  Definitely recommend, made my gay heart so happy and definitely gave me the warm fuzzy feelings even with the sad moment","Love Simon",7217,3.8,-1.2

"7221",5,"  Great movie in so many ways! :)","Love Simon",7221,3.8,-1.2
"7222",5,"  As an 18 year old lesbian, this movie struck a major cord with me. Maybe I'm bias, but this movie blew me away. I don't see this kind of thing often, I hate romcoms and coming-of-age stories usually because they feel entirely unrelatable to me. This one didn't, it was different. I've never cried at a movie until I heard this one say things to me that I desperately needed to hear. It was beyond my expectations and I recommend it highly to any LGBT+ person with a couple hours to spare.","Love Simon",7222,3.8,-1.2
"7223",4.5,"  It was such a great movie. I loved and I want to see it again.","Love Simon",7223,3.8,-0.7
"7224",3.5,"  Empathetic and heartfelt, Love Simon overcome some missteps and offers an enjoyable coming-of-age film.","Love Simon",7224,3.8,0.3
"7225",4,"  While it falls right in with the ranks of past teen rom-com classics of the '80s and '90s, this is an updated version and a much needed one. Nick Robinson carries the role of leading man well, and while all of the supporting cast succeeds, Natasha Rothwell gives a standout comedic performance.","Love Simon",7225,3.8,-0.2
"7226",5,"  Funny and heartwarming.","Love Simon",7226,3.8,-1.2
"7227",0.5,"  What a joke of a movie.","Love Simon",7227,3.8,3.3
"7228",5,"  I've seen Love, Simon multiple times and each time is just as enjoyable, if not more so, than the 1st. This movie feels like therapy in a way. You laugh, cry, cheer along with everyone else in the theater, it's happened at every showing I've been to. This movie has made me deal with ghosts from my past, truths about my present, and the reality of my future. This movie means a lot to me, and for that i am thankful. I am not a young man, but I still have a lot of life left in me and I plan on living it to the fullest. I plan on living my life being more myself than I've been in a long time. Those of you that have seen the movie will recognize that quote. I thought turning 40 would be hard, a challenge. Yes, it's been a challenge, but it hasn't been hard. Being honest with myself, taking a real hard look at who I am, who I want to be, and what I want in this life, that has been the challenge and its been the greatest change in my life. Sorry if this post seems sappy, but i am not sorry for sharing it. I highly recommend going to see this movie, weither you're gay, straight, confused, married, single, or just OTHER. Love, Simon is just a great movie with a killer soundtrack, (I highly recommend getting the vinyl copy as well, its AMAZING). It might not change your life or provide you with greater insight, or that of someone you love or care for, but it'll definitely entertain you, and isn't that all we can ask for.","Love Simon",7228,3.8,-1.2

"7230",3.5,"  If you can get past the first 5-7 minutes which made me want to leave the theater since what I saw was so cliche, then you get a decent coming of age-type movie, with a diverse cast. If you want a REALLY GOOD coming of age film, see Ladybird. This was a good effort though, with a clever plot device. A bit too idyllic. My partner filmed a scene for about 8 hours for this film, and perhaps we were sort of disappointed with the movie since his scene was left on the editing room floor.","Love Simon",7230,3.8,0.3

"7233",4,"  Not the best teen movie I've ever seen, but very sweet and charming. I liked every character, (well, except the one we weren't supposed to like) and they all felt like real kids dealing with real issues. Yes, the ending is a bit pie in the sky, but the journey was compelling. Recommended!","Love Simon",7233,3.8,-0.2

"7238",4.5,"  This may very well be the greatest teen romance movie of this generation, not only because of how it has successfully become a milestone of inclusion, but also for its very relatable and well done story, along with likable and diverse characters.","Love Simon",7238,3.8,-0.7

"7240",1,"  I saw this film based on the strong critic and audience ratings. For me, it fell flat and I came close to walking out. There was no depth or heart in the story or the characters, even though they tried. And it was classically predictable. On the plus side, Nick Robinson was well cast and did a good job in the lead role. Jennifer Garner's role was a walk-through and her performance was a B-. Worse was Josh Duhamel, who seems like a nice guy in real life and was appealing in Las Vegas in 2003-2008 and has done nothing of substance since. The rest of the characters were incredibly white-bread, a collection of cute kids with nice smiles. Based on the reviews, I suspect most people will like it. In my opinion, the reviews and the film missed the mark.","Love Simon",7240,3.8,2.8
"7241",5,"  I finally know why hetero people love romcoms. The amount of awkwardness and emotional situations the characters went through was so relatable to anyone who has ever gone been there.

"7247",3.5,"  Love, Simon abandons most teen-targeted clichés in favor of a sweet and often quirkly coming-of-age story that's as engaging as it is funny, with a talented young cast, smart writing, and a film that could possibly be a game-changer in high school rom-com filmmaking!","Love Simon",7247,3.8,0.3

"7250",5,"  i was sobbing through the entire thing wow. it was amazing and the talks that simon had with his parents are the kind of talks i wish my parents gave me when i came out. as well, the set design was amazing? there were oreo packs strewn around simon's room and there's a nod to simon's email in the book with ""hour to hour note to note"" written on one of his bedrooms walls. the vice principals office is also adorable with posters telling students to bring him and apple and the poster behind his desk having pictures of student volunteers. as a whole it was gay, great, the movie of my dreams and oreos have been confirmed as gay culture thanks.","Love Simon",7250,3.8,-1.2
"7251",2,"  Definitely some dumb cheesy scenes, but besides that it was pretty spot on about being gay and the struggles of coming out. However, since when are cliché teen romance movies good? Or all we just pretending to like it because it's a gay love story? Yes, I appreciate movies like Love, Simon for opening up the film industry for more casual LGBTQ films; but that doesn't make this the ""BEST"" movie. Jennifer Garner was pretty great though, she was the only one casted well. That being said, it wasn't as bad as other bad teen romance movies; there wasn't an overwhelming amount of over exaggerated dramatic scenes, which is good.","Love Simon",7251,3.8,1.8
"7252",5,"  A fantastic movie. Just wish it had existed 20 years ago. Maybe then coming out wouldn't have been so hard.","Love Simon",7252,3.8,-1.2

"7256",5,"  This is a very well done movie. Not too heavy but showcases the angst of young gays who are stuck in a dilemma of coming out. Well written and very enjoyable.","Love Simon",7256,3.8,-1.2
"7257",5,"  Love Simon is the movie I needed. I never knew what it was like to have a supporting family when I came out and it hit so hard when I realized what I missed. Please watch this movie.","Love Simon",7257,3.8,-1.2

"7259",5,"  Great movie! Original, engaging, tear-jerking. This movie really found a way to help others to understand what this young man is going through. Everyone should see this movie, to expand their understanding of this ever relevant reality. Plus it is funny and heartfelt!","Love Simon",7259,3.8,-1.2
"7260",5,"  My ratings aren't very polished. Just a warning.This is a great movie for people who don't need to be overly lectured about gay people.I remember Moonlight took best picture. I was cheering for La la land. So I decided to give Moonlight a try. I probably wouldn't have watched it if it didn't win best picture.There's a big difference between ""Love, Simon"" and ""Moonlight"".Movies are basically ""empathy engines"". They evoke empathy from the audience, as well as educate and entertain.That's the big difference in my opinion between Love Simon and Moonlight.Love Simon is much more balanced. It's an empathy engine, it's educational, and most importantly it's entertaining and has some lighter humorous moments.Moonlight is also an empthy engine, and educational. But almost felt like a chore to me.Don't get me wrong. Both of these movies are monumental triumphs for the gay community. The world is a better place simply because both of these movies exist.However, if you're a person who already is educated about gay people, and you already have tolerance, compassion, and respect towards gay people, and you're straight......... then I would recommend Love Simon instead.Bottom line, Love Simon has humor and is entertaining.Moonlight felt like a chore. Like I was lectured for a couple of hours on how anyone can be gay. Even some tough guy. A condescending chore, that took 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.Moonlight to me is for people who need more education or empathy.Love Simon is for people who don't necessarily need more of those things, and want to be entertained as well.","Love Simon",7260,3.8,-1.2

"7262",5,"  I loved this movie so much. I laughed a lot and I loved the acting and the drama. Very well done and even though is not realistic, it makes you fantasize that one day being gay will be seen that natural.","Love Simon",7262,3.8,-1.2

"7265",5,"  Touching movie. It shows what gay teenagers would go through/experience when they come out. It shows people to not be afraid of who they are and that's a really important message in life. I really enjoyed this movie and give it 5 stars.","Love Simon",7265,3.8,-1.2

"7267",4,"  What at sweet movie. Granted a bit formulaic, with exception of the lead being gay - secret to hide, someone finds out, friends offended, blah, blah. But it was so refreshing to see a movie with a gay lead and romantic as well. Wish had this when i was a wee gay. It was just cute overall. I just assumed it was not a big deal anymore, but it likely will always be when coming out.","Love Simon",7267,3.8,-0.2
"7268",5,"  Cute, funny and heart warming.","Love Simon",7268,3.8,-1.2
"7269",4,"  This is a John Hughes film for a new generation. Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel are perfect as Simon's loving, supportive parents. Nick Robinson is wonderful as Simon. Simon is a good son, brother and friend with very little rebellious teenage angst. He is an engaging high school senior with a secret. Simon floats between the cliques but sticks with his closest friends. The conflict comes from Simon's not wanting his life to change, not from his letting people know he is gay. Those closest to him are more upset that he was keeping something from them than the actual secret. If the tweens sitting behind me are a sample, this film is an excellent illustration of our changing times. If you are a fan of teen movies, as I am, I recommend this film.","Love Simon",7269,3.8,-0.2
"7270",5,"  I felt as though this was a heartwarming story that helps to normalize the lives and emotions of gay people. I found my story connected to Simon's and found many of the things I have gone through in my life reflected in his trials but ultimately he shows that hes just like everyone else, except he is attracted to men. The plot itself used many tropes of romantic comedies and coming of age stories so it wasnt original, but it was normalizing and i find that refreshing.","Love Simon",7270,3.8,-1.2
"7271",4,"  A great rom-com. It approaches the genre like very few others. I think it effectively conveyed the difficulty that people have to go through when coming out to friends and family. By design there were many parts where I cringed super hard. There were tear jerking moments that almost got me, and jokes that hit hard, solid movie.","Love Simon",7271,3.8,-0.2
"7272",5,"  Most touching movie I've seen in a long time. Loved this movie.","Love Simon",7272,3.8,-1.2
"7273",4.5,"  To anyone else this movie may just be another teen coming-of-age film, but to those who have really been there--who can really relate--this movie is for them. ""Love, Simon"" is meant for all those teenagers on the LGBTQIA+2 spectrum so that they too can have their movie, cry with characters they can relate to, and maybe even heal some of their own scars.","Love Simon",7273,3.8,-0.7

"7279",5,"  Love, Simon is, in my opinion, a story that needs to be told over and over and over again. Young people tortured by the truth and/or fear that they are gay often do not have ears to turn to for reassure. The paraphrase a line in the movie, coming out or announcing anything else monumental, can be a terrifying experience. ""What if the world doesn't like you?"" If you haven't seen it, it is a must. If you are a young person struggling to come to terms with your sexuality, please know that there are many out there that love you for who you are.","Love Simon",7279,3.8,-1.2

"7284",4,"  I wound up really liking this movie. Coming of age/romcoms have gotten routine and by the numbers in recent years, but this movie stood out because of its charming cast & it's heartfelt story of being gay and coming out as a teenager.

The people who're in production and acting for this film are totally heartfelt. You can tell they put their hearts into making this real. I cried during nearly the entire movie. Every scene had something beautiful in it.A part that hit me hard was the scene with Simon's mom telling him that he deserves everything good. She still loved Simon even after he was out. It hit me hard because it's something personal. I wish my own mom would've had that reaction. Instead I got the butt-end of that ""accepting parent"" stick.I hope all of you out there, out or not, are happy. I hope you enjoy your lives to the fullest, YOUR fullest.","Love Simon",7299,3.8,-1.2

"7302",4,"  You didn't like Black Panther!? You're racist!You didn't like The Last Jedi!? You're a sexist pig! You don't think Wonder Woman should be nominated for an Oscar? You hate diversity!I'm starting to feel like I live in a world where my real opinions on the new age of progressive blockbusters are being held hostage by those that leverage people's fear of being called a racist, homophobe, or sexist against them. I mean heaven forbid if instead of getting offended and recklessly labeling someone, they actually consult their own ideas and explore them in a constructive conversation!So, let me clarify: I don't have a problem with the new age of blockbusters that are sending messages of equality, empowerment, and diversity, I have problem with the lackluster delivery of those messages. This is precisely why I love Greg Berlanti's Love, Simon. It isn't a film that demands to be called a classic just because of its progressive ideas on sexuality. It actually earns your respect and admiration with the care it puts into the parts that drive its message home. It's a movie that's hilarious as it is heartfelt, has a story that moves at an immaculate pace, and features fully realized characters that you'll remember long after you've left the theater.The Plot: Simon is a high school senior with a good head on his shoulders and everything going for him -- he has a happy family, loyal friends, and is all geared up and ready for college. But he has a secret that's been eating at him since middle school: he's gay. Having only one year left of high school, he wants to keep his ""normal life"" before coming out and truly being himself in college. But then his whole world changes when a boy anonymously comes out of the closet on his school's social network. Simon decides to connect with him under an alias, and as they bond over their situation, they eventually fall in love. Who is this boy? Will they reveal their identities to each other? Will they come out of the closet before graduation? These are the questions that keep the story moving.Now I haven't approached anything near the teen drama realm in years, so naturally, this movie's style caught me off guard. The color contrast is dialed up, the lighting is bright, and the way in which these characters exchange lines is very on the nose. But after about 5 minutes, I was able to settle in, as the aesthetic matches the feel-good tone of the film.The Acting: Nick Robinson (The 5th Wave) as the everyday teen that likes hanging out with his friends, getting coffee, and obsessing over music actually feels very real. There's a genuine charm to the actor that allows the low-key comedic delivery in his narration to be effective. He's also able to handle the lows that his character goes through without coming off as overdramatic. The rest of the actors that play his friends are all convincing in getting across that lifelong friendship dynamic with the actor, and I was very surprised with Josh Duhamel (a ""bro"" who always came off to me as a stock TV actor), who puts on a shockingly vulnerable performance as Simon's dad, but what really jumped off the screen at me were all the hilarious side characters. Tony Hale (Buster from Arrested Development) is great as the kids' awkwardly down to earth principal, but Natasha Rothwell as the defeated but scathingly sassy drama teacher stole the show for me. The film moves at a beautiful pace and manages to be both funny and heartfelt without being sappy. Most importantly, it's easy to take this ride with Simon through the highs and lows of his senior year because screenwriters, Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, have maintained the original novel's ability to make his struggle universally relatable, regardless of whether you're straight or gay. If you've ever felt like you're ""holding your breath"" because you feel different, alienated, or lost, you will feel a strong connection to this film.Overall, Love, Simon reminds me of a combination of the humor of Mean Girls meets the coming of age story of a John Hughes film. I understand there have been many films that have explored the many issues the LGBT community faces, but the fact that director, Greg Berlanti and co., are able take this tale of sexual self-discovery to the mainstream and make it relatable on such a wide scale is important. I firmly believe this film will go on to educate, empower, and possibly save lives.","Love Simon",7302,3.8,-0.2
"7303",5,"  Was a beautiful rollercoaster of emotions and twists. I could not contain my screams and emotions. Honestly I left the theatre with a pounding heart and drained muscles with the bliss of endorphins released after performing the horizontal two step (too much? Well it's true) beautiful beautiful movie.","Love Simon",7303,3.8,-1.2
"7304",3.5,"  My best friend got me into Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda, the book which Love, Simon is based on. It's definitely one of the best YA novels I've read, but given everything I know about Hollywood's business practices, it was never a sure deal that the movie would be anywhere near as good as the book. Thankfully, I can say Love, Simon is a great movie worthy of the source material.To be clear, though, Love, Simon is not the most faithful adaptation. It takes the same plot points but follows them very loosely. Some scenes are embellished for dramatic effect. Others are streamlined to keep the narrative focus. That's probably why the movie is named Love, Simon rather than Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda. Among the few ways this adaptation falters, though, is the new characters, namely the shameless vice principal included for comedic effect. Given the book's characters already entertain with their witty banter, his presence in the movie is redundant at best. Another subplot, involving Katherine Langford's (13 Reasons Why) Leah, is shoehorned and will rub fans of the book the wrong way. What's most important, however, is that the movie retains the book's voice, and it does without missing a beat. Despite being a PG-13 movie, nothing is sanitized, not even the book's profanity or sexually explicit talk. Simon and co.'s quick-witted, tech-savvy, and pop-culture infused voice is not only still there, it gets enhanced by the big screen.If I were to describe Love, Simon in one word, it would be smooth. Everything about this movie is so smooth. That quick-witted tone powers through the first two acts non-stop up until the narrative gets really serious. The sound-track seamlessly transitions to and from alternative pop, electronic, and original music. Nothing exemplifies this movie's smoothness more than Simon's car driving past to reveal an opening credit. While many other movies fumble their flashback or fantasy sequences, those scenes fit perfectly in Love, Simon. That the director behind Love, Simon is himself a gay man is to the movie's advantage. From this movie's queer camera angles, if you'll excuse the pun, to everything about Simon's experience, this movie rings true to the queer experience. Love, Simon is an excellent movie for both LGBT+ and straight moviegoers.","Love Simon",7304,3.8,0.3
"7305",4,"  It's good for the industry. So this is about a senior boy in high school (Nick Robinson). He is still in the closet, but when somebody anonymously reveals that they are also gay on the high school gossip website, he strikes up an e-mail friendship that starts to blossom into something more. While I am not gay, I most definitely appreciate diversity in film. Honestly, white straight males have had their run on Hollywood this entire time, and it is about time we see different points of view not only to be fair, but to also keep things fresh. While I wouldn't consider this to be groundbreaking, as this does fit right into the mold of a standard coming of age movie, I am positive this will do wonders for the different types of movies we get going forward if its a hit. Now I was excited for this, but I don't think I ever expected to dig this movie to the extent that I did. I kind of view this as a more successful version of The Edge of Seventeen, and they probably would make for a pretty good double feature together. The story really pulls you in with jokes that hit as you get to know Simon, and I didn't know that Nick Robinson had a performance like this in him. The only other movie I have seen him in is the special effect heavy Jurassic World, and while I love that, I have to admit that he is only asked to do so much next to the dinosaurs. Love, Simon not only does a really good job of making you believe the actors are the age that they are portraying, but it also makes you realize how different high school is nowadays with technology and social media. Information and gossip can travel like wildfire because you can post it for all to see instead of having to physically relay information on phone or in person, so when a bomb gets dropped online after school, you know you are going to walk into stares the following day, even from the school staff. Regardless if you are gay or not, there is very likely going to be a character in this that you are going to be able to see yourself in, at least to some degree. Everybody is going to react differently to this secret, and I think this is a story that successfully showcases what coming out is all about. I know that this movie is going to mean a lot to its intended audience, but even if you aren't in that group, it is still relatable, as this guy is just an awkward teenager longing for a connection, just like everybody else in this world. It is rare that I recommend a movie to everyone when I don't consider it to be perfect, but this is that case.","Love Simon",7305,3.8,-0.2
"7306",1,"  I was excited about this movie and I wanted to like it despite the cheesy trailer, but it fell short. Love, Simon very much felt like a movie created by straight people for a straight audience so they could feel all liberal and progressive about themselves. This didn't feel real to me. Everything was generic. Everything was so generic that nothing about this movie felt specific to the queer experience-even coming out was framed as merely an example of a universal experience. Most infuriatingly vapid was the film's central metaphor, that being gay is like a ferris wheel because life has its ups and downs. The film's creators were clearly trying hard to make their straight audience identify with Simon, which is all well and good, but this easy identification comes at the expense of any truth or complexity in the story. Straight people may watch this and feel that they understand the gay experience because they too have their ups and downs and they too sometimes find it difficult to open up to people, but the gayness in Love, Simon is incredibly superficial. Most gays are not white, upper-middle class, suburban boys with two progressive parents and a little sister. I am all of those things, just like Simon, and yet I still found myself utterly unable to identify with him. There was nothing to identify with. His character had no substance. The other characters were no better.I'm glad that Hollywood has finally decided that it can sufficiently profit off gay people and allies for gay films to be a profitable endeavor, but the film industry can do better.One final note-I've heard this referred to as a romcom, but this film was neither particularly romantic nor a comedy. The jokes are sparse and seemed to be designed for a straight audience, just like the rest of the movie.","Love Simon",7306,3.8,2.8
"7307",5,"  While marketed as a romcom, Love Simon manages to balance the typical expectations of the genre with a decent representation of life as a queer kid today. Various scenes had me turning to my friend, whisper-shouting how true the experiences are. Love simon is, all in all, a cute story with an extremely relatable protagonist(for LGBT audience members at least). Bonus points for a high quality LGBT film that doesn't end in death, disease, or depression. Taking my mom to go see it soon.","Love Simon",7307,3.8,-1.2
"7308",5,"  I finally have my own high school movie!! Thanks Greg Berlanti, Nick Robinson and Fox for a cinematic experience I'll never forget! This film will save lives, many lives, you can count on that!","Love Simon",7308,3.8,-1.2
"7309",5,"  inspirational, beautiful, incredible, amazing... just a couple words i can use to describe how groundbreaking this movie was. i loved the book, so seeing simon's story come to life was just wonderful. it was a story of teen love, coming of age, friendship, and family. it has offered much needed representation and acceptance to millions around the world. i'm still in awe.","Love Simon",7309,3.8,-1.2
"7310",5,"  I loved how the movie was related to hight schoolers and it was not just a teen girl movie boys and adults can see it too.","Love Simon",7310,3.8,-1.2
"7311",5,"  This is the movie the LGBT movie needs and deserves. I honestly thought it was better than the book and really filled in some gaps that the reading left out. It's tear jerking and tugs at your heart strings so much that you will be crying from start to finish.","Love Simon",7311,3.8,-1.2
"7312",5,"  Almost perfect. All I could think about while watching Simon was that if John Hughes had made a movie for me during my adolescent years, it would have been just like this. This is a movie that teens and adults will watch and find a piece they can all relate to. It is about compassion, angst and the idea that our experiences are not as different as we would like to think.","Love Simon",7312,3.8,-1.2
"7313",5,"  Extremely well made, and strikes the right balance between humor and depth. Great moments for laughter and tears, and the audience in my theater clapped at the ending! I thought it did an awesome job of conveying the internal turmoil and thought processes behind coming out, and portrayed each coming out conversation really honestly. Great casting and solid performances from everyone, especially Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner. Super thankful to Fox and Greg Berlanti for making this movie! It's an amazing feeling to finally get to identify with the main character of a movie, and get to see an experience similar to my own portrayed on screen! I've seen it twice already, but I could watch it 100 more times and I would gladly if I could convince someone new to give it a chance each time!","Love Simon",7313,3.8,-1.2
"7314",5,"  I don't have too much to say other than I love this movie! The amazing cast of Love Simon portrays an even more amazing story. Simon is a lot of us deep down and is the hero many young people need. Refreshing as all hell.","Love Simon",7314,3.8,-1.2
"7315",5,"  This was an amazing movie that was so moving and truly touched my heart. I would give it a 10000000000000/10 if I could :)","Love Simon",7315,3.8,-1.2
"7316",4,"  This was a fun, sweet movie that had many clever and relatable moments, and is an important milestone for inclusive teen romances, that also teaches some lessons along the way.","Love Simon",7316,3.8,-0.2
"7317",4.5,"  Super sweet, great story. ??","Love Simon",7317,3.8,-0.7
"7318",3.5,"  ""You get to exhale now, Simon."" Our protagonist, a closeted gay teenager, spends his story learning that he's as worthy to live as anyone else. This humanizing of the LGBT community is the soul of Love, Simon. So not only is the movie funny, romantic and emotional, it's vital. Underneath it's occasionally cliched tendencies, it's a heartfelt and lovingly made love story that allows a complex, confusing and invigorating part of life be just that: complex, confusing and invigorating. Love, Simon would be forgiven if, like so many other coming-out films, it was an ultra-depressing melodrama. However, it takes a different approach. Sure, there are brief moments of blatant bigotry, a couple of beautiful parent-reaction scenes, and some hilarious over-compensation by ""woke"" supporters. However, this story takes place in the modern world, in which homosexuality isn't nearly as taboo as it was even just a couple years ago. So instead of the big, obvious fears that kids who come out face (social rejection, familial disappointment, etc), it gets into the real dirt. Will my friends see to me differently? Will my identity be solely wrapped up in who I'm attracted to? Can I control other's perceptions of me?That tendency for honest authenticity are the film's strengths. It makes it all the more frustrating that the crux of the plot revolves around a side-character who is neither honest nor authentic, but purely a device for pushing a predictable and unnecessary plot along. It's such distractingly poor writing, a lesser film would've broken under its contrived weight. But Love, Simon's strengths of big-heart and familiar humor completely win out, giving us the best Hollywood-high-school flick since Clueless.","Love Simon",7318,3.8,0.3
"7319",5,"  GROWING UP IN THE 80'S I was fortunate enough to see the films of a fantastic writer director of teen movies, his name was john hughes. This movie felt to me like a modern john hughes teen movie. The one twist that john never had a chance to do is make a gay teen the main character. the movement from scene to scene and the character's have depth yet not enough not to OVERRIDE simon leaving the watcher to feel simons angst that much more. As far as the writing it was excellent and can appeal to older generations who struggled the same as simon, maybe the method of coming out has changed but the emotion has not, love,simon spreads that STRUGGLE through the generations. Though the ending could have been more romantic it was awkward like first love always is. if you're a parent wanting to understand what your child is or has gone through this is a great movie to process what it is like for them.","Love Simon",7319,3.8,-1.2
"7320",5,"  Such a sweet show. It was so unlike the shows I had as a young teenager to see gay life. Just a good feel show, that you wished every person coming out could have as there truth. Very positive for all.","Love Simon",7320,3.8,-1.2
"7321",5,"  This movie brought so many emotions to the surface. it was such a solid movie. it had a great mix of feelings that really showed what life is like for closeted gay teens. i went and saw it multiple times. i just can't get enough of it.","Love Simon",7321,3.8,-1.2
"7322",3.5,"  WHO LOVES YOU, BABY? - My Review of LOVE, SIMON (3 1/2 Stars)The poster reads: Everyone Deserves A Great Love Story. I would add that each generation deserves a great teen movie. Think back to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, BYE BYE BIRDIE, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, SIXTEEN CANDLES, HEATHERS, ELECTION, MEAN GIRLS, and PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER for a small sampling over the decades. During those formative years, I think everybody looks back so fondly on this specific genre. Now, director Greg Berlanti and writers Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker have adapted Becky Albertalli's novel ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" to create something groundbreaking, the first major studio film to have a gay teen lead character. Love it or hate it, like BLACK PANTHER, this film has the potential to inspire generations of kids who have never seen themselves at the center of a story. Back in 2005, the success of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN seemed to indicate that the studios would produce more films with leading gay characters. It didn't happen, so here we are at another crossroads, where the very successful TV producer, with a roster of Superhero shows to his credit, and who started his career with the gay film, THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB, become the great gay hope of saving gay cinema. It's hardly fair to expect such an outcome, considering the multitude of filmmakers who have produced much more layered, experimental fare than LOVE, SIMON...but Simon has made it into the multiplexes and national ads...so he feels the pressure. So is it any good, and how does it stack up against the great teen movies? Not great, but not bad either. It's a calculated film, devoid of anything too controversial, filled with a surprisingly diverse cast, and hedging its bets at times. You're not gonna hear any character say anything as remotely inspired as ""Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Teresa?"" in this film. LOVE, SIMON operates firmly in the ""Young Adult"" genre that has seen great success with the megahit THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. That movie seems to provide the template - a slightly comedic, but mostly serious tone. What I hated more than anything was the opening moment. Simon (Nick Robinson of JURASSIC WORLD), who lives with his perfect family (Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, and his kid sister/aspiring chef, played by the wonderful Talitha Bateman), bounds out of their McMansion and into a fancy SUV as he says in voiceover, ""I'm just like you"". I immediately recoiled, wondering how anyone living in a dumpy hovel would relate to this. Now I know I'm not the target audience for this film, and the story lives firmly inside upper middle class suburbia, but it felt tone deaf right off the bat.Things eventually kick in as we explore Simon's world, filled with good friends, old and new. From the trailers, however, you know that Simon has a secret - he's gay and not ready to share that with the world. Instead, he develops an e-mail relationship with another closeted gay kid, both of them anonymously baring their souls to each other. Simon spends the rest of the story trying to figure out the identity of this ""pen pal"", with whom he's fallen in love. As such, the movie has a whodunit structure, filled with sly misdirects and an 11th hour surprise. It's a surprisingly rich film, filled with characters, despite the overall edge-free tone, who all get their moments of substance. Although nowhere near as affecting as Michael Stuhlbarg's big moment in CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, Garner and Duhamel each have wonderful scenes when their son comes out to them. Duhamel, in particular, made me cry. Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. all have a sweet, snappy rapport with our hero, and storylines to suggest their lives don't just revolve around him (a refreshing thing for this genre), but it's all pitched at a rich kid blandness level at times. The people Simon suspects of being ""Blue"", the name of his pen pal, get able portrayals as well from the likes of Joey Pollari (great in AMERICAN CRIME), Miles Heizer, and Keiynan Lonsdale. It doesn't help that Simon himself is a bit of a bore. Robinson has a strong presence, but I just wanted him to be funny more often. Think of Molly Ringwald's deliciously mouth-breathing Samantha Baker in SIXTEEN CANDLES as she reacts to her panties on display in that famous scene. She's delightfully captivating. Winona Ryder furiously writing notes while sporting a monocle in HEATHERS held you firmly in her grips. Simon, on the other hand, while not ashamed to be gay, feels sullen and receding. While the mystery storyline will likely keep you guessing throughout, the big reveal felt a little false. I do love that two teens learn to love what's inside of someone before seeing the exterior, but in reality, I couldn't help but think that Simon counted his lucky stars that he found his crush attractive. Part of me was hoping the big reveal would turn out to be a female character who is a lesbian. But this is a teen romance and not an LGBT Summit Meeting!Trouble comes in the form of Martin (Logan Miller), the closest the film has to a villain, as a guy who threatens to out Simon if he doesn't fix him up with his friend Abby. Luckily, even Martin gets an empathetic portrayal, with Miller reminding me of a slightly wilder version of Breckin Meyer's character in CLUELESS. I mean, seriously, there's another example of a film with a main character who shines. Come on, Simon, lighten up!I could have done with less Tony Hale (VEEP) as the Vice Principal with a streak for showboating comic relief, but I enjoyed a few of his moments. Same goes for INSECURE's Natasha Rothwell, who adeptly steals every one of her scenes as a beyond-over-it drama coach. If only the central character had been Ethan (Clark Moore), an out gay kid with the hard shell and ""reading"" abilities of the best queens from RuPaul's Drag Race. Now THAT would have been a central gay character who pops, but, alas, the studios just aren't ""there yet"". Baby steps I suppose. LOVE, SIMON, despite the many people of color in the film, is a white movie for the masses. I can't fault it for that, but it's not the most original gay film ever made. For those experiences, go to your local LGBT Film Festival or flip through your streaming options. If this movie causes its audience to do that, then thank you Greg Berlanti and co. for helping to pave the way.","Love Simon",7322,3.8,0.3
"7323",5,"  The most important movie this year. It's time that the gays got a rom-com to be proud of!","Love Simon",7323,3.8,-1.2
"7324",5,"  It is bubblegum in a beautiful Rom-Com package - everything we need for us in the LGBTQ+ community to feel just like everyone else! I cried through a solid 60% of the movie. Well done!!","Love Simon",7324,3.8,-1.2
"7325",3.5,"  I enjoyed Love, Simon immensely! It is a highly polished picture of Simon struggling with his sexuality. If it wasn't such an idealized picture of a well adjusted family, I might have found it more weighty. There just wasn't a spot of grit in it, which might have made it seem more realistic. A great guilty pleasure.","Love Simon",7325,3.8,0.3
"7326",5,"  One of the best coming-of-age films I have seen in a very long time. Setting aside how important this film is to the LGBTQ+ community, although it is undoubtedly a huge factor, this narrative film takes you along the beautiful, exciting, and at times heartbreaking and painful journey of Simon Spier. It's very real, and as viewers you are taken on that journey regardless of whether you relate to the characters sexual orientation. *Spoilers Ahead* When Simon undergoes life's awkward moments, which there are plenty of especially in your teen years, you feel it. When Simon is terriefied of being outed before he is ready, you feel his fear, you understand his anxiety and his nervousness. When he finally confronts his parents, you feel the tension and relief. You tear up and you are filled with emotions. When he finally finds out who the mysterious Blue is, you clap really loudly because everything falls into place and your faith in romance and happy endings is restored once again. A MUST SEE!","Love Simon",7326,3.8,-1.2
"7327",5,"  The most heart-warming movie I've watched in a while, the mood of the movie changed quite often which allowed suspense to overcome me, which added another layer of life to this wonderful film!","Love Simon",7327,3.8,-1.2
"7328",5,"  Super sweet. Thoughtful. Charming. And important. There's a little bit of all of us in this beautiful 80s throwback.","Love Simon",7328,3.8,-1.2
"7329",5,"  Love, Simon will make you happier. There's no way around it. Humor, heart, great performances, and a killer soundtrack will take you away to a place where for a little under two hours, you know life will be a little bit better.","Love Simon",7329,3.8,-1.2
"7330",5,"  I loved this movie so much!!! It's sooooooo goood. It's like the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life. I love it, if I could I would go see it 10 more times.","Love Simon",7330,3.8,-1.2
"7331",5,"  Have seen TWO special screenings of the movie and I absolutely loved it. It's just a great movie, and the subject matter happens to be gay. It appeals to a wide variety of ages, genders, and sexual orientations! And the cast of the movie is diverse as well! It's the gay movie I've been waiting for my whole life and I have so much love and appreciation for having seen it. Whether you're gay, straight, or in between, you will absolutely love this movie! <3","Love Simon",7331,3.8,-1.2
"7332",5,"  This movie really surprised me. I had pre-conceived ideas that it would be your typical teen love story but this movie was much more than that. This movie had a lot of heart and even as a straight man i felt some of the emotion that the lead character was presenting. This movie really made you feel and i loved the family in this movie they were so great. It was much more than a teen romance film, it was about family, friendship, and so much more. Again I was really surprised by this one and loved it!","Love Simon",7332,3.8,-1.2
"7333",5,"  Amazing! Loved every minute of it.","Love Simon",7333,3.8,-1.2
"7334",5,"  Watching the different types of people walking into the theatre to watch Love, Simon gives me so much joy but also makes me a bit anxious. Seeing older couples shock me so much bc I'm not entirely sure if they know what they'll be watching. Seeing families with their young kids makes me nervous if the parents would be offended to have their children see gay content. Seeing straight masc bros with their girlfriends and buddies make me wary of homophobic jokes being made. I've seen this movie twice now and in actuality none of that happens. Everyone enjoys it to some degree. In a way, having this type of movie mainstream for everyone to see is like when I used to turn the volume up on the TV at home when gay related news or storylines came on so my mom would hear hoping this would make her more ok with the idea of homosexuality in general. This is that but at a much grander scale. And it's amazing.  I know a lot of people have issues with this movie for it being centered on a white middle class straight passing boy. Obviously it's not perfect. But I think this movie opens the doors for those creators who want to make a diversely represented story in the film industry in the future. I think what I love about this the most is the shared experience the moviegoers have. You can see gays of different ages from older generations who never thought something like this would exist in their lifetime to younger gays with their significant other or their squad who have been craving representation like this. We have been hungry for something like this. And this is such a monumental step for mainstream representation.","Love Simon",7334,3.8,-1.2
"7335",3.5,"  Greg Berlanti's ""Love, Simon"" may not be a perfect movie. Yes, there is an entire subplot involving blackmail that kind of takes away from the whole premise of the film. Yes, the central mystery kind of fizzles into a just ""okay"" reveal at the film's conclusion. And, yes, the film's world and high school characters don't feel as real as those on display in movies like ""Superbad,"" ""Me And Earl And The Dying Girl,"" and ""Lady Bird."" But the central elements are all on point. The protagonist, as written and performed, is absolutely stellar and likable. All the scenes involving his internal dilemma are incredibly powerful and moving. And the thematic messages in play here are undeniably relevant. I just feel as though some of the more ancillary elements could have been punched up to make those more central threads even more powerful. But still - an overall enjoyable film.","Love Simon",7335,3.8,0.3
"7336",5,"  This movie was so awesome so touching inspiring I wish there was a movie like this when I was in High school I want to watch it again and again defiantly go watch it.","Love Simon",7336,3.8,-1.2
"7337",5,"  MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!","Love Simon",7337,3.8,-1.2
"7338",5,"  This Movie is so beautiful and inspirational and will always be dear to my heart LOVE this movie so much","Love Simon",7338,3.8,-1.2
"7339",4,"  For me, the biggest strength of this movie was not Simon's coming out, nor finding out who Simon's secret lover was, but instead it was getting to know Simon's family. It was incredible to see a movie that demonstrated everything great about what a family unit can be. Simon's family, and their display of support in the film, was marvelous and that aspect of it caught me off guard . But to add to that as well, talk about a movie full of surprises, honest reflection, light humor, and great writing. I got so much more out of this movie than I ever expected. Maybe a bit oversimplified at times, but it was quite a good movie.","Love Simon",7339,3.8,-0.2
"7340",5,"  best movie of all time","Love Simon",7340,3.8,-1.2
"7341",5,"  Seeing such a genuine take on a coming out story was incredibly refreshing. You can tell that this movie was written for queer people and those that are looking to support and help nurture their experience. At the end of the day, it could be a shit movie and what it says about coming out, and how it demands love, support, and understanding from people is absolutely remarkable. It also happens that it's not a shit movie. It's funny, and well written, and emotionally enthralling. I feel it has been absolutely wonderful to see a movie like this released, and I hope it would provide the emotional support to young queer people and the families supporting them that many people long past the pinnacle of coming out wish they had had in their corner.","Love Simon",7341,3.8,-1.2
"7342",4.5,"  I thought that this was a great adaptation of Becky Albertalli's book, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, and an all around great movie. The only real complaint that I have about the movie is the fact that they left out the part of Martin's backstory from the book involving his brother. While I definitely didn't think it justified Martin's actions towards Simon, it at least explained his actions. Without that part of Martin's backstory being mentioned in the movie, it ultimately made Martin a much less sympathetic and likable character. Other than that, I absolutely loved Love, Simon. :)","Love Simon",7342,3.8,-0.7
"7343",5,"  This movie is very important for us to progress as a society and learn to accept each other for who we are. At the end of the day, who we choose to love is no one's business but your own. The book was amazing as well, and the ending is amazing. Overall just revolutionary! This movie is very important to me personally, and it is important for other members of the LGBTQ+ community in order to recognize that being yourself is okay.","Love Simon",7343,3.8,-1.2
"7344",4.5,"  Such a wonderful story of Simon and his struggle deciding when to come out as gay to his friends and family. Great story, well acted, wonderful film.","Love Simon",7344,3.8,-0.7

"7346",4.5,"  The best part of Love, Simon is that is comes across as such a normal love story. It is so relatable. Something like this movie has been missing from genre for a long time. The representation in the film is also important, and stays true to the book in that aspect, which I am very happy about. Although I believe the book was better, the movie is a great take on it and truly heartwarming.","Love Simon",7346,3.8,-0.7
"7347",1,"  Nick Robinson's emotionally carried performance does not work here, as it is a bad performance, carried by his co-stars who couldn't even get out a line without a voice-crack.","Love Simon",7347,3.8,2.8

"7351",1,"  IT had a predicted story line. I was not impressed. The characters showed promise but the story line was not strong.","Love Simon",7351,3.8,2.8
"7352",5,"  Watched the movie last Saturday and it was amazing. It wasn't like a depressing teen angsty bullshit. It was predominantly a rom-com. It contains hilarious digs at social norms and, despite that, remains to be very relatable. The titular protagonist, Simon, is precious with heart-warming characteristics. His quest to find Blue is as frustrating as it is exciting. He takes us through falling in love with each person that could potentially be Blue, and make us fall out of love upon finding that they aren't. Each person that he thought was Blue was, at first, portrayed to be amazing and infallible as they are in the eyes of those falling in love for the first time. But gradually normalizes each of them upon realization that they aren't Blue. Anyways, for the most part, it was amazing and heart-warming. I strongly recommend it as an alternative to all of the heart-pounding movie releases in the next 6 months.","Love Simon",7352,3.8,-1.2
"7353",5,"  The BEST MOVIE EVER CREATED. I cried 3 times, and as soon as it comes on ITunes, I am buying it. And then will continue to watch it at least once a week <3","Love Simon",7353,3.8,-1.2

"7359",5,"  I love Love, Simon. Nick Robinson is vulnerable and authentic as 17 year-old Simon, who ""comes out"". Director Greg Berlanti makes this more than the landmark teen gay love story. Love, Simon is about daring to fall in love and being free to be. That is a world we all deserve.Simon eloquently says, ""I'm still me..."" Truth. Love, Simon has such beauty and poignancy. Perhaps, someday what makes Love, Simon so revolutionary will no longer be so.","Love Simon",7359,3.8,-1.2

"7371",5,"  This could very well be the best movie ever made about homosexuality.SPOILER ALERTThe concept of being able to breathe now sums up what it's like coming out. The film's producers really made this film authentic.","Love Simon",7371,3.8,-1.2
"7372",4.5,"  From Disney Channel and ABC sitcoms to the critically acclaimed works of Juno, Boyhood, and Lady Bird, it's no secret that ""coming-of-age"" stories are everywhere. Yet there's a reason why so few TV shows and films actually get high school right. Such a task requires a skillful balance of relatable characters and a plot that is as believable as it is entertaining. Young adult years are a time of self-discovery, uncomfortable change, and figuring out how the world works, as well as our roles in the process. What I loved most about this film was that it tackled social isolation, inter-generational mentorship, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and acceptance of differences without seeming woefully melodramatic. Some call it a milestone for diversity and inclusion in this genre of film, and on some level, I have to agree. I felt every emotion portrayed onscreen - good, bad, and everything in between - to a depth that I had not anticipated, and I left the theatre both pleasantly surprised and anxious to experience it all over again. It was ultimately a story that, due to its refreshing honesty, worked its various elements cohesively from start to finish. I think we have a young adult classic in the making.","Love Simon",7372,3.8,-0.7

"7375",5,"  An astoundingly accurate depiction of teenage coming out, like, seriously. This is such an important milestone for queer kids everywhere. Someone like them is at the forefront of a movie and not just a one-off side character. There's human development, change, and realness, along with relaxing comedy when you need it. Coming out is hard, and it's something many teens struggle in doing each day. It was high time we finally had a movie that they can see themselves in. That I can see myself in. Love, Simon will forever be a part of my movie collection, and remain a testament to what film can be for people like me.","Love Simon",7375,3.8,-1.2
"7376",5,"  Love, Simon Dir: Greg Berlanti Synopsis: 17 year old Simon has conflicts with himself about coming out to his friends and family about being gay. He discovers someone else at his school is also conflicted. They become email pen pals without knowing one another and eventually fall in love. Now first and foremost I must say that when I watch films, I watch them for what they are. I'm not biased toward any particular genre obviously with the exception of superhero films ?? So with that being said this was a superb and exceptional romance if I had to classify its genre. It was wonderfully filmed and the storyline was long enough to keep you curious as to who Simon's mystery pen pal is. If you have seen ""13 Reasons Why"" you will recognize a few familiar faces. For young actors and actresses they did a fantastic job at keeping the story engaged along with the veteran actors Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner. To be perfectly honest there really isn't anything I can pick out of this film to complain about. No dry points and the film progresses quick enough that you don't lose where the story is going. You get the primary story of Simon and his pen pal, trying to figure who the mystery person is and you get a side story that meshes into the primary so that it still plays a pivotal role in completing the film. The ending was unexpected which was nice considering you believe that the mystery person is solved 3/4 of the way through. Loved the film would def recommend a watch if you are into romance genre. 5/5 ???????? for the genre","Love Simon",7376,3.8,-1.2
"7377",4.5,"  A special movie for the sole purpose of existing in the first place. Director Berlanti and his team do a wonderful job of taking the familiar coming-of-age teen genre and providing a fresh perspective. What results is a movie full of humor, warmth, honesty and touching gravity. The cast is terrific and helps bring this story to vibrant life. The spirit of John Hughes is alive in this movie and updates it to 2018 to allow inclusion to be respsented. Highly recommneded.","Love Simon",7377,3.8,-0.7

"7388",4.5,"  Super cute movie. Loved that being gay was accepted by his family and friends, so different than my experience. Does my heart good to see this movie do so well and show that love is love!!!","Love Simon",7388,3.8,-0.7
"7389",5,"  It was such a wonderful movie. It showed the struggles of teenage hood, but also how hard it can be to be different then others and how important it is to how wonderful friends and bonds. I hope this movie continues to inspire gay people to tell their friends and family and realize that it is okay to be gay.","Love Simon",7389,3.8,-1.2
"7390",3,"  Cute movie only, with an emphasis on CUTE. A little too sugary sweet and manipulative for my tastes. The character Martin is so horrible that I can not even fathom the other kids giving him even a chance at being a member of their group. And Simon shows an all too easily lost set of ethics towards his friends. I'm a gay adult now, and grew up in the sticks of southern Indiana, so I know what it's like to try and hide one's sexual orientation, but I just don't buy that a true friend would so easily con his friends. So, to me, that aspect of the movie did not ring true. Also, although the scene with Josh Duhamel (the dad) was, once again, CUTE/SWEET, I thought that Duhamel's attempt at ""crying"" was just awful. He's a very pretty man but not an overly great actor. This movie seems to be billed as a teen rom-com and that's what I'd say it comes off as successfully. Just kind of a teen fluff piece more apropos as an after-school movie.","Love Simon",7390,3.8,0.8
"7391",5,"  FREAKING AMAZING. AS A GAY TEEN, THIS REALLY HIT HOME AND I CRIED SO HARD. THIS MOVIE MEANS SO MUCH TO ME OH MY. AMAZING. I LOVED IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

"7393",5,"  As a fan of the book (Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda), I was both thrilled and nervous to see the movie. I got my tickets for the Thursday night premiere, and the first thing I noticed was the composition of the audience in the theatre. Excluding me, every single group of people in attendance had a preteen or teenager (many of them in rainbow shirts or wearing rainbow bracelets) and what appeared to be their parents or grandparents. I could have cried. Have you ever been in a movie with LGBTQ teens or their allies and their parents? What a world we live in.The movie was sweet, touching, hilarious, moving -- I could give you a thousand similar words. What struck me most, however, were the changes made from the original source material. I realized halfway through the movie that the book was the gay rom-com that LGBTQ teens wanted... but the movie was the story that we all needed. There's one scene that was added from the book between Simon and his mother that will give closure to every one of us who had a rough coming out experience. My last comment about this movie: I'm a very stoic movie-goer who doesn't tend to laugh out loud or cry. My eyes were burning with tears at parts. I burst out laughing multiple times. I actually screamed in a cheer at one point at the end. People in the theatre applauded. Please see this movie. Not only is it very well-made, but I have faith that this is going to be the key to truly bringing LGBTQ romance to mainstream movies.","Love Simon",7393,3.8,-1.2
"7394",3,"  Attractive young actors who are mostly boring and more mature and have more common sense than the adults in the film. The adults have all the funny lines. In essence it seems like cute made for TV movie that is interesting but just barely. You can definitely wait for this to come to DVD, doesn't have the script or plot or actor's chops of 'Call me BY your name'. But still a decent film.","Love Simon",7394,3.8,0.8

"7397",5,"  Love, Simon was an amazing drama that told it's story in a way that anyone could understand. As Simon struggles with being himself, he leaves the audience on their guard. Even if one can not relate, Love, Simon still teaches great lessons of love, honesty, friendship, acceptance, and to always be yourself.Overall, Love, Simon tells the brighter side of coming out.Although there is some bad language in the film, it is not too much and I would recogmend this film for children as well as adults.","Love Simon",7397,3.8,-1.2

Love, Simon is simply a landmark movie, and I pray more of the same good content is on its way.","Love Simon",7400,3.8,-1.2

"7406",5,"  Potentially life-saving-gay teens still try to kill themselves at rates 6-8x that of straight teens-but carries this message with grace and poignancy, as well as delightful moments of hilarity. Almost a perfect teen movie, fun and engaging but with an important message. As it happens, my 15-year old son came out to me three days ago and today we saw ""Love, Simon"". He loved it and found it affirming, and I have never been so thankful for a movie. I'm sure I'll see it again and would recommend it for parents and teens in our situation, but also for those who just want to understand and develop more empathy and compassion for LGBT teens.","Love Simon",7406,3.8,-1.2
"7407",0.5,"  This is a awefully normal high school show with unbearable cinematography and editing. I could say it is a cheap good looking film, but it definitely doesn't deserve 91 on rotten tamatoes. It gives me the feeling of just ""using"" the tag of gay to make a high school film. This movie is really without any asethetics apart from politically right.","Love Simon",7407,3.8,3.3
"7408",5,"  Beautiful, inspiring film that is funny, touching, sad, and deeply moving. Such an important and necessary film during this time that offers all kinds of representation. Try to excuse this as a meaningless romcom all you want?- there is so much more depth and meaning to this, and is quite literally inspiring thousands to come out. It?s been long overdue that the LGBTQ+ community had a cute, uplifting romcom!!! Absolutely loved it & really encourage you to support this project.","Love Simon",7408,3.8,-1.2

"7410",4,"  A great story about a young man coming out and the pressures of being a gay teenager in today's society. Simon (Nick Robinson) is an average teen that has a pretty great life. His mother (Jennifer Garner) and father (Josh Duhamel) are very supportive and loving. He has a sister that he actually likes and loves. His closest friends are also very great people too we have his two childhood friends Leah (Katherine Langford) and Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) have known him since he was 5 years old. Their newest addition to the crew is Abby (Alexandra Shipp) who is pretty damn cool. Pretty perfect life right? Well...Simon as you may have known from the trailer is gay, but hasn't told anyone. The film follows Simon through his senior year of high school where he begins to email a mysterious person from school calling themselves ""Blue"" who announces on a school board that he himself is a closeted gay teenager as well. Simon immediately has a connection with Blue and spends the year trying to find out who Blue is while also dealing with his own eventual coming out to the ones he loves the most. First and foremost Nick Robinson did a fantastic job here. I really cared for his characters and I enjoyed the chemistry between his friends and him throughout the film. It's very believable...to a point and I'll get to that in a moment. The movie has some great moments that are reminiscent of a teen coming of age tale, but with the obvious twist. When Simon eventually comes out to his family I found it was some incredible and touching scenes. The gripe I have is that the movie is still very predictable. From the first ten minutes I was able to figure out how the film would end. Blue's identity for me was a complete mystery though and I enjoyed that eventual payoff. The movie gets a bit too convenient for the last 20 minutes that I didn't enjoy as much and even had some seemingly forced dialogue (looking at you Abby and Nick awkward dialogue). Overall, still a great film that I hope people give a chance regardless of your sexual orientation. It's a great coming of age movie and a great look into the life of someones life that's different than the supposed ""norm.""","Love Simon",7410,3.8,-0.2

"7414",4.5,"  I saw someone else describe this movie as ""woke John Hughes,"" and that's pretty much perfect. Love the cast, it's a solid adaptation of a truly wonderful book, and it balances seriousness and humor so well. Already it means a lot to so many people. Definitely one to see.","Love Simon",7414,3.8,-0.7
"7415",5,"  Love, Simon was just what I had hoped for in a mainstream gay movie. I wish it had come out when I was younger and still dealing with being closeted because this movie is so special. Everyone should see this very sweet and heartfelt film. Definitely shed a few tears at the more painful moments as I remembered my own emotions of coming out and not knowing who I was. Absolutely recommend for everyone, a great movie that I'll cherish having watched.","Love Simon",7415,3.8,-1.2

Love, simon is that one movie that has many quotes to live by but also has many quotes that would never come out of a regular every day person's mouth. while we live in a day and age of, oh so you're gay, cool, this movie fits in with teen boys and girls that feel out of place and afraid to let their true self be shown. we all have that moment of not fitting in. even myself who is no longer in their teens. having moments that could easily be slapped into a hallmark original movie, love, simon has the ability to attract crowds of all types and is the movie that is much needed in a time when social media is used mainly for attention and who will get the most likes. love yourself and have strength in who you are. that is the ultimate message in this one. overall, love, simon is worth a watch.","Love Simon",7417,3.8,-0.2

"7419",4.5,"  ""Love, Simon"" (PG-13, 1:50) is a romantic comedy-drama directed by Greg Berlanti and written by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, based on the award-winning 2015 YA novel ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" by first-time author Becky Albertalli. The story centers on a closeted gay teenage boy who has to juggle a variety of interpersonal drama related to his obsession with keeping his secret.Simon (Nick Robinson), as his voiceover at the beginning of the film tells us, has a ""perfectly normal life""... except for that one big secret. He has loving parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) and a little sister (Talitha Bateman) whom he actually likes. Simon's closest friends (who ride with him to school every morning) are childhood friends Leah (Katherine Langford) and Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and, the newest member of the group, transfer student Abby (Alexandra Shipp). None of these people know Simon is gay and he wants to keep it that way... until he decides that he's ready to tell them. But external influences intrude. Simon sees a social media post by someone in his school who claims to be a closeted gay teenage boy at Simon's school, but doesn't identify himself by name, just referring to himself as ""Blue"". Blue's message includes a Gmail address, so Simon sets up a new account and begins corresponding with Blue, using the name ""Jacques"". As they encourage each other and cautiously begin sharing a few details about their personal lives, a socially awkward classmate named Martin (Logan Miller) learns about the Emails, makes copies of them and threatens to ""out"" Simon, unless Simon does something for him. Martin forces Simon to help him get together with Abby, which leads Simon to manipulate his closest friends, while hoping that Martin doesn't expose his secret and trying to figure out who Blue is. Simon has a lot of balls in the air and anyone can see they can't stay up there forever.""Love, Simon"" is an excellent romance which you don't have to be gay to enjoy. The main character isn't as tortured as those in ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Moonlight"", but not as carefree as those in ""Call Me By Your Name"". Simon is portrayed as happy and relatively well-adjusted, but is unsure about when or how to take the next step in being who he is. He's a good person who, unfortunately, gets off track and tries to solve his one big problem by acting selfishly. This movie's main point seems to be, as many people learn in their personal or professional (or political) lives, hiding the truth is usually more harmful than telling the truth. It's a lesson which rings true, as shown in the experiences of characters which feel genuine, in a movie that is entertaining and heartfelt. After all, regardless of sexual identity, as the film suggests, everyone deserves a great love story. And every cinematic love story deserves a script, a cast and a director as good as that of ""Love, Simon"". ""A""","Love Simon",7419,3.8,-0.7

"7428",5,"  As someone who is gay, it's awesome to see people like me be in the forefront of a big budget hollywood movie. This was the first time I truly related to a movie geared to people my age, especially with him struggling to come out to friends and family. It honestly felt so refreshing to watch a cheesy teen romcom that's not about your typical straight couple. I didn't even realize how much I needed something like this until I started to watch it, and it just hit me that there's almost nothing out there in mainstream media that centers around a same-sex couple. This movie is monumental to me and many other people, and I cannot even express how much it meant to have a gay teenager at the center of it. This is the first time I've felt represented in the media, and will hopefully pave the way for more stories of lgbt people in mainstream tv and movies.","Love Simon",7428,3.8,-1.2
"7429",4.5,"  Love, Simon is not the greatest movie ever made, but it doesn't try to be, nor does it need to be. It's more personal, more intimate, and delivers a good story with the help of some great actors and a handful of powerful scenes. Where many LGBT-centric movies feature tired jokes, shallow characters, and dumb stereotypes, Love, Simon brings a refreshing and heartfelt depth to it that will reach out to people everywhere. I think many people of all ages could stand to see this movie, and maybe learn something from it. Love, Simon may not be incredibly innovative or jaw-dropping, but it does a great job of showing what many LGBT kids see, think, and experience while living in the closet. Highly recommended from a bona fide gay person.","Love Simon",7429,3.8,-0.7
"7430",5,"  This is a movie that I truly believe everyone should see. It changed the way that I viewed the world, and is such an important modern coming of age story. The theater was packed, and my friends and I laughed and cried. Everyone in the theater jumped out of their seats and started clapping and cheering throughout the movie. I feel so lucky to be living in a time when movies are being put out like this, and I know that this will change so many lives. This is a must see for everyone, and is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen.","Love Simon",7430,3.8,-1.2

"7432",5,"  one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. I laughed and cried throughout the whole film. I would see this 100 times if I possibly could. The acting is phenomenal, the story is beautiful, and just the whols thing altogether is really a masterpiece. The LGBT community needs more films like this.","Love Simon",7432,3.8,-1.2
"7433",0.5,"  Just another stereotypical Lgbt movie that gives away the main plotline in the movie clips, without even starring any decent actors that you would recognize. Don't waste your time on this crap and go see Black panther instead, so that you don't waste your money, time, and love for the cinema.","Love Simon",7433,3.8,3.3
"7434",5,"  This movie wins for me in almost every category. The script is crisp, the acting is strong, the jokes are funny, the situations are real, and the representation is there. A cast that includes people of color and a few LGBT actors, and comes from such a dynamic place makes the movie feel genuine. Each emotional instance of the movie felt real, it was actual representation, not dramatization. As a gay teen who has experienced the same discrimination, the same issues with coming out, and the same drama with being frightened and worried that people wouldn't be accepting, this movie was truly touching.","Love Simon",7434,3.8,-1.2

"7437",5,"  I loved it. I brought a friend the night before it officially opened and she had no idea anything about the movie.

"7445",4.5,"  I just saw ""Love, Simon"" on its premiere release day, and the movie was absolutely great! The story was well-made, a lot of the characters and the acting were great, and I'm not going to lie you guys this film almost got me emotional. As for the negatives, the pacing was a bit fast throughout the first half, and I hated one of the characters because he was a complete dick who had absolutely no reason to be that way. However, I love this film, and this film definitely serves as an inspiration to the LGBTQ community. And as a LGBTQ supporter, I am inspired because this film helps me and other kids in these types of situations think, ""What will my friends and family think of me if I came out? Will they accept me for who I am, or will I forever be alone because they don't want me to be who I am, and that is myself."" Overall, I give it a 9/10.","Love Simon",7445,3.8,-0.7

"7452",3.5,"  director Greg Berlanti of TV fame makes a movie about something socially relevantbeing gay is tough enough particularly when you have to keep it a secret not just to yourself but others around youit's a scary thing not being who you really are or how much could change after you reveal yourself to the worldwill everyone be okay with it or dislike you for it?that's what Nick Robinson as Simon is struggling with; he has a great life from his family to his friends, the only thing holding him back is that he's gaythere's also a blog where he writes to someone anonymous about his lifestyle so for him it's a relief knowing he's not the only one with something to hideRobinson is excellent In the role next to supporting players by Alexandra Shipp, Jennifer Garner, Logan Miller, and Josh DuhamelBerlanti makes a film not just for the gay community and even though it doesn't fully emcompass the lifestyle he still says anyone can fall in loveyou don't have to be straight to have a happy ending, nobody wants to live in a world where you can't be who you are truly, and it's easy to feel cut off and isolated if you have no one to share your storyin this genre of coming-of-age tales more stories like this need to be presented since there are so many out there who may be going through the same ordealsthe young actors are really good but I do wish the plot went in a different direction, it's one of those cases where the trailers lied and this does have the makings of a made-for-TV productionstill, it's a big gamechanger that needs to exist more these days","Love Simon",7452,3.8,0.3

"7460",5,"  Great movie. Definitely captures the coming out experience well!","Love Simon",7460,3.8,-1.2
"7461",4,"  Love, Simon is a step closer to a hopefully peaceful and accepting society; however, it's fluff. It does help to normalize and show the homosexual perspective, though it struggles to show depth and pain. I will admit I shed a few tears, but I also shed a few tears simply because Simon was more accepted than how most LGBTQ+ teens are today. It's beautiful, and a milestone, but I need another mainstream teen movie that goes into the suffering of how we're really treated, rather than the glitter.","Love Simon",7461,3.8,-0.2

"7469",5,"  I have seen this movie twice. Once at a free screening and once just yesterday. This is a great movie! Have there been other better coming of age coming out movies? Of course but the very fact that this movie is playing nationwide really puts a great spotlight on our culture. There are a lot of lessons to learn in this movie for all kinds of people. I think that the most important one is that who you are attracted to is only one facet of your life. He did everything that every other teenage boy did and the only difference is that he happens to be gay. I think that this movie will help a lot of young people who are having a hard time coming to terms with their sexuality. To top it off. It's a very warmhearted and funny movie! I am really looking forward to owning it on bluray down the road as it is sure to be a cult classic!","Love Simon",7469,3.8,-1.2

"7472",5,"  Love,Simon Is an amazing moving that is going to inspire and help so many young kids out their come to terms and realize who they are. This movie is so powerful and so accurate to what it's like for a good handful of LGBT people and I'm so happy and proud to be alive to see this kind of movie be played in theaters.. I would have never of dreamed of seeing this day..All my life I've dealt with the same and similar things that took place in this movie and I am so happy that someone out there who is young is gonna see this movie and their whole life is gonna change because of it.. I wish I could have had a movie out like this when I was a child because things would have been a lot different in my process of not only coming out to others but to myself. Love, Simon is truly a remarkable film and one to definitely see no matter if your Gay, Straight, Bi, Lesbian, Trans, etc. This is the perfect representation of how it feels to be someone who is LGBTQ and what we go through in life. I couldn't be more proud.Thank you to everyone who put their time and hearts into this movie. You all are amazing and this movie is truly going to change the world.Love, Roman","Love Simon",7472,3.8,-1.2

"7474",5,"  This movie was amazing to watch with my friends. I definitely recommend watching it when you can and if you need inspiration on how to overcome something's.

"7478",5,"  This film was an amazing look into a part of life that so few must endure. Of course it was humerous, well-written, and featured actors who were brilliant to watch. More importantly, though, this movie portrayed a terrifying time in someone's life without cheapening the story with cliches or pandering to any one group. It was beautiful in its simplicity, and extremely moving. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone. I look forward to purchasing multiple copies of the Blu Ray when it is released, after I've seen it a few more times, that is.","Love Simon",7478,3.8,-1.2

"7482",5,"  literally best movie i have ever seen. all other movies are bad by comparison. this movie will save lives!!!","Love Simon",7482,3.8,-1.2
"7483",4.5,"  For the majority i enjoyed the movie extensively. they got a lot of things right in terms of how it is to be gay and that not all gay men are raging flamboyants, its not always obvious. just looking through simon's eyes seeing how confusing it is to figure out whether someone liked him or not simply because he was unsure if they even swung that way gave a lot of insight. There were a few things i wasn't agreeing with because in a sense the movie gave him a fairy tale ending which isn't always the case. the way high school felt also wasn't very realistic 100% but regardless still enjoyable to watch the movie.","Love Simon",7483,3.8,-0.7
"7484",5,"  I did not expect this movie to hit so close to home, but it did and I am speechless. This is the movie that we deserve","Love Simon",7484,3.8,-1.2
"7485",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing! It's a wonderful coming-of-age story that leaves you feeling happier when you've left it. I've already bought my ticket to see it for the second time, and am planning to see it a third. Definitely watch this film!!","Love Simon",7485,3.8,-1.2
"7486",5,"  Not your typical highschool drama. Highschool is actually realistic and personally relatable to me. The acting and writing is very well done. Enjoyable not just for members of the gay community. Strongly recommend.","Love Simon",7486,3.8,-1.2
"7487",5,"  Love, Simon was good. Was so happy to see all the people at the movie and all the girls get gitty and teary eyed. A lot of the themes portrayed in the movie we have all been through, and just remembering all of it. %[%spoiler alert%]The nerves, the anxiety, the did I do something right or did I just make a terrible mistake. Someone else holding knowing your secret and having to come out when your not ready all of this hit home. I did get a little teary eyed. We need more movies like this!","Love Simon",7487,3.8,-1.2
"7488",5,"  I loved this movie so much it made me cry and laugh could relate to it so much. Only wish it came out earlier","Love Simon",7488,3.8,-1.2
"7489",4.5,"  This is a groundbreaking movie that is more than just that title. The movie itself is very lighthearted, and among the best teen rom coms. The plot is good and the mystery is well done. Nick Robinson shines as Simon Spier, showing what it is truly like to be a closeted teen in modern days. His struggles are not with his sexuality, but in his fear of how the people he loves will change once they learn his secret. That was my favorite part of the movie, showing that being in the closet doesn't mean that you are weak, but that it's just trying to figure out the timing and not wanting to possibly have to let go of the good things you already have. I loved this movie, it is long overdue and very well done. I hope that there are more movies that follow in the steps of Love, Simon. Thank you for this one.","Love Simon",7489,3.8,-0.7
"7490",5,"  A truly amazing and heartwarming movie. As a young gay adult who struggled coming out to friends and family, 'Love, Simon' brought many flashbacks of pain and joy, heartaches and pure moments of happiness. I clapped, I laughed, and I cried with the entire movie theater. Thank you to the cast and crew who brought to life such an inspiring story. Step outside this dark and narrow closet of shame and repression. Be who you are. Be happy. Live.","Love Simon",7490,3.8,-1.2
"7491",5,"  Read the book. LOVED! Saw the movie. LOVED! A mainstream movie with gay lead that doesn't end in disaster or sadness? Long overdue. I only wish my teenage self could have read the book/seen the movie. It would have changed my life. Gay. Straight. Somewhere in between. All will love this movie.","Love Simon",7491,3.8,-1.2
"7492",4.5,"  I heard great things about the book when it first came out, but never got the chance to read it, so I knew very little going in. But Love, Simon, supposedly the first LGBT teen romance released by a major studio, is a massive win. Charming, sweet, heartfelt, and funny without being insensitive. Some of the big jokes were released in the trailer, but there were plenty of other memorable lines. The story is modern and new, but at the same time has this classic feel. And it does an excellent job at capturing the spirit and struggles of teenagers in 2018.Nick Robinson as Simon is a star. Subtle, but bright nonetheless. He is endearing and instantly lovable--it is impossible not to root for Simon and this great love story he wants and so desperately deserves.My only complaint is that there were elements that were extremely predictable. I could see some of the ""twists"" coming almost from the beginning. But with the added mystery element to the story, the film is still exciting and interesting enough to keep you engaged and on your toes until the very end.This movie feels like a breath of fresh air. I haven't smiled this big walking out of a movie theater in a while. I hope Love, Simon becomes the standard for the teen movies of the future, and major studios continue to release sweet, lovely, wonderful gay teen romances like this one. The world could probably use just a couple more.","Love Simon",7492,3.8,-0.7
"7493",5,"  This movie was exceptional. This movie was important. Progress meets entertainment in Love, Simon. I applaud those that took a risk on this film; I wish I could thank them in person. It meant a lot to me personally to see this as a new wide-release film.","Love Simon",7493,3.8,-1.2
"7494",5,"  I read the book a bit back and normally hate book to movie adaptations. Normally they get rid of vey important scenes as well just don't portray the books scenes well but Simon and his friends were EVERYTHING they were in the books. Of course some thing could have been better but it was everything I had hoped for and more!","Love Simon",7494,3.8,-1.2
"7495",5,"  I read the book, Simon vs. the Homo Sapien Agenda, and the movie was just as good which never happens. Simon is so adorable. Both of my kids loved it too. Highly recommended!","Love Simon",7495,3.8,-1.2
"7496",5,"  A well done, funny, sweet film. The story of a young man who has a 'secret' he's afraid to share with even his closest friends is well acted brings both laughter and tears. The reaction of his classmates runs the gamut of emotions and the audience is drawn in by the portrayal of this young man's struggle not only with navigating high school but doing so while trying to guard his secret. A very good way to spend an evening.","Love Simon",7496,3.8,-1.2
"7497",5,"  Fantastic film. Beautiful characters. A deeply moving and lovely coming of age movie we can all relate to.","Love Simon",7497,3.8,-1.2
"7498",5,"  ""Love, Simon"" was a fantastic film, it was so great that I saw the film twice and went back to Walmart to buy a third copy of the book just to show support. I'll admit it had a rushed feeling but I can understand why since they're squeezing so much in a film. Overall it was a great 10/10 film (In my opinion) and it's one of my favorite movies.","Love Simon",7498,3.8,-1.2
"7499",4.5,"  IT was great .A MIllion times better than the book hands down. I was very excited being able to view the movie a week early.","Love Simon",7499,3.8,-0.7
"7500",5,"  (minor spoilers!) I was skeptical since the movie seemed so overhyped, but it proved me wrong and was very enjoyable and pleasant. The characters seemed real and like real people for the most part, which is important. The plot was very good and had depth to it. And I loved how Simon continued to love Blue no matter who he thought he was, showing that he loved his personality and that who he was didn't matter. Overall it was very good, I loved the emotion in all the characters and thought the movie was really really sweet. It was a very good movie and plan on seeing it again!","Love Simon",7500,3.8,-1.2
"7501",5,"  Heartwarming movie, with lots of charm avout real life. A must see","Love Simon",7501,3.8,-1.2
"7502",4,"  I'll admit before I write this review that I'm somewhat biased towards this movie as a queer teen. At times it can be a bit shallow in regards to character and certain emotional moments, but for the most part, Love, Simon is an emotional love story and hits certain beats that can make almost all audiences feel sympathy for Simon. Truly, Love, Simon is a fantastic movie and has perfected accurate representation.","Love Simon",7502,3.8,-0.2
"7503",5,"  Beautiful and hilarious and emotional and magical and relatable and so so important. Queer kids need this. We all need it. My cheeks hurt from smiling so much.","Love Simon",7503,3.8,-1.2
"7504",5,"  Was shocked at how packed the theater was. Very good movie","Love Simon",7504,3.8,-1.2
"7505",5,"  this movie was absolutely the best movie i have ever seen, and i think it is so amazing that they have finally made a movie like this.","Love Simon",7505,3.8,-1.2
"7506",4.5,"  Excellent script, excellent cast (especially the younger performers) & a winning performance by Nick Robinson make this film shine. Smart, funny, deep.","Love Simon",7506,3.8,-0.7
"7507",5,"  I love this movie. It is being compared to Call Me By Your Name but I think a better comparison would be with Ladybird. Love, Simon is as refreshing and wonderful as Ladybird. Nick Robinson and the rest of the cast are outstanding. This film is sweet, funny, positive, and affirming. I wish there had been positive films like this when I was in school.","Love Simon",7507,3.8,-1.2
"7508",5,"  A film with heart and a story that is important to tell. With relatable characters, a very well-written script, and groundbreaking treatment of LGBTQ+ characters, ""Love, Simon"" shows that there needs to be more films like it.","Love Simon",7508,3.8,-1.2
"7509",5,"  This movie gave me the strength to come out to my dad. It was heartfelt and funny and charming. The whole audience was so involved they laughed and cried and literally clapped at the end. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.","Love Simon",7509,3.8,-1.2
"7510",5,"  I really, really loved this movie. It has a John Huges, 80s feel to it which I really vibed with. Plus the story was really sweet and compelling. I was kinda pissed that another lead LGBT+ character role went to a Straight actor, but the movie's remaining cast is very diverse and fairly queer. I recommend that everyone go see this film. It is just a good movie!","Love Simon",7510,3.8,-1.2
"7511",5,"  'Love, Simon' is a wonderful and amazing experience. Although I wouldn't reccomend it to ages 10 and under, I will definitely reccomend it for everyone else. 'Love, Simon' did a great job at sticking to reality. By that I mean that it didn't go overboard with the potential it has, there is a fine line between too much and just enough for a good coming of age movie, and 'Love, Simon' hits that fine line. The jokes where up to date and very funny. However, it is a tear jerker, not all for sadness, mostly happiness. If you're even thinking of going to see this movie, you should!","Love Simon",7511,3.8,-1.2
"7512",5,"  I was very, very impressed by this movie. I've seen a few teenage coming-of-age films over the years, and this film blew all out those out of the water. To start off, its very well done. From the writing, to the progression of the story, to the acting of the cast, I was very impressed by the overall quality of it. A lot of thought went into trying to render the film believable and honest, and it shows in the final cut. The movie is also surprisingly funny! I was honestly shocked by how funny it was. The dialogue is really witty and any scene involving the drama teacher is absolutely hilarious. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Between the honesty and hilarity of the script, and the effortless flow of the movie, I would highly recommend it. I think everyone can enjoy this film as well. When I saw it the audience ranged from teenage girls to married couples, and everyone seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Bottom line, I highly recommend it!","Love Simon",7512,3.8,-1.2
"7513",5,"  Really enjoyed it. A great start for the previously non-existent genre of gay rom-com; hope to see many more in the future.","Love Simon",7513,3.8,-1.2

"7519",5,"  It's a cute love story. Fro. Start to finish it's all in good spirits. Great soundtrack to it. All the actures were great. Good direction. Made me cry ?? which says a lot. For sure one of my favorites.","Love Simon",7519,3.8,-1.2
"7520",4.5,"  I really love this movie I thought it wasn't going to be as good as it was I thought it was going to be just a classic romcom but with someone who is gay. Turns out this was much better then I expected, the emotion, the love, just everything was amazing. One of the main things I really liked was how there was no toxic masculinity, the dad had emotion and felt bad that his son had to go through this and he didn't see it sooner to help him. The only toxic masculinity were 2 boys who were called out and I really loved that. I also think the actors do a fantastic job. The only part I didn't like was the end I don't want to give a spoiler but Simon was basically pressuring blue to come out and that was the only part that got me I understand what Simon was doing and I feel for him but at the same time that was not the way to do it tho the ending when he came was so amazing and cute????","Love Simon",7520,3.8,-0.7
"7521",5,"  I cried, laughed, and clapped. What a heartfelt movie","Love Simon",7521,3.8,-1.2
"7522",5,"  Best romantic movie hollywood has made since 'The Notebook!""","Love Simon",7522,3.8,-1.2
"7523",5,"  Love, Simon is so genuine, gentle, and hilarious. I didn't expect to relate, because other than also being gay, my background is so different, but I really connected to Simon, and it was so amazing to finally see someone on screen whose struggles somehow felt connected to mine.","Love Simon",7523,3.8,-1.2
"7524",5,"  Love, Simon is absolutely revolutionary. The representation and diversity doesn't feel forced, but works naturally with a brilliant storyline. I can't wait to watch it again, and I hope to see more films like it emerge in the future.","Love Simon",7524,3.8,-1.2
"7525",5,"  Hope to see more of these kids.","Love Simon",7525,3.8,-1.2
"7526",4.5,"  Was a coming of age beneath the shadows and more real than most teen movies, please go see it just so more movies like it can be made!","Love Simon",7526,3.8,-0.7
"7527",1,"  More hype than anything. If you have seen many LGBT movies before you will think this wasn't even close to being the best LGBT movie.","Love Simon",7527,3.8,2.8
"7528",5,NA,"Love Simon",7528,3.8,-1.2
"7529",5,"  Saw this movie last night in Omaha with some friends and it is now one of my favorite movies! I could watch this movie again and again with its funny humor, serious topics, real life issues, relateable subjects, emotional scenes, and scenes that just make you feel happy inside. I would deffiently recommend this movie to anyone out there. You can learn a lot from this movie and it deserves to be watched by many. ??","Love Simon",7529,3.8,-1.2
"7530",2.5,"  After seeing Love, Simon I want a refund on my adolescence because I didn't have a movie that would have so beautifully encapsulated what I was going through. Bravo for this wonderful film.","Love Simon",7530,3.8,1.3
"7531",0.5,"  This was not the best movie. Thought it would be better. Not really into gay movies","Love Simon",7531,3.8,3.3

"7533",4,"  I really enjoyed this movie! However, the book, Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens? Agenda by Becky Albertalli is amazing and I highly recommend reading that even if you?ve already seen the movie.","Love Simon",7533,3.8,-0.2
"7534",3.5,"  Though not nearly as new as it pretends to be and a bit too ideal at times, Love Simon is a welcome alternative to the scores of overwrought melodramas that tackle the same subject, and successfully achieves palatability due to its warm characters, great cast, and casual humor.","Love Simon",7534,3.8,0.3
"7535",5,"  Speechless! I would watch it over an over again..","Love Simon",7535,3.8,-1.2
"7536",5,"  went to see this with my girlfriend last night. I was fairly skeptical beforehand since, as a nonbinary lesbian, it's beyond obvious when an LGBTQ+ character-- let alone the main character-- is written by a cisgender/heterosexual person. But goddamn. Love, Simon surpasses the stereotypical portrayals of the queer experience with flying colors (yes, pun intended). I never anticipated loving it as much as I do. Truly a brilliant film.","Love Simon",7536,3.8,-1.2
"7537",5,"  Great coming of age coming out story.","Love Simon",7537,3.8,-1.2
"7538",5,"  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. THIS MOVIE TO DEATH!","Love Simon",7538,3.8,-1.2
"7539",5,"  The underlying message of this movie is something that makes people think. The love story makes people feel. The power of Love, Simon is universal.","Love Simon",7539,3.8,-1.2
"7540",5,"  Awesome movie. It covers all of the anxiety of coming out and the fear around it in without dealving intovthe super depressing feelings many of us deal with. Would watch again","Love Simon",7540,3.8,-1.2
"7541",5,"  Amazing Movie, it shows the struggle people have while figuring out their sexuality, but most importantly it shows how the process of ""coming out"" should be normalized. Overall great movie and amazing cast.","Love Simon",7541,3.8,-1.2
"7542",5,"  As someone who has never written a film review in my life, Love, Simon has sparked me to do so. It's a film simple in its plot, but hits you on so many emotional levels. It isn't merely a rom-com filled with hysterical roasts and that ""trying-to-figure-things-out"" vibe that often dominates teenage life, but also resonates the struggle of being unaccepted--the excruciating wonder of ""what would happen"" if I came out, ""what if"" they knew this about me, or ""would things change"" if I just let it all out? Both the sense of exasperating dread before coming out and the awkward relief after saying ""I'm gay"" rings true throughout the extent of Love, Simon. Thank you for making this, and let me just say... finally.","Love Simon",7542,3.8,-1.2
"7543",5,"  I laughed a lot, I cried a lot, and I absolutely loved this movie.","Love Simon",7543,3.8,-1.2
"7544",5,"  Beautiful movie! Laughed, cried, and just loved every part of it! Definitely in the teen romcom genre (in a similar way to The Fault in Our Stars) but a great movie nonetheless.","Love Simon",7544,3.8,-1.2
"7545",5,"  I'm a lgbtq+ kid and the representation literally made me shake with emotion. This is now my favorite movie!","Love Simon",7545,3.8,-1.2
"7546",5,"  Amazing, wonderful movie. I loved it.","Love Simon",7546,3.8,-1.2
"7547",5,"  I laughed, I cried, I celebrated, I was thankful. It addressed so many of the key issues associated with coming out including the bullying. A film that will help so many young people facing their own ""coming out"" and help them realize it is not really all that scary any more. You still can be you!","Love Simon",7547,3.8,-1.2
"7548",5,"  This movie was SO amazing! The beginning was very lighthearted and featured a bit of ""comedy"" like scenes. I didn't expect to cry as much as I did though! So amazing, definitely recommend","Love Simon",7548,3.8,-1.2
"7549",5,"  Got dragged to this last Saturday. Definitely made for straight people(not necessarily a bad thing) and I enjoyed it way more than I expected. The biggest thing this movie does well is humanize.Nothing too original or different. Great movie for anyone to see no matter their sexual preference.","Love Simon",7549,3.8,-1.2
"7550",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing. If you want a unique yet relatable coming out story, I definitely recommend! It really touches on a subject that mainstream movies never deal with, and in my opinion, there should be more movies like this from now on.","Love Simon",7550,3.8,-1.2
"7551",1.5,"  I have waited for this kind of movie for years. As a gay high schooler, I had really high hopes for this. It had some good parts. But it was written for a straight audience. I never felt myself within the character, despite Simon and I being almost the exact same person. I cried with disappointment on the ride home than I did while watching the movie I'm not saying that this movie isn't for anyone, it serves as a great stepping stone for straight people to understand the struggles of coming out. But that's the issue. It's for straight people. Not the gays who have waited for movies like this since the dawn of time.","Love Simon",7551,3.8,2.3
"7552",5,"  Love Simon was the Gay Romcom we all deserved. As an absolute, fellow queer myself I hav meassive respect and appreciation for what they did. The score was beautiful, the characters were complex, interesting and, for the most part, lovable. The story was absolutely brilliant and so realistically gay. Simon is not just his coming out story,Simon is Simon and he just happens to be gay. I know kids will see this and be able to know ""I'm okay. I'm going to be okay."" I hope every questioning, or queer, or LGBT+ child gets to see this movie and see themselves in it. Perhaps, if I had had such realistic and well made representation in my childhood I would have figured out I was gay a lot sooner.I cried, I laughed, I cheered and I hope more movies will see love Soimon as an example to follow and I get more gay romcoms to watch.","Love Simon",7552,3.8,-1.2
"7553",4.5,"  Warm, fuzzy film. Really enjoyed it but also don't think it's top notch.","Love Simon",7553,3.8,-0.7
"7554",5,"  I'm an out and proud gay teenager, and this is the cliche teen love story movie I feel like I've been waiting for my whole life. Everything resonated with me, from the subaru outback (i have the same car), to the sexual awakening stories (mine was Taylor Swift). This movie made me laugh, made me cry, and I walked out of the theater happier than I've ever been after seeing a movie. 'Love, Simon,' is an amazing movie.","Love Simon",7554,3.8,-1.2
"7555",5,"  This is the movie that I needed when I was a young queer teenager.","Love Simon",7555,3.8,-1.2

"7558",1,"  Made for TV movie. Not sure how it got to the theaters.","Love Simon",7558,3.8,2.8
"7559",4.5,"  A great coming out story. My only complaint was Waffle House scene which was a little over the top and unbelievable. Otherwise, a very true to life story and refreshing in the fact that the majority of the conflict for Simon was internal rather than from an external soure.","Love Simon",7559,3.8,-0.7
"7560",3,"  Although it presented an interesting take on the usually stupid and boring teen romance genre as well as some good dialogue, the film's sappy ending and extremely dumb and predictable final reveal prove it has not been able to reach beyond the stereotypes for this kind of movie.","Love Simon",7560,3.8,0.8
"7561",4,"  A romatic comedy that is at time moving but did not break new ground in terms of story telling; it's actually quite predictable. Promoted as a first gay film from a major studio; but regrettably just like Call Me By Your Name the main gay character is played by straight actor.","Love Simon",7561,3.8,-0.2
"7562",5,"  Loved this movie! I laughed, cried, and felt myself cheering Siomon on.","Love Simon",7562,3.8,-1.2
"7563",5,"  Quintessential coming of age movie for a new generation. It's refreshing and adorable.","Love Simon",7563,3.8,-1.2
"7564",5,"  My favorite movies are those that make me laugh AND cry, sometimes at the same time. ""Love, Simon"" did just that. It had many themes that anyone with kids in the middle school to college age-range will benefit from seeing. I came away with, not only the satisfaction of seeing a great movie, but also a number of things I want to talk to my daughter about as she moves into her teen years. The highs and lows of young love, peer pressure, friendships, and more are coming her way.","Love Simon",7564,3.8,-1.2
"7565",5,"  beautifully made movie. i hope that future generations looks back on this movie and recognize it as the pivoting point where movies targeted at teenagers became so diverse and accepting. the movie was so beautifully directed, produced, scored, and acted. all young actors and so amazingly talented. this movie is giving so many teenagers and kids the courage to come and be true to themselves and i think that's very hard to achieve by just watching a movie, but that shows just how groundbreaking this movie was. will definitely watch again and again as a pick me up whenever i'm feeling down","Love Simon",7565,3.8,-1.2
"7566",5,"  This hit all the right spots...i laughed, I cried and I want his parents. It made me feel like way back when I used to watch Cant Buy Me Love. This us a new classic for me.","Love Simon",7566,3.8,-1.2
"7567",5,"  This movie was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I laughed, cried, and got so into this movie I forgot I was even watching a movie. The acting was so amazing I thought I was there, and the story line has made me want to go out and buy the book, Simon vs the homo sapiens agenda. This movie is a must see for anyone teen and up!","Love Simon",7567,3.8,-1.2
"7568",5,"  I thought it was realistic, funny and heartwarming. All the actors did a great job. The soundtrack was awesome as well. One of the best movies I've seen this year.","Love Simon",7568,3.8,-1.2
"7569",5,"  HOLY SHITT!!! That was wonderfull, so heartwarming. I cried throughout the 80% of it. Even if you have read the book, still see the movie they are so different in the completely right ways. I LOVE IT!","Love Simon",7569,3.8,-1.2
"7570",5,"  This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Extremely well written and the acting was amazing. I don't write reviews I usually just tell people about movies when they ask. I am a huge Marvel fan and this movie in my opinion tops Marvel for me. It really pulls you into the movie and hits to home in so many ways. Yes I recommend this movie to everyone.","Love Simon",7570,3.8,-1.2
"7571",5,"  Just saw the movie and I loved it. Definitely, recommend!!","Love Simon",7571,3.8,-1.2
"7572",5,"  I am obsessed with this movie, the amount of times I cried because of the jokes or cried because of the situations the characters were in is amazing. The characters feel very real and i was immediately attached to them, Some of the dialogue from the kids is a little cringe (they said outdated slang like HJ and stuff but that's just a nitpick), but for the most part they act pretty realistic. There were parts where I was feeling extremely anxious Because Simon was put in a situation that I (and many other LGBT+ people) are very framiliar with. I know how it felt to be in that exact situation. As a gay man this hit very close to home and I'm sure other many LGBTQ+ people will be able to heavily relate to Simon's journey. This movie will forever be one of my favorites, I can feel it!","Love Simon",7572,3.8,-1.2
"7573",5,"  One of the absolutely BEST movies I have seen in a very, very long time. Perfect mix of LOL funny, heartwarming and touching, amazing writing has edge-of-your-seat twists that have you guessing ""who is it??""up until the very end. This really is a MUST SEE.","Love Simon",7573,3.8,-1.2
"7574",5,"  Saw special showing last saturday it was great it felt like a John Hughes movie! ?? ?? ?? I can't wait to see it again.","Love Simon",7574,3.8,-1.2
"7575",5,"  One of the greatest love story's of all time. This film is absolutely phenomenal and is a joy to watch.","Love Simon",7575,3.8,-1.2
"7576",5,"  This has got to be the first time I thoroughly enjoyed a teen romance movie. The story was sweet, yet it also touched on cyber bullying, the importance of family and friends, racial diversity, stereotypes, and the multi-layered challenges involved in coming out. It was very well done, and it also left you feeling touched. It was more complex than I expected, and it had a nice blend of humor and drama. It was a nice update to the story of teen love, and it tackled gay love in a manner that wasn't a cliche.","Love Simon",7576,3.8,-1.2
"7577",5,"  Perfect jumble of emotional range! Great for anybody!","Love Simon",7577,3.8,-1.2
"7578",5,"  YALL THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD!!!! I laughed and cried which proves it's a great movie. Highly recommend","Love Simon",7578,3.8,-1.2

"7580",4.5,"  This movie made me smile, laugh and cry!","Love Simon",7580,3.8,-0.7
"7581",4,"  Love, Simon was a funny and heartwarming romcom which definitely broke down a wall. After reading the book, I was somewhat nervous going into Love, Simon as movies based on books usually have major differences and that somewhat frustrates me, which is why I was presently surprised after the movie was over. Some scenes are almost exactly the same. Nick Robinson's performance as the title character was very emotional and entertaining and I really can't picture anyone else portraying Simon. Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. were also great. Although I wouldn't really call Love, Simon a full on comedy, some moments were absolutely hilarious and made the movie more entertaining. This movie also felt realistic, not some soapy romance movie that had to end in some tragic twist, it felt real. There were a few confusing moments and I felt like they could have shown more and talked about more of the messages that were sent between Simon and Blue, but it didn't drastically affect the film. With a great cast, positive messages about being who you are and not letting people drag you down, and hilarious moments, Love, Simon was a very enjoyable and heartfelt experience that I will gladly watch again. 85%","Love Simon",7581,3.8,-0.2
"7582",5,"  Of course it's never easy to come out, and it makes me so happy that the movie got every detail of the emotions right. It was so hard since I was 12 to live with that huge ass secret. If I were 16 in 2001, it would've been completely different. I always thought, nobody can know that I'm gay. I just can't believe that the world has changed so much over the years.","Love Simon",7582,3.8,-1.2
"7583",5,"  It's been 25 years since Philadelphia. This should be the subtitled: ""A John Hugh's movie for the modern age"". The characters are quirky and likeable. There is that teen party without adult supervision. Love Simon has some whip funny lines. The performances are all strong. Nick Robinson as the titular character is particularly empathy-worthy. There have been a number of gay youth coming of age movies over the years, and my main worry half way through this one is that it would not have the wounded angst that makes a movie of this type hurt so good. Alas not to worry. The open heartache is slightly gut wrenching. And the movie nicely rounds out to salve it all over. I was expecting a Biloxi Blue's reveal but was pleasantly surprised once again. For tonality, I like that this one is slightly lighter than that genre cousin, ""Perk of Being a Wallflower"". I know it was a preview screening, but it was one of the first times I have had an audience applaud since the Hulk tossed Loki around in Avengers. Enough of referencing other movies. I will mention an old trope of mine. It's about movie rhythm; The beginning, middle, ending and pacing; The lack of meaningless car-chases which are pretty much not a part of anyone's real life. These are the things that help make a movie good, and this one great.","Love Simon",7583,3.8,-1.2
"7584",4.5,"  I really loved the movie for its amazing humor and the emotion it showed. I could understand how the characters felt like i was one of them and that was nice. It also made me cry several times which not a lot and rarely ever happen when I watch movies. Overall it was amazeballs and I sure am glad I decided to go watch it.","Love Simon",7584,3.8,-0.7

"7587",0.5,"  For anyone that is mildly interested in this movie as an adaptation from the book Simon Vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda, it fails miserably in most aspects. The only things that I feel this movie adapted correctly from the book are the character's physical appearances-- which are mediocre at best (they didn't even make Bieber a Golden Retriever). The rest of the movie, in my opinion, is so extremely subpar that I could barely follow the storyline and I've read the book multiple times. My roommate, who hasn't read the book, and I went to see it today and-- I kid you not-- they mention Bram's name, Nora's name, Garrett's name, and Nick's name a total of two times each at the maximum. The end of the movie rolled around and the big reveal for Blue (which failed miserably because everyone already knew who Blue was because the writers of the movie literally made Blue and Simon have a conversation about Halloween Oreos and then Bram turned around not even 3 minutes later and commented on Simon's Halloween Oreos at lunch) and my roommate literally turned to me and asked me who Blue was because Bram has so little screen time. The characters personalities also fall so incredibly flat that you find yourself liking Martin Addison only because he's the only character that develops any kind of personality. No, wait, I take that back. There's a character names Lyle (Yes, I know that name sounds incredibly unfamiliar to you. That would be because Lyle doesn't exist in the books.) that Simon believes is Blue for a short time-- which is utter bullshit because Simon knows that Blue goes to Creekwood and Lyle works at the Waffle House-- until they have a conversation and Lyle asks if Abby is single. I kid you not when I tell you that I think Bella from the Twilight movies had more character than Bram/Blue.Now, if you're thinking ""that's not too bad. I'm sure I'll understand the characters. I read the book and the movie probably stays true to the book"" no. You're wrong. I can count on one hand all the ways the movie stays true to the book: the characters names are all the same, Martin blackmails Simon (but he's much more aggressive and outright about it being a blackmail than he was in the book and doesn't try to deny it), Bram posts on the Tumblr page (but he does not write an ocean metaphor, instead he talks about a ferris wheel because the movie had to make a big deal out of a ferris wheel at the end when Bram and Simon ride together. Yeah, you read correctly, they ride a ferris wheel. Not a Tilt-A-Whirl.), Simon finds out that it's Bram when they meet at the carnival (but again, ferris wheel) and Simon and Bram have the same math class. That's it. That is all the accuracy you're going to get from the book.Now, let's talk inaccuracy. Not only does the movie make pointless changes like making Nora a baker (what?) and never holding the talent show, making Simon a senior in High school with a dream of college in LA (what?), and introducing a random Vice Principal that is unneeded and only there so everyone in the theater can laugh at how stupid he is. It also changes major plot elements. Leah, the anime loving, gay obsessed friend that is in love with Nick? Nah. She's in love with Simon and doesn't give two craps out anime or yaoi. In fact, she's not even emotionally repressed like in the book. Nah, she tries to tell Simon that she loves him. In fact, she gets mad at Simon (not for going to hang out with Abby and Nick without her because the whole gay bar scene/getting drunk and going back for the shirt scene/ getting grounded never happens) because Simon (who is incredibly off character for the Simon I loved in the books) gets her a date with Nick to try and keep Abby and Nick apart because HE IS ACTIVELY MESSING WITH HIS FRIENDS' LIVES IN THE MOVIE. Which is why Abby and Nick are mad at Simon in the movie-- because he was a major asshole and lied to his friends to keep them apart and help Martin. Speaking of Martin, he's the only character in the whole cast that I ended up liking, which is entirely wrong because he's a blackmailing asshole. They give him this big redemption scene with Abby and Simon at the Waffle House where he makes Abby believe that she deserves a ""superhero"" for a dad instead of who she got and then they make him a bullying victim because when he asks Abby to date him on the field at homecoming (You read that right, he steals the microphone from Taylor Metternich at homecoming during the National Anthem and asks Abby to date him with doves and everything) the entire school picks on him for failing. That's why he outs Simon in the movie-- because he got shot down and needed something to take the negative attention off of him. Now, you might be wondering how Simon and Blue stop talking if Simon never gets grounded for getting drunk (""But he gets drunk in the trailer?"" you say? Well, his parents apparently don't care because he didn't drive and is home before curfew.). Well, let me tell you, BLUE BLOCKS SIMON AFTER HE'S OUTED. You heard me. Gentle, kind, loving Blue blocks Simon's email because he's afraid of being out, but don't worry he's already told his family. So, I guess he just doesn't want the school to know until the very end when he rides the ferris wheel with Simon while the whole school watches because Simon posted an open announcement on the Tumblr page to get Blue there and apparently no one in the city had anything better to do than stand there for hours and watch Simon ride a ferris wheel while he waits for Blue. Okay..... sure. Now, let's talk Cal because surely they had to get one character right, right? Nah. Cal has like 5 speaking parts that amount to ""I'm going away for Christmas."" and ""No. I'm not Blue. Sorry, Simon"". The scene where they push each other on rolling chairs down halls? Never happens. The scene where Cal tells Simon he's Bi and asks him out? Never happens. Every scene with Cal ever? Never happens. Then how does Simon think Blue is Cal, you ask? Well, because he says he's going away to the middle of nowhere for Christmas and Blue also CONVENIENTLY is going away to a lake house with no wifi (which doesn't happen, but whatever.) It's fine though because he only thinks it's Cal for approximately five minutes before he's told otherwise. Whatever. The emails? They're about as long as texts and equally as irrelevant. Simon and Blue discuss little to nothing and, because of this, their entire relationship falls flat.Now, let's talk specific details they missed. Simon doesn't wear glasses. Bieber isn't a golden retriever. Nora isn't in a band. Alice doesn't exist. Blue doesn't ever mention his nauseation. There is no Tilt-A-Whirl. Garrett doesn't like Leah. There is no Mr. Wise and no english class. Ms. Albright is not redheaded, but African American. Nick doesn't play guitar. Abby doesn't take the bus to school (Simon picks her up because she lives in town). The cute shopping/eating Oreos scene never happens with Bram and Simon. There is no Orange Frost or alone time for them (in fact, their onscreen relationship time amounts to about 5 minutes). They do a production of Cabaret, not Oliver! Elliott Smith is never mentioned. Simon's email address is ""outmywindow1."" Nora doesn't ride to school with Simon. Simon's parents let him drive 4 other kids to school. Simon apparently has a Panic! At The Disco love. Leah has a dog. Abby doesn't dance and isn't a cheerleader. Leah doesn't draw. You never seen Bram play soccer or in a soccer uniform. Simon emails Blue onscreen, not before the movie starts like in the book, so I can only assume they've only talked for a few months by the end of the whole movie.Honestly, I'm sure there are more, the entire movie is a long, painfully horrible adaptation of a wonderful book. So, don't go see it if you want to actually watch Simon and Bram fall in love.","Love Simon",7587,3.8,3.3

"7591",5,"  A strong ensemble lead by Nick Robinson. The high schoolers acted and looked like they were actually in high school. The teachers seemed like real people, if tilted to the comedy side. A nice modern tone, light on drama, but emotionally effecting. I want to see it again.","Love Simon",7591,3.8,-1.2
"7592",2,"  More like an After School Special.Initially I thought this is a very good movie but the more I thought about it, the lower my impression was. All the politically correct boxes where checked, white upper middle class, poor black girl from Baltimore, stereotypical over the top gay boy, obnoxious nerd, and the tri-factor of Black, Gay, and Jewish. Nick Robinson did not look 17, yet more like a college senior than high school senior. Jennifer Gardner as the mother/psychotherapist was not very in tune with her own child, and her acting was mediocre at best, and her later response to Simon's coming out was lackluster for a mental health professional, Josh Duhamel, Simon's father played a stereotypical one dimensional post college football jock. The Drama Coach was the funniest character and the Vice principal had 10 more minutes of screen time than necessary. I think my biggest problem was with the lack of response by parents of their sons force outing and more so the lack of repercussions faced by Nick's character. This is a great feel-good movie until you start think back on what you saw.","Love Simon",7592,3.8,1.8

"7598",3,"  Love, Simon is an uplifting and irresistible new coming out story directed by Greg Berlanti. Simon (played by Nick Robinson) plays gay teenager Simon, who is struggling with his sexuality while trying to find out who the mutually gay and anonymous classmate is at his school whom he is chatting with online. Finally, Hollywood has produced a romantic comedy for young LGBT audiences that is refreshing and fun.","Love Simon",7598,3.8,0.8

"7600",4,"  As with Wonder (2017), Love, Simon urges social acceptance within our community. While Wonder, which revolves around social fear and arrogance of those who look different than us, Love, Simon immerses moviegoers in a hotly contested topic that is usually met with an unparalleled amount of hate and cruelty. Yes, brutal honesty, but it's an unfortunate reality. Watching this film doesn't feel as if its pushing an agenda, but urges social acceptance in our schools, families and communities by showcasing the trials and tribulations of a teen trying to understand himself while longing for acceptance. It's worth a watch. After all, everyone deserves a great love story!","Love Simon",7600,3.8,-0.2

"7602",5,"  Love, Simon is so refreshingly wholesome and mainstream for the gay community. I left the theatre, proud to be gay! A wonderful film about family, friends, and a first love. Go see this film!","Love Simon",7602,3.8,-1.2
"7603",4,"  It's a little shocking to think that it took until 2018 to finally have a teen movie whose lead character is gay. We have seen plenty of gay characters on television and in movies before, but they're usually the sassy sidekicks offering moral support to the female protagonist. Love, Simon finally breaks that convention in telling Simon's story. Nick Robinson (Jurassic World) plays the titular character who explains to the audience in his opening narration that he's just like any perfectly normal teenager. He comes from a loving and supportive home and has a close circle of friends. There's just one major secret that he's keeping from them. He knows at the age of seventeen that he's gay. He wouldn't be the first openly gay kid at school as Ethan (Moore) already lives his truth despite the constant mocking he gets from their classmates.The kids at school use a secret online forum to post their inner reflections and juicy hallway gossip. One day Simon reads a message from someone nicknamed ""Blue"" who opens up that he's gay. Simon is somewhat elated in knowing that there's someone else out there at school just like him. Simon creates a fake email and replies back to Blue as ""Jacques."" They begin an email correspondence opening up about their ""when did you know"" stories. It's a safe space for both of them to be who their true selves. Back at school, Simon and his friends go about their days getting ready for homecoming and rehearsing their fall production of Cabaret. Simon starts to look around trying to discover Blue's true identity as he starts to fall in love. Could it be Cabaret's pianist Cal (Heizer), his good friend Bram (Lonsdale), or is it Lyle (Pollari), the waiter at the local Waffle House? It's fun to see Simon's inner thoughts play out as he tries to connect the dots with each guy.Like any good teen flick, Simon's journey to acceptance is not an easy one. Teens can be cruel, and we see that played out here when the emails are found on an school computer. It becomes heartbreaking to watch someone start to come into their own only to witness the negative reaction that comes with it. That's just one of the reasons why Love, Simon works so well. It gets it right. It may be a Hollywood flick, but that doesn't make it out of touch with reality. As Simon and Blue's emails continue, their stories and natural fears ring true to what it's like to discover one's sexuality. I clearly remember that initial fear of how coming out could change everything when you just want your life and relationships to stay the same.In the '80s it was the John Hughes films, and in the '90s we had movies like American Pie, She's All That, or 10 Things I Hate About You. This generation of teens can look upon films like Love, Simon or The Perks of Being a Wallflower to represent their youth. Much like those films, Simon comes with a cast of characters each having their own individual style and personality. It's refreshing to not see a bunch of teen stereotypes. They're all going through something as we see with Simon's best friend Leah, played by Katherine Langford from 13 Reasons Why. They're always together, but Simon's deft ways doesn't allow him to notice that she has a deep crush on him. Nick Robinson is extremely charming as Simon. He's a flawed character, but someone worthy of love. Natasha Rothwell is a scene-stealer as the drama teacher. She has a fantastic scene where we see her put two bullies in their place. Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel also co-star as Simon's loving, and sometimes awkward, parents.Love, Simon has those quintessential grand gestures where some come with rejection while others will have you cheering and applauding loudly from your seat. It's all set against a stellar soundtrack curated by Jack Antonoff. It was refreshing to be in a theater with an audience that was rooting for Simon to fall in love. You could hear and feel the excitement in the air. It was a needed reminder that there is hope and love in this world when it seems like fear, anger, and bullying are ramping up again to dangerous highs. Love, Simon is that perfect movie to help teens, or anyone else, live their truth.Director Greg Berlanti, best known for his work on television with Dawson's' Creek, Brothers & Sisters, and the DC superhero universe on the CW, is an out gay man. I can only assume that his own history helped him navigate this story with just the right touch to keep it grounded. The film starts off fairly easy-going, but there's a turning point in the story that takes it to even greater depth. It's a heartfelt drama with consequences where no character or action felt inauthentic. Characters make stupid decisions and are held accountable. By the end you'll be laughing through the tears, which is how it should be.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Go fall in love with Simon and support these stories.RATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS","Love Simon",7603,3.8,-0.2

"7606",4.5,"  if you have not read the book you will love it so much! If you have read it, you will still love it! While the book is better (in most cases it always is). The movie captures the essence and overall heart of the book. This movie means so much to me as a gay person and it will always be one of my favorite films of all time. Great cast and great acting. Beautiful camera angles/shots. Magnificent story as whole. It's funny, cute, sad and relatable (especially if you're LGBT). It's the pure definition of entertainment! Everyone should go see this movie.","Love Simon",7606,3.8,-0.7
"7607",0.5,"  Love, Simon is a subpar movie that tries to discuss the struggles of coming out. His love story with Blue is a bit far fetched because Simon would not have nervousness to the point he did. While the movie touched really well on how difficult it is to come out, it did a horrible job on the actual love story. If I were to recommend this movie to anyone, which I will not, I would recommend it to a middle school student or a freshman in high school. This movie had the potential to really go in depth about relationships in the LGBTQ community, but failed at doing so.","Love Simon",7607,3.8,3.3

"7610",5,"  A journalist for Time Magazine wrote an article about this movie and stated that teens today don't need this movie; that in 2018 individuals like Simon have a good chance of fitting in, and it is unnecessary. Let me begin by saying he is wrong. This, first off, was a fantastic movie. It had a great mix of comedy, drama, and romance. That is something that is sorely lacking in LGBT film today. Many of them are far to serious and dramatic (""Call me by your name"", ""The Normal Heart"", Etc.) or are so flamboyant and ridiculous that no one can relate to it, but it is still a good movie (""Birdcage""). This is the only film that I have encountered that accurately portrays ones fears of coming out of the closet, and being in the closet trying to just survive high school. What this Time writer doesn't realize is that coming out is not just about ""fitting in"". In fact, many individuals coming out in high school worry because they are essentially painting a target on their back for bullying. It's terrifying because there are ultraconservative parents who kick their children out based on sexual orientation. Friends that get weird because they think ""What if this person thinks of me in that way?"". Coming out changes the dynamic between you and the people around you, and some people become hostile towards LGBT youth. Whenever I myself came out with my first boyfriend on Facebook someone from his friends list messaged me and told me ""What you are doing is wrong"". The fact that someone who is a complete stranger felt comfortable confronting me on my sexual orientation and thought it was their business to lecture me was just absurd. But anyway, as Simon said in the trailer for the movie, ""announcing who you are to the world can be pretty scary"", and I think really that is why this film is important. It reminds people that while coming out is terrifying, all that matters is that you are happy with who you are.","Love Simon",7610,3.8,-1.2

You aren't going to exactly relate to one of the characters but you'll want to. And you'll leave thinking it was pretty good but it will continue to run through your brain as you think about what a big deal this movie is for the LGBT community and that some day, it won't be. The movie could also serve as a PSA for all parents.","Love Simon",7616,3.8,-1.2

"7629",5,"  Wow! This is possibly one of my favorite movies ever. This movie took me up and down on an emotional rollercoaster, I cried, I laughed, I swooned. And it resonated with me on so many personal levels. The thing that hit me the hardest in this movie was the fact that I went through this exact same thing just a couple years ago, except for the blackmailing of course. I felt Simons highs and lows so deeply because they were and still are my highs and lows, his struggles are my struggles, his fears are my fears, because, yes, I'm gay. Never before have I felt like I could relate to a character as much as I do with Simon and that really made this move the experience of a lifetime for me. The fact that someone like me can be depicted in such a beautifully authentic, and painfully honest way in a blockbuster movie speaks volumes to how far we've come. Granted we still have lightyears to go. But, despite the fact that I am already out Simon's story inspired me so much that I want to do it again, I want to shout it from the rooftops, from the freaking mountaintops. I'M GAY! And I deserve a great love story just as much as Simon.","Love Simon",7629,3.8,-1.2
"7630",5,"  This movie is everything I wanted as a teen struggling to accept my sexuality and I couldn't be happier that the LGBT teens of today are getting to see themselves portrayed in a way no other movie has done before. call it what you want, but in all my years of going to the movies I have never seen an audience reaction this strong. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. Love, Simon is an instant classic, one I can see myself watching again and again, and has a protagonist that you will, in fact, love.","Love Simon",7630,3.8,-1.2

"7642",0.5,"  Folks, I'm a conservative Christian who really wanted to love this movie. But, please take it from me as the truth when I say this was an awful movie. One of the most boring films I have ever seen. I have not idea where all of these people who claim they loved it came from. So bad it was embarrassing to be there. Open the Book of Acts and begin reading it aloud while looking in the mirror.... now you have seen the movie. Gives other good Christian movies a black eye.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7642,2.8,2.3

"7650",5,"  Paul, Apostle of Chris is an outstanding film. Any true Christians seeking eternal life won't be walking out of theater doors with dry eyes. Atheists on this site predictably give the film low ratings as they will any Christian religious film and then try to disguise their biased comments with weak arguments. Also not a movie for those easily bored or impatient with dialogue and lack of action while being a superb movie for those attentive to actor's subtle dialogue and emotions. It is a well crafted fictional story of a believable possible way Paul and Luke lived through the end stage of Paul's life that is based on their faith on Jesus's most important message of salvation and eternal life. Watching the movie is often painful due to the ongoing horrors against Christians, but so is each of our personal struggles with reality we are mortal fleshly creatures that at the end of our lives possibly die into an eternal death without hope, losing everything we ever had, every experience and memory of our lives, losing everything and every one we ever loved. But in the end, the movie shows why those of us with faith have reason to persevere to the end with real hope.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7650,2.8,-2.2
"7651",0.5,"  Horrible, not scriptural, does not distinguish between Paul's Gospel and the Circumcision , it mixes gospels, it does not portray Paul's character and nature, and there are many unbiblical scenes...it's very dissapointing that Caviezel and the writers didn't study the scriptures more before making such an important movie... this movie will do more harm than good... Paul even warns that those who preach a different gospel is cursed. Also , Paul would NEVER recite the prayer "" Thy Kingdom come.."" because Paul's future is in the celestials... not on earth with Israel..Christians need to learn to correctly proportion scripture and study to show thyself approved..","Paul Apostle of Christ",7651,2.8,2.3

"7654",5,"  I saw ""Paul, Apostle of Christ"". I found it AMAZING. Although some of it is not in the Bible it is only meant for pacing. It didn't deviate whatsoever Biblically as far as I can tell. Will need read Acts and maybe some of Luke to be certain. The film is quite dark but there are moments of joy as it rightfully should be depicted. Although the commercials make it seem it is only Paul's last days there are flashbacks visually or through the actor (James Faulkner)who portrayed Paul. I have not seen this much attention to stay true to the Bible since ""The Passion of the Christ"".","Paul Apostle of Christ",7654,2.8,-2.2
"7655",4,"  Faith-based movies are making incredible strides. There is a great bit of good acting and solid cinematography in Paul, Apostle of Christ. The story does not develop as clearly and powerfully as it could have. The potential for Paul and the early Church's story is deep and wide, and little of it has been tapped in film as of yet. This Paul movie takes steps towards the greatness it could have been. With that said, as a lover of Christ and His word, I found myself in tears more than once as the film gave narrative context to some of the most powerful words uttered by human lips. This was especially true with the final, and greatest scene of the movie when Faulkner recites portions of 2 Timothy as he bears his neck to be slain for His master. What follows filled me up.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7655,2.8,-1.2
"7656",0.5,"  The story is rich enough to make it a masterpiece. But for that, an atheist should have make this movie... It would have resonated brilliantly into today America. Unfortunately, the people who made it where too scared and the movie is just annoying and empty...","Paul Apostle of Christ",7656,2.8,2.3
"7657",2,"  I had high hopes for this movie I was completely disappointed. This movie was a missed opportunity. They pick up the movie at the end of paul's life in prison in rome before his execution. they should have started the story when he was saul, a jewish Pharisee, his conversion, his preaching, travels etc. this movie depicts Christians as weak martyrs. James Faulkner is miscast for the role of paul as is Olivier martinez as Mauritius. he can barely speak a word of English. we needed subtitles just to understand him alone. they give the character of paul a condo for a prison cell, large, spacious, clean as a whistle lighted by torches and not a rat, snake or cockroach in sight. reality was that paul was kept in a prison cell where the sewage of rome ran through it and where he was forced to stand chained chest high in it with rats etc. swimming all around him. when mauriitius asks paul ""can your god heal my daughter"" paul's CONFUSED AND WEAK ANSWER IS ""I DON'T KNOW"" WELL, thank God for luke who comes in and saves the day. seriously? We need a movie showing the real power of our god, our savior and our gospel, not this.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7657,2.8,0.8
"7658",5,"  Amazing Movie! A must see for every Christian! ??????","Paul Apostle of Christ",7658,2.8,-2.2
"7659",1,"  This wasted Jim Caviezel's talents for me. I am putting Andrew Hyatt and Affirm Films in my own personal blacklist along with Disney and Whedon.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7659,2.8,1.8
"7660",5,"  Honestly, I was a little hesitant going into this, as a lot of Christian films tend to be cheesy, poorly-made, Scripturally and theologically flimsy/borderline heretical, etc. I could go on. However, the subject matter (Saint Paul) and the casting intrigued me enough to give it a shot. And I'm so happy I did.It's one of the best Christian films I have ever seen, and that's including the old Hollywood Biblical epics.This film gives a fair representation of the harsh reality of the lives of the early Christians. It's dramatic, but not overly so. It's blunt, yet gentle. It treats its characters with respect and heartfelt humanity. Most importantly, however, is the highest regard it shows to its inspiration, the Gospel message of Christ-the joyful hope and perseverance it gives, the transformative power it brings to hearts and lives, the truth and peace it gives in a chaotic world.The movie is called 'Paul, Apostle of Christ', and yet, the film isn't really ABOUT Paul. Which is why it's wonderful. Despite his great accomplishments, everything Paul did was not to bring glory or recognition to himself, but to Jesus. Despite being the greatest evangelist the Church will ever know, Paul considered himself unworthy of any boasting, except to boast in what Christ had done for him and the rest of the world.Saul/Paul had caused so much pain and suffering to the early followers of Jesus, and then he himself would come to know that same pain and suffering himself for Christ's sake. He knew death was not a loss or an end, but true life and gain.This movie is faithful to that message of God's great love. Go see it. A 43% critics score is absurdly hyper-critical, though, unsurprising.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7660,2.8,-2.2
"7661",0.5,"  I often forgot the movie was about Paul. It was extremely slow paced and a poor portrayal of Paul and Christians in the first century. The faith of the Christians were very contrary to what is written about in the Bible. The entire movie teased a healing miracle that never came. The parts of Paul's life included in the movie were unengaging. Overal: BORING MOVIE!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7661,2.8,2.3

"7665",5,"  I (a grown man who isn't accustomed to crying) was in tears at the happy ending. This is an extremely moving movie. Now officially one of my favorite movies.

Can't recommend this masterpiece enough!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7665,2.8,-2.2
"7666",4,"  Jim Caviezel and James Faulkner were excellent in their portrayal of Luke and Paul. The plot will be hard for some to really get into and its rather slow paced. I will say that most people in the theater stayed until the credits were over and everyone was silent. This movie is thought provoking for sure, it may also pull at you to learn more about your faith or even to become stronger in that faith. Give it a shot at matinee prices if you're unsure about it. Acting is phenomenal by all those in the film. Worth seeing.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7666,2.8,-1.2
"7667",5,"  Loved this movie. Great acting. Very moving and incredibly powerful. It has helped me understand Paul's letters and the Acts of the Apostles more clearly and has put voices to my Bible reading.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7667,2.8,-2.2

"7670",5,"  This is a great movie, understand this is not about the life of Paul, this is about our call to serve Jesus.... even when we are attacked for our beliefs and actions.May you find as much encouragement as I did, it brought home the life that those in other parts of the World live in today. I pray we never see it this bad in America! God bless","Paul Apostle of Christ",7670,2.8,-2.2
"7671",5,"  This movie was the best biblical movie I've seen since the Passion of the Christ. It is true that the world doesn't know a thing about Love as Luke points out in the movie. I believe that is why many people don't like the movie. But if you understand Agape, you will enjoy the movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7671,2.8,-2.2
"7672",5,"  It can be very difficult to make a biblical movie. There is a lot of pressure to creat a film that many would believe the source of the story to be fictional and produce a plausable narritive. This film exceeded my expectations. I really didn't know what to expect going into this film after recently viewing ""Samson,"" however, I was thankful I gave it a shot.The production of this film was above average. CGI was not overdone and the acting was inviting into simple biblical narritive that didn't overwhelm nor undercut the struggle of first century life for the believer in Jesus.I was pleased by the accuracy of the historical evidence we have and more over this story didn't attempt to make everything supernatural and mystical. It was encouraging to see the struggle of faith in Jesus as Christ was a challenge from the very beginning of the church.I'm no expert in movie reviews, but I wanted to say this film deserves a go for the person of faith. Again, this film offers a ""plausable"" account of the beginning life of the church. I don't think the message of the film is to convince you that this is what happened at the end of Pauls life. It is a fresh invitation to consider our life, our struggle and our message of the gospel of Jesus to the world we live in.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7672,2.8,-2.2
"7673",4.5,"  There are several narratives in this movie that correlate to today's life for believers: My faith sometimes falters because I've never seen Christ; Given the cruelty of world where is God? How should I confront death?A good movie. Will be liked by believers.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7673,2.8,-1.7
"7674",4.5,"  ""Paul"" is a good example of hoity-toity critics being divorced from the movie-going audience. A majority of critics gave it a low rating but the audience 89 percent. (Thank you Ann Hornaday of the Washington Postt for giving it a positive review. ) This is a fine, powerful movie, that is unforgettable. It is not for delicate souls. It takes place in the last weeks of St. Paul's life while he is imprisoned in Rome. Christians are in hiding, hunted down like animals. Should they flee Rome or stay? Their fellow Christians are herded into the Collisseum to be devoured by lions as entertainment for the Romans. Does ""turning the other cheek"" make any sense? Ideas like this are very hard to dramatize but this movie succeeds in doing it. It does not shy away from showing the harshness and cruelty of Nero's Rome but it also shows what faith can do. Too bad that today there are more fake and lukewarm Christians around (like the Trump lovers) than Paul's Christians. If you want to know what real Christianity is about see this fine movie","Paul Apostle of Christ",7674,2.8,-1.7
"7675",5,"  This depiction of Paul's life and sacrifice for the gospel will inspire others to ask a very important question.....what am I truly living for?","Paul Apostle of Christ",7675,2.8,-2.2

"7677",4,"  Not a perfect film but the interweaving of Biblical text as dialogue was seamless and natural. The humanity of the apostles was real. They were not perfect individuals but they had been changed by the Messiah and this was acted out naturally. Would have been tighter without the Cassius subplot but from a faith-based film perspective, this was a 10.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7677,2.8,-1.2

"7683",5,"  Excellent movie. Strong performances by James Faulkner and Jim Caviesel. Wonderful how the dialogue weaves in and out of Paul's words in Acts of the Apostles.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7683,2.8,-2.2
"7684",2.5,"  There are great actors in this movie. So why was the acting bad? Director. The story was in the realm of being long and tiring. Why is that? The writer. Some of the conversation uses common terms that take away from the classic language. Nice try.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7684,2.8,0.3

"7687",5,"  Well worth the viewing this weekend. Rich movie with a difficult subject but ultimately victorious ending. Will cause you to think and be grateful for the sacrifice of Paul and 1st century Christians for our Christian faith. This is an excellent encore for Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) back to Biblical movies. HINT: You will see him again soon in the Passion of the Christ Sequel! RECOMMEND.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7687,2.8,-2.2
"7688",4.5,"  the movie was amazing but I wish there was more gore","Paul Apostle of Christ",7688,2.8,-1.7
"7689",2.5,"  As a Catholic, I am a bit ashamed that I do not know enough about St. Paul and the Acts of the Apostle enough to review the movie based upon the original source material--the New Testament itself! However, I can access it based on its merit as a film, and it is, I think for the faithful Christian, recommended viewing.First, I merit the film based on the recent turgid, Hollywood, non-faithful/ ignorant-of-the-faith recent films with faith-based themes, like Ben Hur, Moses, Samson, and Noah--all made by major Hollywood studios and with well-known directors behind them. That they focused solely on mere spectacle divorced from its underlying and most important message of faith is astonishing. Maybe I can say that they all floundered in the box office precisely because of its agnostic message (if there was any) divorced from faith but I think that would be acceding to ignorance. They were just poorly made films, I think, and, divorced from its faith-message, no reason for the true devout Christian to see them.Any faithful believer and adherent of Christianity would recognize that rare movie made by well-intended, well-informed Christian. This film is one of them. (Not to keen on who the director of this film is, nor its writer, the faith message in this film is clearly felt if not clearly intended).So take heart Christians and heed-not the poor reviews that appear from non-Christians for, being ignorant of the faith, they cannot access what's truly important in this film, which is Saul's last attempt at the Good News during the last year of his persecution. It may not be wholly faithful to the Acts of the Apostle but I think God would forgive that and bless its good intentions nonetheless. Recommend viewing for the Christian and the overall general public.I give it two and a half stars for its merit strictly as a film and merits as a film medium including its production values, but to be true, I give it three stars for its success as a faith-based film, which I think merits a separate rating.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7689,2.8,0.3
"7690",5,"  This was a Great Movie!! I loved every minute of it. There needs to be more movies like this. Inspiring and great message. Must watch!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7690,2.8,-2.2
"7691",5,"  I went in with low expectations because of the critics ratings and was pleasantly surprised with the depth of this movie. Olivier Martinez's role as Mauritius was particularly engaging.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7691,2.8,-2.2
"7692",5,"  First, the great news. Hollywood made a movie about the Apostle Paul and featured a major TV star in the leading role.The production itself was first rate. The portrayal of the personalities of and relationship between Luke and Paul was intriguing and well considered. My guess is that Paul was indeed a bit of a curmudgeon, which is the way the actor chose to interpret him.The prominent role given to Priscilla and Aquila was enjoyable. These are two wonderful New Testament characters worthy of wider consideration.The reality of Paul's daily life in a dark, dank prison cell really hit home for me, as well as the reality of how his body must have been absolutely wracked with constant pain from years of abuse. Deeply moving and very humbling.I was disappointed by the extended focus on a fictional sub-plot that added nothing to the film when the Book of Acts is filled with so much fascinating material that could have been brought to life.I heard the movie was filled with flashbacks and had assumed they would flesh out some of his missionary journeys. They did not. I also would have liked to see more of Ancient Rome than two houses and a prison cell - although these three scenes certainly provide a glimpse onto the pages of the New Testament.Finally, I thought the portrayal of the 1st Century church as impotent and befuddled was inaccurate. They turned the entire Roman Empire upside down. And they certainly couldn't have done that hunkered down in a state of perpetual fear and confusion.Nevertheless, the film accomplishes much and we should rejoice in that. In just about two weeks, I will be co-leading a biblical tour ""In the Footsteps of Paul"" and we will be visiting the prison featured in the film. It promises to be a very powerful experience...and even more powerful having so recently seen the film.Let's pray for Hollywood to produce more faith-affirming films in the days to come.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7692,2.8,-2.2
"7693",2.5,"  The movie is well made, beautifully photographed, well acted. I think the consensus critique above is accurate - simply not enough of Paul's story, which was the reason I went to see it.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7693,2.8,0.3
"7694",5,"  A beautiful story of forgiveness and redemption even fir a persecution. Going to see it again!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7694,2.8,-2.2
"7695",5,"  Biblically sound in regards to doctrine, aligns with history and scripture, and tells the truth of what really happened. Nothing extra and nothing that lacked. Im glad the film makers stuck with telling the truth compared to your typical standard of hollywood entertainment. Very surprised to see the ratings given by critics, deserves way more credit than this. We need more films such as these. Big thumbs up.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7695,2.8,-2.2
"7696",5,"  Saw this movie last weekend and it was truly inspiring","Paul Apostle of Christ",7696,2.8,-2.2
"7697",5,"  This is not your average adventure thriller. It is deeply meaningful and bound to be misunderstood by the person with little interest in the values of Christianity. It is artistically and visually well done. The critic above obviously does not even understand that this is not a story taken from Bible. It is written from the point of view of background on what may have been happening as the book of Acts was being written. It demonstrates what was happening historically at the time. I give the movie an A+ in its genre of Christian-themed film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7697,2.8,-2.2
"7698",5,"  Gave me something to think about... I liked the line ""peace begins with you.""","Paul Apostle of Christ",7698,2.8,-2.2
"7699",4,"  Solid performances and cinematography. Not the typical cliche approach to a faith based theme. Portrays authentic spiritual struggle of those who wrestle between faith and doubt.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7699,2.8,-1.2
"7700",5,"  AUDIENCE SCORE says it all.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7700,2.8,-2.2
"7701",5,"  I found this to be a very powerful movie! The cruelty of Nero""s Rome towards the early Christians and what they had to endure was incredible. The actors that played Paul and Luke were terrific!!!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7701,2.8,-2.2
"7702",5,"  This movie was both challenging and amazing!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7702,2.8,-2.2
"7703",5,"  We ventured out to see the movie Paul, the Apostle of Christ with much eagerness and anticipation.The movie is based upon the timeline and scripture of 1st and 2nd Timothy where Paul (James Fulkner) is imprisoned in Rome, already tried for treason, and is waiting for his death sentence to be carried out.The church in Rome is under severe persecution and faces a choice to flee or stay. The church sends Luke (Jim Caviezel) to seek out Paul's guidance in his final moments. While seeking out guidance Luke is also on mission to capture Paul's final thoughts of wisdom.This film is most certainly not for the faint of heart for it truthfully depicts the real life situations of the roman persecution and torture of Christians. There are some graphic scenes suited for a mature audience.The overall central theme of the movie is that love overcomes all situations and is the inspiration of every choice and action a believer should make.It echo's the central message of 1 Corinthians 13, the over flowing grace of Jesus, and includes some of Paul's most defining moments and testimony including his trip to Damascus.Every believer will face various trials and difficulties and although it isn't always clear which road to take it is clear how we should treat one another.The movie inspires the idea of who we are meant to be as Christians and what we were meant to do as the church. This movie will inspire you to appreciate the gospel message that was preserved through the persecution of the apostles and strive to reach further its purpose and meaning in the kingdom.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7703,2.8,-2.2
"7704",5,"  Seems like many of the critics were expecting a different movie entirely. This is a story of the early church clinging to faith in the face of persecution, while Paul, at the end of his life, grapples with forgiveness. I found it to be quite dramatic throughout, and for me personally it was an intensely emotional experience.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7704,2.8,-2.2
"7705",5,"  Enjoyed very much, good portrayal of Paul","Paul Apostle of Christ",7705,2.8,-2.2
"7706",4,"  Great, great acting. Kind of slow. But super informative. I learned so much.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7706,2.8,-1.2
"7707",1,"  There is a treasure trove of great stories about Paul already provided for us in the book of Acts. Why didn't they try to tell us THOSE stories? Instead, we get a rather boring extra-biblical story that makes Luke look like a non-eyewitness.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7707,2.8,1.8
"7708",5,"  The film speaks to everyone...maybe not to critics. Well done and well performed by ALL the actors!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7708,2.8,-2.2
"7709",5,"  Here is what I think on the new movie, Paul, the apostle of Christ. It is like a beautiful meditation over the purest Christian core values without any pietistic attitude. A film, what I was waiting for. It shows the divine and the human in an excellent mixture. One of my favourite scene when Luke, the physician save the Roman's daughter's life with his medical knowledge (instead of healing her in miraculous way, which wa common that time). Brave art movie, showing those christian saints like humans and at the same time help to understand better the unimaginable Divine Mercy. Prepare space in your heart if you plan to watch! And I was just wondering, those critics, whom did't find enough action in the movie: what would they do with.. hmm for example northern europian art movies, or even Stalker ;)","Paul Apostle of Christ",7709,2.8,-2.2
"7710",5,"  Amazing movie! That is just a little bit that our brothers and sisters went through at that time.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7710,2.8,-2.2
"7711",5,"  Great movie, captured a lot that was happening in time period you don't hear about. Next to Acts visual Bible this is the best movie about Paul I've seen.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7711,2.8,-2.2

"7715",5,"  Good movie. This movie made me want to learn more about Paul. Plus, I love how this movie shows the relationship between a Christian couple.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7715,2.8,-2.2
"7716",5,"  As a believer and follower of Jesus Christ myself, this film gives a truth and realism how Paul came to the love of Christ and wanting to serve his Lord even through the trails he faces as a Christian. If you are a Christian I highly recommend this film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7716,2.8,-2.2
"7717",5,"  The best movie about the Bible I've ever seen. I liked it even better than the Passion. Highly recommended.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7717,2.8,-2.2

"7720",5,"  The critics are so utterly predictable. This movie is powerful and uplifting!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7720,2.8,-2.2
"7721",3,"  Grade: BRating: PG-13, 108 minutesIn a Nutshell: Just in time for the Easter season, this Christian movie brings Paul and Luke, both faithful followers of Jesus Christ, to the big screen with their unique friendship and affirming messages.This film is VERY heavy, dark, gory, and even depressing. In that regard, it's very realistic. The film states at the end that is has been ""dedicated to all those who have been persecuted for their faith."" Christians will leave with a feeling of reverence and increased respect for the early Christians.While this movie really won't convince non-believers to turn their lives over to Christ, it is another arrow in the quiver of recent Christian movies that build faith and testimony. Christian movies are slowly getting better and I'm grateful that Christian audiences support them in movie theaters.Two additional Christian movies, a holy trinity of films so to speak, are also in theaters at the same time to celebrate the Easter season: I Can Only Imagine DVD and God's Not Dead: A Light In Darkness (Songs From And Inspired By The Motion Picture).Tips for parents: There are a lot of gruesome images of torture, deaths, bodies burning, and suffering. I'm almost surprised that this movie wasn't rated R because of so many brutal scenes.There is a LOT of talking with not very much action. Most children will be bored. It's definitely not a feel-good popcorn movie for a fun Friday night. It is, however, a thought-provoking film that will make you think and feel.Uplifting theme: Enduring faithForgivenessBe the light.Peace begins with you.""Love is the only way."" - Luke""We cannot repay evil with evil. Evil can only be overcome with good."" - Paul""Men do not die for things they doubt."" - Paul""We live for the Lord. We die for the Lord. Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord."" - PaulThrough suffering, good can come.Things I liked:I really like Jim Caviezel. Knowing that he is a solid Christian makes me like him even more, especially as he tries to lend his big star name and talent to Christian movies, which are often seen as amateur and cheesy. Jim Caviezel gave impressive strength to Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ Do you want to know what he did with a lot of the money he earned from that movie? He adopted 3 special needs children. Wow.I like the Giving Films logo and the name ""Affirm Films.""The production value was very high. Good technical work.I thought the Lord's Prayer scene was powerful.The end was very sweet.Filming was done in Malta, where Paul actually went on one of his journeys.Some humor.Some of the dialogue was full of rich wisdom.I really like it when movie theaters don't instantly raise the lights when a movie ends. Audiences are able to sit and reflect for a few minutes and even compose themselves before the lights turn back on.I really liked the scene where Luke told Paul that he saw Jesus in him when Paul taught the gospel. What a great compliment. Oh that people could see Christ in us!Things I didn't like:There are a LOT of scenes in dark corners and dungeons, making it hard to see what's going on. There are also a lot of scenes with whispered conversations, making it hard to hear what's being said.The various accents were distracting. Characters spoke with British accents, French, American, and even one guy sounded Scottish. Paul's famous ""Road to Damascus"" scene was surprisingly short. I wanted more.Some of the flashbacks could have been done better. It seemed like they were reusing footage to save money.It drags in some places, especially during the first half. My sister and I both got drowsy and had to keep each other awake. That's not good!Funny lines:""Come, eat. You must be starving."" - Aquilla (John Lynch)""If you're cooking, I don't know if I'm that hungry."" - Luke (Jim Caviezel)""Quit your complaining."" - Luke to Paul""They truly were miserable days with you. I do miss them."" - Paul to Luke Interesting lines:""The Devil sneaks in the darkness here."" - Paul (James Faulkner)""All men are a slave to something."" - Paul""Where sin abounds, grace abounds more."" - Paul""In a moment, you will know you know God's love and I hope it is soon."" - Paul""They will know us for our love."" - PaulIn an online interview with Jim Cazievel, he mentioned how he could watch good Christian movies like Ben Hur over and over. Be sure to watch that movie again this Easter season. It's old, but it's extremely powerful!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7721,2.8,-0.2
"7722",5,"  Great family movie. Enjoyed the story line - although not found in the scriptures, it was an interesting imaginative story.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7722,2.8,-2.2
"7723",2.5,"  I thought it was so-so. Gave some visibility to the persecution that Christians experienced in Rome during the time of Nero, but I didn't find the story very interesting.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7723,2.8,0.3
"7724",5,"  I enjoyed the movie. Really made me think about what life was like for the Christians back then. Very moving and outstanding portrayal of Paul & Luke.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7724,2.8,-2.2
"7725",2,"  I was hoping for a historical account. This is purely fabricated.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7725,2.8,0.8
"7726",4,"  I enjoyed this movie. James Faulkner was a good Paul and Jim C. was the pivotal character. It showed some of what Christians living under Nero faced - being used as human torches and having to make difficult decisions. The daughter being healed by Luke was a little too obvious but it made you think about how much the early Christians suffered as we sit in our reclining seats eating popcorn.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7726,2.8,-1.2
"7727",5,"  A wonderful presentation of the struggles faced by Christians. I have heard many say it should have been called ""Luke"" but I disagree strongly. This movie focused on Paul, his writings, his message, his struggles. Luke played a supporting role bridging the gap between Paul in the Roman prison and the Christians imprisoned in their hideaway in Rome. The emotional struggles and hardships endured for the faith of both were handled realistically. Acting was excellent and believable. The ending was especially moving.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7727,2.8,-2.2
"7728",4.5,"  As a pastor with a ThD in early church history, it was wonderful to see the history of the early church come to lif ron the screen. As a follower of Jesus Christ, it was heart wrenching to watch that history play out, also knowing the persecution that exist for Christian today in many countries. The Biblical themes of love overcoming evil and evil being overcome with good were found throughout. For the sceptic, one key aspect of Christianity still holds true: ""Men do not die for things they doubt."" I walked away with one question: Am I worthy to light the streets of Rome?","Paul Apostle of Christ",7728,2.8,-1.7
"7729",4,"  Watched it...first movie I PAID to see in over a year...well worth it... the LIBERAL movie reviewers are DUMBER than DOG SHIT for not liking this movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7729,2.8,-1.2

"7734",5,"  This is an amazing movie, and is so consistent with the events as presented in the Holy Bible. Very surprising for a movie from Hollywood. To really appreciate it you must know something about St. Paul and St. Luke. I give it 98%.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7734,2.8,-2.2
"7735",5,"  Loved it, worth to watch","Paul Apostle of Christ",7735,2.8,-2.2
"7736",5,"  I just watched Paul, Apostle of Christ.It was an excellent movie. As a Christian, it was deeply moving to me and there were several times I was in tears. Especially when Luke healed the centurion's daughter, it felt like a miracle.People of faith will have there faith strengthened by this movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7736,2.8,-2.2
"7737",5,"  This is a love story about showing the Love of Jesus. It felt more personal. I liked it very much.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7737,2.8,-2.2
"7738",3,"  it could have been exciting--all the things that happened to Paul--blinding, shipwreck, jail time. but the screen writers chose to do a movie about the last year of his life. Any exciting parts (not just him talking) were done as slo-mo flash backs. Children will not like, kinda boring. Good story, just boringly told. It will not be a keeper. no reason to watch it twice. even once, just reading the book of Acts is way more exciting than this movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7738,2.8,-0.2
"7739",5,"  It is an amazing privilage to understand the contents of this movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7739,2.8,-2.2
"7740",5,"  Brilliantly performed, wounderfully adapted and produced. This movie is a must see. With so many of the movies being produced today lacking real dialogue and meaningful messages, Paul, Apostle of Christ stands out as a testament to powerful magnetic performances with life impacting messages. Jim Cavesiel, one of the best under rated actors of our time, masterfully accounts for Paul's last days as documented and witnessed in his portrayal of Luke. This movie does not require a knowledge of scripture to be enjoyed. It's also rather disappointing that the critics who view Christianity as a threat to secular liberalism feel like it's their duty to attack this movie. Look at the audience ratings or better yet, go see the film and judge for yourself.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7740,2.8,-2.2
"7741",5,"  great movie-did not want to see it but wife wanted too. glad we went great acting and would see it again","Paul Apostle of Christ",7741,2.8,-2.2
"7742",5,"  Our culture needed a movie like this. I loved it. It reminded me of how much we can impact others through love, just like Paul and Luke were doing. This movie included the negativity Paul received because of his spreading of Christianity, and to know how much Christianity spread all around the world from these simple 12 apostles is very empowering to me as a Christian. It shows what was going on in Rome, what Paul really did. Whether one accepts or enjoys the truth is up to them, but the film is shown to depict what really happened, not what our society wants to see.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7742,2.8,-2.2
"7743",4,"  I loved how the film makers were able to portray the love of the early church without making the individual Christians seem less than fully human. It helps me to understand why and how so few became so many.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7743,2.8,-1.2
"7744",3.5,"  Moments of brilliance, but I would have liked more focus on Paul himself. Many scenes seemed dark and underlit; whispering in many scenes, while plausible given the setting, nevertheless sucked the energy out of portions. Overall, it was intelligent and faithful to the characters and delivered some emotional and spiritual punch. I felt it was good but could have been much better with tighter editing, more of Paul's life outside of prison and better lighting / sound editing. I'd recommend it to friends.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7744,2.8,-0.7
"7745",5,"  a great movie, the bible deserved it.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7745,2.8,-2.2
"7746",4,"  It was moving and heart wrenching at times. It did not have the same impact on me as ""Passion of the Christ"" but it was still good.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7746,2.8,-1.2
"7747",4,"  Great movie very accurate","Paul Apostle of Christ",7747,2.8,-1.2
"7748",5,"  Very rarely does a movie come along that I make an appeal for people to see (sadly, particularly a ""Christian"" movie). As a pastor, I like movies, so I see many of them, enjoy many of them, and I like talking to people about them, but I don't often appeal for people to please go watch a particular movie.Yesterday, I went to see ""Paul, Apostle of Christ."" It was simply fantastic. It personalized Paul and Luke in beautiful ways. Sure, they took a few liberties with characters and timelines. I can work with that. What really mattered was how they portrayed one of the most important men in history. They nailed it.I believe Larry the cucumber expressed it best when he said, ""I laughed. I cried. It moved me, Bob."" Whether you consider yourself a Christian or not, go see this movie. This week. Seriously.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7748,2.8,-2.2
"7749",4.5,"  Contrary to most of the professional critics, who's politics and genre biased egoes have entered their critiques. I.e. Inkoo Kang (""Naturally, no sticking points about Paul's legacy, like his (disputed) rejection of female church leaders.."") I found this to be a very good movie with very good acting and leaving movie goers with mostly historically based truisms and leaving a good moral backing at the end of the movie, regardless of what is someones religious affiliation. Apparently, this movie is as true today as is depicted in the movie. Only at this juncture in time Christians are not yet being murdered, yet being belittled and besmirched because of ones faith. I guess that is why you see an audience score of 90% verses a 35% on the tomatometer. Silly critics once again you miss the point and try to make yourself better than others.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7749,2.8,-1.7
"7750",5,"  The Audiences got this right , the critics got it wrong. A movie full of tears and passion if you know truly what's at stake during these times in Rome.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7750,2.8,-2.2
"7751",5,"  As I reflect on what I felt about this movie I am filled with Joy on so many levels. The art of this movie brought the time period to life and put me in the time and place the earliest Christians experienced. They were just beginning to grow in Faith and sacrificed so much. Bringing the words of the Bible to life is extremely personal for me since that is what I try to do in my devotions. This movie made me think in ways I never had about the life of Paul. Go see this movie! I pray this movie will touch all that see it and bring them to a deeper, personal relationship with God.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7751,2.8,-2.2
"7752",5,"  I'm a Christian in ministry, so call me biased. But I generally do not like Christian movies nor do I recommend them, so call me unbiased. I was moved to uncontrollable tears by the end of this movie. I recommend it to all believers, especially those sincerely involved in ministry.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7752,2.8,-2.2
"7753",5,"  This movie was executed on a cinematic level with The Passion of the Christ. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Love wins in the end, as it always does.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7753,2.8,-2.2
"7754",4,"  Pros: Very moving and inspirational. Good acting, with average production quality. Thought provoking and immersive character development for those who have a base of biblical knowledge. Cons: Slow pace, too much use of slow motion, not easily accessible for seekers or those with little biblical knowledge.Overall: an inspirational and encouraging must-see for Christians and perfect for showing to small groups or Sunday School classes.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7754,2.8,-1.2
"7755",5,"  Well done. It helped me see Paul in a new perspective.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7755,2.8,-2.2
"7756",5,"  Great movie! Just remember it is a story based true events, not an exact replica. All members of the Sanhedrin probably won't like it. Christ is the center and that is all that matters!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7756,2.8,-2.2
"7757",5,"  I've been bible thumping for 35 years. The movie is excellent!!!; everyone should see it; there are some nitpickers who will attack any Christian movie; I think a lot of those who attack this movie are nothing but atheist trolls who hate anything Christian. If you are a Christian or don't hate Christians, then this is the movie to see. Don't listen to Pharisees who will find some iota in the movie that they say isn't 100% biblically accurate. The movie is the best Christian movie of 2018, and for the last 10 years for that matter.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7757,2.8,-2.2

"7760",2,"  The movie trying to tell Paul's story from the point of view of Luke. However, lacking of the showing how Paul's life change after accepting Jesus the whole movie is slipping to ""Luke, the brave, loyalty travel partner of Paul. ""The costume and acting are detailed. I was touched when Luke saw someone he knew was burn on the post the struggle in his eyes and the teardrop.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7760,2.8,0.8
"7761",5,"  I m not religious and sometimes the acting was not great but. There is always a but. Good solid movie Sadly no sex no ar 15s. Sarcasm here. And not a sequel","Paul Apostle of Christ",7761,2.8,-2.2
"7762",5,"  One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7762,2.8,-2.2
"7763",5,"  I saw Paul: Apostle of Christ today. It is excellent. It is very accurate historically and biblically. It also gives time for contemplation, prayer, and meditation. I highly recommend it.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7763,2.8,-2.2
"7764",5,"  Outstanding!!!! Moving story and message! The theater I went to was sold out for this show! I will be seeing this movie again and will buy the DVD! James Caviecy is a truly gifted actor! Do yourself a favor and see this movie!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7764,2.8,-2.2
"7765",5,"  This movie was very deep. Each character presented a human perspective in front of a human question. So often religious movies glaze over the flashiness of the Christian faith. But, we are human, and we both struggle with and recognize reality.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7765,2.8,-2.2

"7768",2.5,"  A well-meaning mess. The acting and production values were so good that I still found the ending emotionally affecting, but the script and direction completely muffed the story-telling. Pauls story is actually a very exciting one, but unless you know it, you will barely understand how it is told here. Sad.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7768,2.8,0.3
"7769",5,"  Powerful, moving. I highly recommend it. It is difficult to watch at times but very realistic, Rome under emperor Nero was a time of tribulation.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7769,2.8,-2.2
"7770",5,"  Fabulous film! The film assumes it is playing to a somewhat biblically-educated audience, which is understandable given the theme. However, even someone living under a rock all their life would find the film enlightening. The lighting, the lack of gruesome details, the dialogue all pull this film together to make a memorable experience for the audience. I'll probably go again, and I will certainly buy the dvd when it comes out.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7770,2.8,-2.2
"7771",5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was very inspiring!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7771,2.8,-2.2
"7772",5,"  Dont listen to the critics. This was an amazingly acted and delivered film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7772,2.8,-2.2
"7773",5,"  Powerful portrayal of the Apostle Paul's struggles and wrestlings with spreading the Gospel of Christ to the Roman Empire. James Faulkner delivered such a riveting performance that during his monologues, there was utter silience in the theatre with the feeling the viewers didn't want to miss a single word of his performance. Jim Caviezel's role as Luke was true to the insight he gained in his role of The Passion of Christ. His fervor to get Paul's words recorded and spread among the believers was palpable and teleported me into the Roman prison cell with them. I think the best possible review is in knowing that not one dry eye left the theatre after watching this film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7773,2.8,-2.2
"7774",5,"  Absolutely amazing movie, incredible acting and ... Hollywood please take note -- it is a true and inspiring story of love! As someone who has read and reread the Bible, this is a wonderful big screen adaptation of an exciting adventure about Paul (Saul of Tarsus) and Luke (writer of a few New Testament books). For those who are more intrigued by super heroes, special effects and sequels, you may have a hard time. For those of you who enjoy greta acting, appreciate intelligent dialogue, theology or history - you'll love it!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7774,2.8,-2.2
"7775",4.5,"  Story of Paul as seen through Luke. This movie touched my Soul, to have such Faith in the darkest of times to truly know that your are going to be with the Lord if you accept Jesus and know that death is but an instant and eternal life is there just for the asking.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7775,2.8,-1.7
"7776",5,"  Great movie. Critics are completely out of touch with audiences.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7776,2.8,-2.2
"7777",5,"  Sheila, Deborah and I walked away from that movie learning ""Love"" is all that matters. The movie was excellent. Every scripture took me back to bible. I walked away from the movie with revelation and knowledge. Thank you for enlightening my understanding to the book of Acts. As we exited the movie, there were 2 other ladies standing outside. We all had shed tears, and we understood that we were all from different races, cultures and background. We all felt the LOVE that was express throughout the movie. Well done!!!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7777,2.8,-2.2
"7778",5,"  Reading Biblical and non-Biblical historical sources I've often wondered what it must have been like to know the Apostles; to observe their personalities and interactions first hand. This movie places you in the room with them. Authenic to the period and Scripture with excellent cinematography; it's a well crafted movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7778,2.8,-2.2
"7779",5,"  This movie makes me want to dive right into an extensive study of The Acts of The Apostles and beyond. Mr. Caviezel andMr. Faulkner were brilliant as St. Luke and St. Paul. The entire cast was wonderful (I need to read more about Aquila and Priscilla now)Thank you so much for bringing their story to the screen!!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7779,2.8,-2.2
"7780",5,"  Beautiful movie! James Faulkner is brilliant in his portrayal of Saint Paul! And, Jim Caviezel gives an equally powerful, inspired performance as Saint Luke! I'm inspired to read the Letters of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles from beginning to end thanks to this lovely and Biblically grounded tribute to Christ and His Love which conquers all!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7780,2.8,-2.2
"7781",5,"  Powerful account of Paul's imprisonment, Luke's documentation of Paul's conversion and teachings and Christian's life in Rome during these times.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7781,2.8,-2.2
"7782",5,"  An excellent film. If you're looking for word for word biblical recreation, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you're hope is to be inspired, by a film that dramatizes the early church, and glorifies God - I don't think you'll be disappointed. Well done.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7782,2.8,-2.2
"7783",5,"  I loved this movie. A beautiful and harsh reminder that we should never take our faith for granted. Love and compassion are far more powerful than hate and vengeance. I also enjoyed the bits of humor between Luke and Paul","Paul Apostle of Christ",7783,2.8,-2.2
"7784",5,"  Great biblically based book. Very emotional. Excellent. Highly recommend.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7784,2.8,-2.2
"7785",5,"  One of the best movies 2018 has to offer","Paul Apostle of Christ",7785,2.8,-2.2
"7786",5,"  I really enjoyed this movie. Obviously some liberties have to be taken since we don't know all that happened during the persecution of the church in Rome and right before Paul's death. But the movie is solid in scripture. I felt they depicted Paul well. Luke was awesome. People forget when reading scripture that Paul and all the disciples were real people with real emotions. Paul had to wrestle through all the things we do in our hearts. He had a past that he had to surrender to Jesus. I like his vulnerability. The love we are to live with is demonstrated great. The persecution and the challenge that it poses was clearly portrayed. I would recommend this movie to any Christian and anyone seeking truth. And let this prepare you for what could easily take place in the US. Our brothers and sisters are already suffering all over the world.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7786,2.8,-2.2
"7787",5,"  I saw the movie Friday night and it was amazing and powerful. Was so glad to see it was Biblically accurate. This movie will touch a lot of people, my prayer is the Holy Spirit will move and see people come to Christ.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7787,2.8,-2.2
"7788",5,"  The encouragement that this movie brought to us is life changing! Very blessed to watch this movie here in the Philippines! We have nothing but gratitude to everyone who made this possible. THANK YOU! I will definitely tell my fellow Christians to watch this movie! To Him be all the glory!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7788,2.8,-2.2
"7789",0.5,"  Religious junk. Only crazy Christians would find this a good film. Boring, badly done, bad acting and a stupid story. Rleligious fantasy stories for the stupid.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7789,2.8,2.3
"7790",5,"  This is a great family movie, my teenage boys all got a lot out of it. The message that Jesus teaches us about loving our enemies was clearly portrayed. I highly recommend the film and support it opening weekend if possible.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7790,2.8,-2.2

"7793",5,"  This movie is stunning not just for the historical perspective but also for the implications of Christian faith today. The love that theseChristians showed in the midst of true evil must be the love that Christians show today.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7793,2.8,-2.2
"7794",0.5,"  A new faith-based, unnecessary movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7794,2.8,2.3
"7795",2.5,"  ""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" (PG-13, 1:47) is a biblical drama directed and co-written by Andrew Hyatt (""Full of Grace"", ""The Last Light"", ""The Frozen""), featuring an international cast which includes experienced actors from both film and television. The plot centers around the writing of the biblical book of Acts.The film opens with Jim Caviezel (who famously played Jesus in 2004's ""The Passion of the Christ""), as the apostle Luke, arriving in Rome as the Christian believers in the capital are suffering constant persecution under Emperor Nero - and the apostle Paul (James Faulkner) sits in prison awaiting his execution as an enemy of the empire. After conferring with Aquilla (John Lynch) and Priscilla (Joanne Whaley), the leaders of one Christian community in hiding, and tending to the medical needs of their people, Luke visits Paul. Aided by a prison guard, Luke starts paying regular visits under cover of night.Luke convinces Paul that the world needs the encouragement of hearing his story and Paul starts dictating what would later become known in the Bible as the Acts of the Apostles. This allows for brief flashbacks showing the journey of Saul of Tarsus (played by Yorgos Karamihos) from merciless persecutor of Christians to the loving, faithful imprisoned leader of the church. We also get to hear conversations between the two church fathers about the past, present and future of their faith. Even though a man named Mauritius (Olivier Martinez), the Roman officer in charge of the prison, learns of Luke's visits, he allows them to continue because he sees no harm in any of it - and he is intrigued by Paul and Luke, even as he prays and sacrifices to the Roman gods for the life of his sick daughter. As Luke continues to visit Paul, Aquilla and Priscilla struggle to keep their community together and safe in the face of the threat of violence (ranging from being beaten by Roman soldiers to literally being thrown to the lions) and internal disagreements about whether to stay in Rome or flee - and whether to answer Nero's persecution with the love Jesus preached or the more practical response of violence.""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" is an interesting and high-quality, but often dull portrayal of a pivotal period in early church history. In spite of the film's title, the amount of screen time devoted to Paul makes him little more than a supporting player in his own story. The script excels at character development, but contains little action, in spite of the abundance of drama which we know existed at this time and place. As ""talky"" as this film is, however, the performances are solid across the board - and particularly outstanding from the main actors - while the production values throughout the film are very high. Of course, we can legitimately question the historicity of the developments portrayed given that the filmmakers relied solely on biblical accounts, without the benefit of more objective histories. This film's strengths are its acting and its technical achievements. ""B-""","Paul Apostle of Christ",7795,2.8,0.3

"7802",5,"  I thought it was a great movie.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7802,2.8,-2.2
"7803",5,"  Outstanding portrayal of Paul and Luke. Piercing footage of the persecution in Rome at the time, of Christians. So worth the watch. There are thoughtful conversations that are longer in the middle of the movie; some may think them too long. The stories of individuals are woven throughout very effectively. Very, very moving, with a lot of believable suspense and drama.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7803,2.8,-2.2

"7806",5,"  Incredible is an understatement! The story line was so compelling and definitely put you right there with what life was like 2,000 years ago for St.Paul & Luke! Makes you feel so thankful for the gift of the Catholic Faith and for all those who were and are still persecuted for the Faith. This is a MUST SEE, especially before Easter! Deo Gratias!!!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7806,2.8,-2.2
"7807",5,"  Good Christian content that honored the Risen Christ ad his early disciples,","Paul Apostle of Christ",7807,2.8,-2.2
"7808",5,"  This is an important film. It is the Bible come to life, accurately, and brutally. It speaks of hope, love, redemption, grace, and godliness. In Paul's writings, he paints a clear portrait of a Christ-follower and constantly reminds us why we do what we do. Jim Caviezel is brilliant as Luke, and it's hard not to see him as the Jesus he portrayed in ""The Passion of the Christ"". This actually works, because it is a subtle reminder of the unseen center of the story...Jesus. James Faulkner is exactly who you picture as Paul. His portrayal was spot on. The Bible does not address the end of Paul's life, but history does. This movie tells ""the rest of the story"" and in doing so, answers the persistent question ""if God loves you, why does He let you suffer?"". Read Luke and Acts to learn more. I encourage everyone to go see it to support a good film ...and to stir your soul.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7808,2.8,-2.2
"7809",5,"  Well Done, Touching, brought tears to my eyes. Suggest all christian see it.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7809,2.8,-2.2

"7813",5,"  AWESOME..a must see movie!","Paul Apostle of Christ",7813,2.8,-2.2
"7814",5,"  Inspirational portrayal of Pauls last days in prison. A little slow in some places, but the ending makes up for any lag in the plot.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7814,2.8,-2.2
"7815",3.5,"  This is not your cup of tea if all you know about Christianity is a graphic of Christ with a lamb over his shoulders. If you have read Paul's letters, Luke's gospel and the Book of Acts, then this film will speak to you in a positive way. To the uniformed it's a lot of speaking that comes across as boring gibberish, and it's action that has no context. If you have a personal relationship with Jesus, this film will be a spiritual buffet. Professional acting and effective cinematography.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7815,2.8,-0.7
"7816",5,"  Great movie!!! Highly recommended.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7816,2.8,-2.2
"7817",5,"  I saw this movie today and thought it was great. I'm not a scripture expert, but the story of Saul/Paul is very compelling in that everyone can be forgiven and loved by Jesus.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7817,2.8,-2.2
"7818",5,"  Very good movie!!! Highly recommend seeing it.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7818,2.8,-2.2
"7819",3,"  A bit slow paced, and I was hoping for a more in depth reflection on Paul's life as Saul and his conversion. Honestly I believe a life like Paul's needs to be approached with a grittier director that is willing to show the honesty and ugliness along with the contrast of the beauty of life. Paul's life was filled with great darkness and intense light. I believe this was a missed opportunity.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7819,2.8,-0.2
"7820",5,"  I really enjoyed this film. The production value was quite high and the storytelling was solid. The dynamic between the three male figures was really well done and conveyed very nicely, the different stages these men were in their faiths. There was not as much action as the trailer implied and I enjoyed that, as there were several quiet moments where the story was able to be more subtle and I appreciated that spacious feel that those moments were given, There was also a lovely addition of some gallows humor between Paul and Luke that I really loved. In the end I cried and was left filled with awe at the sacrifice the early Christians were forced to endure for their faith. I would highly recommend this film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7820,2.8,-2.2
"7821",5,"  St. Luke's account of the persecution and ultimate triumph of St. Paul is a deeply personal tribute. The Acts of the Apostles are referenced, as are the contributions of Aquila and Priscilla. It is a spiritually envigorating retelling, well worth the experience.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7821,2.8,-2.2
"7822",5,"  Truly inspirational story. Really humanized the early Christians and their persecution and unwavering faith.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7822,2.8,-2.2
"7823",1,"  Movie review ""Paul, Apostle of Christ""Two thumbs down ????I had high expectations and I have One word to describe this film - AWFULI find this movie Faithless and Hopeless. Presenting a powerless gospel with a portrayal of Paul and Luke as carnal Christians. I believe the true purpose behind this film was to present a view that the gospel is of no effect. A film that will leave the audience feeling that Christianity is just another religion, that you can ""take it or leave it"".","Paul Apostle of Christ",7823,2.8,1.8
"7824",5,"  Well written movie with a steady and constant build right up to the end! Masterfully portrayal of the persecution and danger facing the early church and how following Christ is not easy.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7824,2.8,-2.2

"7827",5,"  im curious how good it will be","Paul Apostle of Christ",7827,2.8,-2.2
"7828",5,"  Saw it at Texas Station in Las Vegad. It was one of the best movies I have seen in years. I almost didn't go because of the low Tomatometer score but I am so glad I did. Such a difference between their rating and how much I enjoyed the film is hard to believe.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7828,2.8,-2.2
"7829",1.5,"  As a catholic, there are no problems or issues with the story elements and plot details since it was based on the story of the Bible but how it flaws is the depicting and storytelling of the story and also the inaccurate script and writing of the characters. It's lacking the characters' purpose and roles to the film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7829,2.8,1.3
"7830",5,"  Great portrayal of Paul and Luke in their latter years of ministry. Oliver Martinez also was outstanding in his role as procurator. The message of Jesus Christ is beautifully shared.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7830,2.8,-2.2
"7831",5,"  I liked it..not cheesy","Paul Apostle of Christ",7831,2.8,-2.2
"7832",3,"  Look, I'm a Christian, and I just watched the film. I was excited to see it especially after hearing Jim Caviezel talk at SLS2018. Despite this, I could not help being disappointed by the movie. I was expecting a full retelling of the story of St. Paul's life, but all we got was a brief story about his last days. I was hoping for more of a Biblical epic. If you want to see more Christian films in theaters, go see it, however it comes nowhere near great Christian classics like A Man for All Seasons, Silence, or The Ten Commandments.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7832,2.8,-0.2

"7837",2.5,"  I can see how a faithful person would enjoy this movie and find tremendous meaning from it. But for anyone else this movie will be a bit of a bore. I thought this movie would be more of a historical drama of Paul's life and perhaps Luke as well. The performance of the actors was excellent I would gladly stipulate. I wouldn't see this again.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7837,2.8,0.3

"7842",5,"  Well done, fictionalized account of Paul's last days. Caviezel does a solid job as Luke, Martinez is really good as the Roman Prison Commander and Antonia Campbell Hughes turns in a solid performance as his wife. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that Priscilla and Aquila as well as the others in hiding struggle with their decisions, there is no *magic* solution and some turn aside. Very well done film.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7842,2.8,-2.2

"7850",5,"  Excellent movie. Caught the first showing this morning. Ignore the left-leaning Hollywood critics. This movie is very well-done and is true to text. Inspirational and moving. I would not expect non-believers to ""get it"", but really it is a good movie for all. Would Paul be willing to suffer such things for a lie? No way. This movie does an excellent job showing what the apostles experienced for Christ.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7850,2.8,-2.2
"7851",5,"  Wow, I wonder if most of the critics even watched the film. This film is the standard bearer to which all faith-based films should aspire. It is artfully made and spiritually rich. The acting is inspiring, the script is superb. Andrew Hyatt has a way of slowing his audience down so they can reflect on the deep implications of the scene. Like with most Christian films, the critics get it wrong. This movie is easily the best Christian film to be made since the Passion of the Christ.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7851,2.8,-2.2
"7852",5,"  A beautifully set and acted movie about a changed man. The story in Paul, Apostle of Christ is compelling and moving. How can man who once persecuted and killed Christians become one of the most important leaders in the history of the Christian church? In this film it's evident how Paul's encounter with Christ changed his life. It's a very relevant message for today because we live in a world that says, you are what you do. A world with no mercy, no forgiveness. Paul goes through a very human struggle, wrestling with his past, but the film shows how faith can allow you to change and that in order to love, Someone needs to first love you and embrace all of you. Even your past.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7852,2.8,-2.2
"7853",5,"  Absolutely beautiful! I am still crying - probably will be forever. This movie moved me like nothing else has in a long time.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7853,2.8,-2.2
"7854",5,"  It's ashamed that people still mock our Lord for he is good. Jim Caviezel that served the Lord with all his heart is being condemned in Hollywood for taking the biggest role of his life. The Lord knows who is good and who served him with no question. Hollywood may shut the door on Jim Caviezel but the Lords heavenly kingdom welcomes him with open arms. God Bless you Jim Caviezel.","Paul Apostle of Christ",7854,2.8,-2.2
"7855",5,"  Paul is one of my favorite saints and apostles. I am humbled that I travelled the places especially Italy and Greece where he evangelized during his lifetime here on earth.After I have read the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles of Paul now this is a physical and visual story of it.

Read the book of Romans. See the need of God's righteousness (1:18-3:20). See the provision for God's righteousness (3:21-5:21).

"7862",3.5,"  When it switches to the traditional illustrated animation of Beatrix Potter's paint and line work it's like magic. Well produced, designed and directed. The story is a little flat, and drags in places BUT the jokes are enough to keep a 7 year old and 9 year old on the ground crying with laughter. Domhall and Daisy FINALLY put on good performances in a movie. All round good fun for the family.","Peter Rabbit",7862,2.6,-0.9

"7866",4,"  Really funny family film. You have to wonder what these reviewers who give bad reviews see. Perhaps they should sit in a room full of families rather than sombre serious people looking for the next great thing. Lighten up! Family loved it. Laughed all the way through.","Peter Rabbit",7866,2.6,-1.4
"7867",3,"  That whirring noise you hear throughout the film is Beatrix Potter turning in her grave. Okay it's not that bad and to be honest this Peter Rabbit meets Home Alone is entertaining enough. Updates of old characters are not that uncommon these days - Batman, the whole output of Boomerang etc so it's only fair that Peter Rabbit gets it too although he already has on CBeebies. Some of the older concepts seem rather dated and quite frankly objectionable - thinking Rabbit pie here. James Corden as the voice? Well I'm not sure about that. However his performance is OSCAR worthy compared to his last one in the awful Emoji Movie.","Peter Rabbit",7867,2.6,-0.4
"7868",0.5,"  Awful on so many levels. Peter is naughty and rude at best, a pre-meditated murderer at worse. The film is crass and has a poor script. Very disappointing. My child was very upset that Peter tried to kill for a second time by firing a blackberry into Mr mcGregor's mouth even though he was allergic to it. He would have died had he not had an EpiPen. After we had a spell in hospital with anaphylaxis, this was really offensive and scary. Peter is a complete lefty marxisit who wants to take what others work for. just wholey bad bad bad","Peter Rabbit",7868,2.6,2.1
"7869",2,"  I didn't find it very funny and think it would have been better with potters original cartoon rather than this cgi rubbish. But the children in the cinema seemed to enjoy the violence a lot so I guess I just got old","Peter Rabbit",7869,2.6,0.6
"7870",1.5,"  If this wasn't ""Peter Rabbit"" but some generic animated film, I would have had far less problems with it. It is funny in places, and entertaining, but in the first half of the film displays an almost malicious under current with the rabbits dialogue more akin to some feral gang. I didn't really want my kids (5, 7, 9) to be watching it and siding with the rabbits. It's clearly been written with an American market in mind. By the end, the tone has changed and I don't consider the film a complete dead loss, but it's such a waste of potential. Paddington showed twice that you can retain the heart and charm of the original characters and themes. Peter rabbit is a lazy lowest common denominator effort that exists on the brash and lairy and a delight in violence that simply wasn't part of the potters original characters. Hence, in watching this I feel more like something was stolen from me rather than I wasn't intentional something new - a new worthy interpretation. It's like going to see the next terminator film only to find out it's about how humanity and skynet worked out their differences after a terminator fell in love with a resistance fighter, and most of the film unfolds in Shakespearian parlance. I ordered a hotdog, why did you bring me a falafel? I mean, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this felafel, other than the obvious fact it's not a hotdog. And that's real pity because I really wanted to like this film much more than I did, and really didn't have huge expectations, it was just so very far from the mark.","Peter Rabbit",7870,2.6,1.1
"7871",5,"  Love it! Havent a good laugh in a long time","Peter Rabbit",7871,2.6,-2.4
"7872",4,"  This movie has just enough comedy targeted at adults to keep you interested.","Peter Rabbit",7872,2.6,-1.4
"7873",2.5,"  The visuals of nowadays animation movies are absolutely mind-boggling. Even if it's only for this, this flick is worthwhile, even for an adult, as the animals, in their basic aspect as well as in their movements look perfectly real. I quite enjoyed it, though it is naturally more of a juvenile movie. The sound track has some good underlying Brit songs which give this flick a special touch. 5/10 points.","Peter Rabbit",7873,2.6,0.1
"7874",1,"  Very disappointing. The whole thing was extremely violent. The rabbits gloriously celebrated the death of Mr. McGregor (they showed him die and Peter poking the eye of his dead body) and the rest was them brutalizing Mr. McGregor?s nephew, who constantly tried to murder them. The entire movie was filled with adult themes and humor. Certainly did no justice to Beatrix Potter. Should have screened this one better.","Peter Rabbit",7874,2.6,1.6
"7875",3,"  A fun kids film, some laughs for adults, but maybe the most unlikeable main character I've seen for a long time, .","Peter Rabbit",7875,2.6,-0.4

"7877",1,"  Awful movie. There are a few funny parts, but this movie is not appropriate for kids. Let's start with watching a man die; he falls to the ground and dies. The rabbit's attitude is ""Oh well"" and then says the man deserved to die. Immediately after this death, the rabbit begins partying and moves into the man's house, because he says he deserves it. Then there is the long drawn out romance and kissing scenes between the human woman and human man that take up way too much of the movie. So many kids are turned off by that. I love kid movies, but this one is definitely not one to love. Extremely disappointing.","Peter Rabbit",7877,2.6,1.6

"7879",0.5,"  Ever since his father was put in a pie and eaten up by the grumpy old farmer Mr. McGregor (Sam Neill), Peter Rabbit (James Corden), his sisters Flopsy (Margot Robbie), Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki) and Cotton-tail (Daisy Ridley) and his cousin Benjamin Bunny (Colin Moody) spend their lives stealing vegetables from his garden, while also spending time with their human guardian Bea (Rose Byrne) who loves animals and painting. When Mr. McGregor dies of a fatal heart-attack, Peter thinks that his troubles are over for good. But when the old farmer's snooty nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) moves into the house with bigger and better rabbit-traps than ever, Peter vows to drive him out forever, especially when Thomas starts falling for Bea....Before J.K Rowling brought Hogwarts to life, before J.R.R Tolkien took readers to the mystical land of Middle-Earth, hell even before Michael Bond introduced a lovable bear with a passion for marmalade, the most iconic series of children's literature that ever existed were the stories published by Beatrix Potter. One of the most important contributors to the conservation of the Lake District and the National Trust, she was best known for the publication of her animal stories between 1902 to 1930 with her most well-known creation being the mischievous Peter Rabbit. Since then her stories have been adapted multiple times over the years, from a 1971 ballet film, A CGI show on Nickelodeon, the autobiographical film in 2006 Miss Potter, which told the story of her tragic relationship with her publisher Frederick Warne and finally The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, a 1992 animated mini-series that, in this reviewer's opinion, is one of the most beautiful, underrated examples of British Animation which isn't suprising as it was created by Dianne Jackson, best known as the director of the more famous short The Snowman who sadly passed way in the middle of the show's production.Making a live-action adaptation of these timeless stories was admittedly going to be a hard task to do in this day and age where adaptations are the norm and trying to remain faithful to the spirit of the source material while also doing your own spin on it can make or break a task like this. But as Paul King's excellent Paddington films have shown us, it isn't impossible. So what do you after watching those examples........................................................................................................................you give it to the same Dick-heads who thought twerking Nativity doves and a movie about Emojis was a good idea!Of all the terrible live-action reboots that have disgraced the silver screen over the years such as Josie and the Pussycats, Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas, this may be the worst example of those films ever made. Taking Sony Pictures Animation's worst traits which include desperately trying to be hip and cool with kids, obnoxious comic-relief and adding in so many dated pop songs in their soundtracks and amping them up to eleven in this modernized train-wreck is an insult not only those timeless stories, but is a giant middle-finger to adaptations in general. Look, I know that directors and screenwriters have to change things up from time to time, but they at least either try to keep the spirit of the original story intact or tell an equally timeless story themselves that can stand on it's own as an excellent film on it's own right, like Disney's Animated films.This does neither as it's story is so cliched, predictable and boring that one can even notice that Sony has blatantly taken the entire plot from their own Hotel Transylvania in it's narrative structure of someone finally getting rid of his enemy, only to discover that another enemy has decided to live on their land and fall in love with a female relative of the protagonist.Aside from Sam Neill's amusing cameo as the classic Mr. McGregor and Domhnall Gleeson getting a few funny moments as the overly snooty Thomas, the cast ranging from James Corden's obnoxious Peter Rabbit, Daisy Ridley's annoying ""weird"" sister Cotton-tail, Rose Byrne's awful ""Pixie-Dream Girl"" stereotype Bea and the cameos of other Beatrix Potter characters ranging from Sia's Mrs. Tiggy Winkle who encourages theft and vandalism, Ewan Leslie's Pigling Bland, once one of the politest and nicest characters in Potter's stories whose now reduced to a bad running gag in which he has an eating disorder and screams all the time, and the once terrifying Mr. Tod (Fayssal Bazzi) whose now obsessed with streaking and parties, are all so painful to watch that it, (I can't believe I'm saying this) makes the Transformers from the Michael Bay films look more closer to their own source material than these examples.Animal Logic's skill in creating some of the most incredible character animation as seen in the Lego movies and Happy Feet is sadly wasted here, as aside from one sequence that uses some beautiful hand-drawn animation drawn in the art style of the books that shows Peter's backstory and the death of his father, most of the realistic character animation is not suitable for a film like this.Overall, Sony Animation's Peter Rabbit is a travesty of a film that spits, shits and vomits on the legacy of Miss Potter and serves as further proof as to why Sony has one of the worst mainstream animation studios out there. You'd think that their recent Razzie Awards for The Emoji Movie would teach them a lesson, apparently not!","Peter Rabbit",7879,2.6,2.1

"7881",3,"  I enjoyed the film... loved Hux & Rey... I mean, Domhnall Gleeson and Daisy's characters. They stole the show for me. Peter himself was gawd damn awful... in terms of personality and Corden's wooden, read directly from the script, emotionless voice acting. Was he the best they could find? He made Peter annoying as hell. Rose Byrne's character wasn't that fun either. Still, Domhnall & Daisy made up for it. Take your kids... fun family movie.","Peter Rabbit",7881,2.6,-0.4

"7885",3,"  Delightful and charming. Peter Rabbit is not perfect, but certainly kept the children rocking with laughter as they watched the naughty rabbit cause mayhem in MacGregor's garden. The animation is impressive and almost seamlessly weaves into live action, and then into Beatrix Potter's classic water colours. Enjoyed the poignant backstory reflections of Peter's father without being overly melodramatic. A fun film even for the adults.","Peter Rabbit",7885,2.6,-0.4
"7886",4.5,"  Perfectly blended movie of the original story with pop culture, as well as the right temperature for a family. This film appeals to both kids and adults. Best ""kids' movie"" I have seen in a long while!","Peter Rabbit",7886,2.6,-1.9
"7887",5,"  Adorable, humorous, charming and a heartwarming tale just in time for Easter and spring! You will be hopping as fast as you can to catch up with the rabbits and all the other animals that are, once again, calculating how to get into Mr. McGregor's Garden. Peter Rabbit is based on the books by Beatrix Potter. Beatrix Potter lived from 1866 to 1943 and is one of the best-loved children's authors. She wrote and illustrated 28 books and each one has been translated into more than 35 languages. They have sold over 100 million copies. This is important because one of the main goals for the director and the cast was to stay true to her vision. The beauty of this film is that the rabbits all look as if you could touch them because the animation is so life like. The scenes with the garden and house look like places that I would enjoy living because they look like a fairytale that came alive. Of course, if you don't share your vegetables your life will not be enjoyable. The moral of the film is about getting along with others, telling the truth and being honest. Everyone makes mistakes and we need to find a way to fix them. Thump, click, crack, snap, thud - all these noises, plus thousands of other sounds effects add to the humor of this film. The music is outstanding. I cannot wait to purchase the soundtrack. There is a combination of movie symphony music, sounds from the 80s, new original songs and a plethora of songs and sounds that will put a smile on your face. Of course, the comical James Corden makes a perfect bunny. Peter Rabbit is my favorite character, full of sassy and classy moves and words of wisdom. His humorous and quick-witted lines made me burst out laughing when I watched the film. He also has a very kind heart, which I love. Corden brings his quirky personality that we see on his late night television show to this part.On the other hand, I also love the adorable Flopsy (Margot Robbie). She is so cute and cuddly, knows how to fend for herself and I just love her. She is the perfect role model for kids because she teaches how you can be both smart, cute and a fighter. Margot Robbie adds a bit of quirkiness to this character because she is the one and only Harley Quinn. She is the complete opposite - serious and tough - in the recent movie Christopher Robin. I loved meeting her in person.My favorite scene is when Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) is electrified by the bunnies. This scene is absolutely hilarious and quirky. I could not stop laughing. Seeing bunnies figuring out how to use an electric fence was shocking. Ever caring, kind Bea (Rose Byrne) is the sweetest. She is the hero who protects the animals at all costs. I relate to her a lot. She is funny and a bite odd. Cotton-Tail (Daisy Ridley) is one tough bunny. You know that this film is magnificent when the star of Star Wars appears in it. Cotton-Tail is young, yet very feisty and tough. It reminds me of her character in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I recommend this film for ages 6 to 18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. Kids will adore the bunnies and the other talking animals. The teenagers will love the hummer and fun scenes that the younger kids don't understand. This film is a perfect for the entire family so grab a bag of carrots, radishes and turnips and head to the theaters.Reviewed by morgan b., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org","Peter Rabbit",7887,2.6,-2.4

"7901",5,"  My husband and I went to see this movie shortly after it came out. It is my new favorite animated movie. It does not have much of the ""Shrek"" humor, more of ""Home Alone"" type of antics. Kept true to the story book with a modern twist. Loved it so much!","Peter Rabbit",7901,2.6,-2.4

"7903",3,"  I wanted to like this film and felt it would be fun but I just found it fairly crass and annoying. There are some good bits of slapstick humour and a few good puns. But what really ground my gears was James Corden and his constant loudness and overbearingness.The original books (as far as I can remember from my bunny years) were pretty alright and genteel. But I felt this was written by a London ghetto creature imposing themselves on the countryside. Like there was a point where all these animals go into the house, party and trash the place. And I just felt NO. This isn't respectful to the original at all and its not fun. Then another scene where the sweet singing sparrows keep falling out the sky or are hit by catapults by the bunnies. And it was just like no, you're ruining the spirit of this!The annoying thing is it was constant action, constant James Cordon being James Cordon. It did have some good points and was funny in places. On the whole I enjoyed it, but I want to cork James Cordon's mouth with a big fat carrot and rewrite the script so it was a bit more nuanced and 3-dimensional.","Peter Rabbit",7903,2.6,-0.4

"7918",1.5,"  Felt compelled to review this in case people thought it would be a charming movie about a beloved character. Aside from the odd comedy moment it was awful from start to finish. My little boy asked me if it was 'still the Peter Rabbit movie' at one point because it had veered off in some random direction. I felt most sorry for the family next to us who had brought their very elderly grand mother who presumably was looking forward to enjoying a beautiful movie with a classic character but instead got this. If we had been nearer the aisle I would have left the cinema and I've never felt like that before.","Peter Rabbit",7918,2.6,1.1

This movie has a lot of that.Yes, I have to be honest, I've enjoyed this movie from start to finish! Even the audience seemed to have enjoyed it! If it was just a cartoon movie, I wouldn't like it at all.But it seems to me that this is better and funnier than The Emoji Movie.I'm not into reading the original Peter Rabbit books, granted, but this film really shows that Peter Rabbit is a sweet character, even though he might not be the same as Paddington.Seriously, if you miss this film, you'll be having a meltdown!","Peter Rabbit",7919,2.6,-2.4

"7952",3.5,"  Raving rabbits. So you may already know the story of this rabbit named Peter who wears a blue jacket and repeatedly tries to get into his neighbor's vegetable garden for obvious reasons. This is taking it to the next level, and Peter (James Corden) has so many tricks up his sleeve that he will likely murder someone if he's not careful. I really only watched this in theaters because 1. I have a MoviePass, and 2. a mostly positive review caught my attention. I really haven't forgiven James Corden for being the worst part of the worst movie that came out in all of 2017 in The Emoji Movie, so I wasn't chomping at the bit to support his next project. When I had heard that he is actually unknowingly the villain in his own story, it was a dynamic that caught my attention. This movie is surprisingly decent. Now I could have very well just been in the right mood for this, but this was exactly what I was looking for on a lazy day off. The animation looks pretty good all things considered, and there is mischief, pranks and shenanigans throughout. I never at any point got bored with this, and while I may not have been getting big belly laughs, I did get a lot of chuckles and smiles watching this rabbit make Domhnall Gleeson's life a living hell. And speaking of Domhnall, he is having a lot of fun in this role. I don't know if he has any children or not, but sometimes actors want to let their proverbial hair down and do something wacky like this for kids to enjoy, and if their heart is in it, it will translate very well to the audience. That is exactly what happens here. Surprisingly, there is actually a controversy surrounding this film involving a plot point with a food allergy. While I will admit that it is kind of messed up when you see it happen, it felt in step with these somewhat malicious rabbits, and it didn't bother me all that much. This is cute and significantly better than it looks. I do think that kids will really like this, or if you just enjoy family films like I do, you are just going to have a good time with this. It doesn't do anything groundbreaking, and it is predictable as the story plays out, but it actually does a good job of setting up recurring jokes, and it is just better executed than you probably expect. I give Peter Rabbit an unexpected recommendation.","Peter Rabbit",7952,2.6,-0.9
"7953",5,"  AnimaTionn is fanastic. Rabbit actually hop. Plot is about love, changiing attitude, and admiting your actions. Warning dealth at beginning is not considered as bad. It is key to plot however.","Peter Rabbit",7953,2.6,-2.4

At the risk of curmudgeoning, I feel that the birds suddenly rapping and singing popular songs spontaneously took away from it for me. It had some other elements of that formulaic snarky self-awareness that plagues all modern adapted films. And even (spoiler of a spoiler alert) fell back on the campy stepping on multiple rakes gag. (Deep breath). Overall, though, my family of Middle age, young adult, and grade schoolers enjoyed it.","Peter Rabbit",7986,2.6,-0.4

"7993",2,"  This is probably a fun movie for the little ones. Age range 2 to 5 years old. Unfortunately, where movies like Ice age and other animated blockbusters have something to offer for everyone, Peter Rabbit gets stuck in seen-before slapstick sequences and repeated chase-scenes. The story-line is bumpy, like the writers were struggling with their lack of imagination and originality. It's difficult to actually say something about this movie, because the moment it's finished you've already forgotten you've watched it. I'm sure the Beatrix Potter-fans have something more to say about this movies. I have never read the books about Peter Rabbit, so I wasn't influenced while watching, but certainly wasn't impressed. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter","Peter Rabbit",7993,2.6,0.6

"8002",3,"  A very cute and funny movie. Decent enough to keep an adult interested throughout. The jokes were aimed at both adults and children and were reasonably funny. The only thing that didn't really fit was the poor choice of soundtrack music - modern pop songs just didn't fit with the countryside idyll the film was trying to portray.","Peter Rabbit",8002,2.6,-0.4

"8004",2.5,"  Cute, but not the true heart-warming portrayal I was hoping for. Too many adult themes for kids (wild partying and seemingly high or drunk characters) and too shallow for adults. We didn't get to know the characters enough to love them and I felt jipped by Peter's shallowness.  The movie was amusing, there were a lot of cute tender moments, but not enough to leave you satisfied with what the real story of Peter Rabbit was truly all about.","Peter Rabbit",8004,2.6,0.1

"8019",3,"  The American retelling of the British classic, Peter Rabbit, is adequate as fodder for parents who want to bring their young children to the movies for more than ten minutes of peace and quiet.  Headlined by amiable late-night host James Corden, the increasingly ubiquitous Domnhall Gleeson, comedy vet Rose Byrne, and the voices of ""Star Wars stud"" Daisy Ridley and recent Academy Award nominee Margot Robbie, Peter Rabbit was guaranteed to have some charm and the well-rounded ensemble helps keep Peter Rabbit afloat. James Corden's Peter Rabbit is sometimes obnoxious, always mischievous, but generally charismatic; at the end of the day, he's an animated rabbit you can get behind. Domnhall Gleeson plays the obsessive Mr. Thomas McGregor, who wants nothing to do with the wildlife of the area and may be too complex of a character for a movie like this (this is not a bad thing, it just surprised me that a character who is not presented as all bad or good showed up in a children's comedy). As far as his performance goes, Gleeson is pretty amusing to watch as he balances his fixation on getting rid of the rabbits permanently and hiding those feelings from Bea. Sometimes I heard a little General Hux (his character in the recent Star Wars movies for those unfamiliar) in his voice - I thought in one scene in particular he was about to go on a tirade about how the rebellion will bow down to the First Order. Rose Byrne and her character Bea go underused in the film; she shows up here and there, but the audience doesn't learn much about her other than she does not paint well and is a friend of the rabbits. The movie's ending would have been more dramatic and the audience more connected to the outcome if greater attention had been paid to her character.  The animation of all the critters is not stunning, but certainly good enough to not distract. The humor is primarily slapstick, with traps and chase sequences in the garden galore. There are also a lot of verbal jokes, some more clever than others. Overall the comedy isn't the laugh out loud variety, maybe more of a light chuckle. There are positive themes of family and the beauty of nature for children. Ultimately, Peter Rabbit is not as bad as I expected; I had a reasonably agreeable time watching it. P.S. I'm not interested in weighing in on the infamous allergy scene; the fact that I saw the movie after the controversy arose should say enough about my feelings towards the subject.","Peter Rabbit",8019,2.6,-0.4
"8020",3,"  Fans of the Beatrix Potter books may not be happy, but you can't please everyone. I know the rabbits are CGI creations, but they are just too damn ADORABLE to resist! Rose Byrne and Domhnall Gleeson are pretty darn adorable, as well. Sure, the film is overloaded with slapstick comedy and violence, but it's a basket full of fun!","Peter Rabbit",8020,2.6,-0.4
"8021",1.5,"  The movie is not completely horrible; it's just not remotely related to the story of Peter Rabbit. If you are a fan of Beatrix Potter's work, you might want avoid this movie. If you are instead just hoping to see a rather flat movie about a rabbit who is a self-centered jerk, this one will suffice.","Peter Rabbit",8021,2.6,1.1
"8022",3,"  This movie was honestly quite a bit of fun. I was laughing throughout. I found the humor to hit more than miss, for me. I think James Corden did great as Peter Rabbit. I am not familiar with the books, and I bet this isn't a faithful adaptation, so keep that in mind. If that is going to bug you then this movie isn't for you. But as a film itself, I found it to be really fun and its worth checking it out. Kids would love this movie","Peter Rabbit",8022,2.6,-0.4
"8023",2,"  IF YOU ARE READING THIS THEN IT IS PROOF THAT RT IS BLOCKING NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF BLACK PANTHER!!! That being said this movie, Peter Rabbit, suffers from a complete over representation of ""diversity"". It's a shame when a movie based in Europe is filled with non-Europeans.

"8045",3,"  I have to admit that I did not go in expecting to like this mainly due to the fact that I don't like cgi mixed in with real life actors and set. This movie surprised me. The toilet humor that is in so many of these movies was scant (maybe one scene), James Cordon as Peter Rabbit was okay, and while they did throw in current pop songs, they didn't last very long. The main human characters (one of them being Dominic Gleeson of Star Wars fame) did have good chemistry and I wasn't bored watching them together. So many of these Live Action/CGI movies have human characters that are just boring and don't really contribute to the plot enough for it to be non animated. Here I think it works. It's not perfect by any means, but the rabbit characters are all fun and interesting. If you're going for a straight adaptation, you will be disappointed (although original illustrations are featured (with a an actual purpose) as well as some beautiful animation. However, it was good and if all cgi/live actions tried what Peter Rabbit managed to do okay, then I would be more optimistic with these types of films.","Peter Rabbit",8045,2.6,-0.4

"8074",3,"  Will there ever be anything Hollywood won't make a movie out of? So far this year, we've had movies based on a song, a minutes-long incident, and now Peter Rabbit, the old children's tale from British author Beatrix Potter. It makes for a companion to Paddington 2, as both are about British animal cartoon characters, only while Paddington 2 is about a friendly bear in London, Peter Rabbit is about a rambunctious rabbit in the countryside.True to the setting, Peter Rabbit has a bright visual design. Vibrant foliage and garden plants litter the film. The countryside setting is itself picturesque (maybe literally, because I'm pretty sure the backgrounds are matte paintings). Bizarrely, that's the most delightful part of this movie. Even though Peter Rabbit is known for being a wholesome family story, the movie adaptation opts to base its style entirely on slapstick comedy. Most of it is too crude or immature to stick, but some gags managed to make me chuckle. Peter himself is characterized as a hard-to-like rogue. As for animation, most of the animals have lifelike CGI, with some exceptions, like a rooster who looks blocky and unfinished.However, Peter Rabbit has one saving grace. While the movie features, narration, training montages, and alternative and hip-hop (get it?) hits like any cliched family film, it utilizes these tropes to display self-awareness. At times, it feels insincere, but it brings a much-needed moral that redeems the otherwise blasphemous slapstick. Peter Rabbit tries to succeed by disregarding the source material and going down a conventional path. Barely, just barely, it pulls it off.","Peter Rabbit",8074,2.6,-0.4
"8075",2.5,"  Peter RabbitInitial Reaction: How many Peter Rabbits are there out there?Main Characters Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny: Two rabbits voiced by James Corden and Colin Moody. Bea: She's the next door neighbor. She 's played by Rose Byrne.Plot Summary Peter, his family, and his animal friends are doing their usual routine: Get into McGregor's farm and get as many vegetables as possible. But after a certain rain goes wrong, Peter gets caught by McGregor. But the old guy suffers a fatal heart attack and is whisked away. The animals think they've got their problems solved and have run of the place. However, a distant relative shows up several days later to fix up the place. The new guy, Thomas, turns out to be just as protective as the other McGregor - which really angers Peter Rabbit. However, Thomas' plans take hit a bump when he and Bea take a liking to each other. This makes Peter want Thomas out of the house even more.SCORINGMain Characters Peter and Thomas have some great moments near the end of the film, but there's not much to like about either one of them.  And I don't really like Bea because she's stuck in the typical ""girlfriend/peacekeeper"" character. SCORE: 6Supporting Cast The rest of the animals are okay, but not memorable. There's a hedgehog who acts like and elderly woman, several rabbit sisters arguing who's the oldest and the Peter's best friend who goes anywhere just to help him out. SCORE: 5Plot The film goes a bit overboard with the revenge plot between Peter and Thomas. Then it tries to resolve the problem in a way that's really short and ridiculous. SCORE: 4Originality It's your average family film - with talking animals. Wait, that still makes it your average family film. SCORE: 5Violence Factor A lot of bad things happen to Thomas - he gets electrocuted, has bear traps clamp onto his hands, suffers from huge falls, and so on. And yet, he's not hurt at all. Ridiculous. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film tries to show what happens when a small conflict gets out of control, but the way that conflict is resolved is a bit too fast and tidy.  And they fudge the rule about the animals and humans talking to one another. In several scenes, they can't do that but in a key scene, a human is having a normal conversation with an animal. SCORE: 5Final Score (out of 60): 29 % Score: 48.33% Peter and Thomas needed to be less of jerks then they are, and the main conflict needed to have a better resolution.","Peter Rabbit",8075,2.6,0.1

"8077",3.5,"  ""Peter Rabbit"" (PG, 1:33) is a shocking movie to contemplate. It's shocking to think that it took more than a century for the mischievous bunny of British scientist, illustrator and writer Beatrix Potter's early 20th century children's books to get the big screen treatment. Ah, but it was well worth the wait.In this live-action adaptation, the CGI Peter is voiced by James Corden. He leads his complicit, but more cautious little sisters, Flopsy (Margot Robbie), Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki) and Cottontail (Daisy Ridley), along with their clumsy cousin, Benjamin (Colin Moody), on regular raids into the garden of mean old Mr. McGregor (an unrecognizable Sam Neill). Peter is not just mischievous, he's selfish and reckless, often tempting danger in his pursuit of his ill-gotten vegetables. McGregor is in a constant battle with Peter, but just when it looks like the Old Man may have finally gotten the upper hand, he keels over.The country estate then passes to the meticulous and ambitious London department store supervisor, Thomas McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson). Thomas travels into the country to fix up the place so he can sell it and finance his dream of opening his own toy store. He soon finds himself in his own cat and mouse... er, human and rabbit... game with Peter. Doing her best to protest Peter from Thomas (much as she did with Peter's late great uncle) is next-door neighbor and animal lover Bea (Rose Byrne). As Thomas starts to fall for Bea, their blossoming relationship complicates his attempts to be rid of Peter once and for all. ""Peter Rabbit"" is a fun family film. The battles between the McGregor men and Peter get kind of mean-spirited at times, but the violence is mostly of the cartoon variety. The script by Will Gluck (who also directs) and Zareh Nalbandian is mostly well-written and cleverer than your average anthropomorphic animal tale. The voice cast is very good, Byrne's winning presence naturally enhances enjoyment of the film and the usually serious Gleeson proves surprisingly adept at comedy, especially the physical kind. Peter's personality and imperfections remind me of Surly Squirrel in the ""Nut Job"" movies, but Peter's a little bit sweeter. In the end, despite some uneven storytelling, Peter learns some lessons, as do the main live-action characters, and Movie Fans get a pretty enjoyable hour and a half at the movies. ""B+""","Peter Rabbit",8077,2.6,-0.9
"8078",0.5,"  This mean-spirited ""kid's"" film is a shameful depiction of a childhood classic. Whether your family deals with life-threatening food allergies or not, you will want to skip this waste of time unless you are interested in showing your family a ""how-to"" guide to being a bully. If you don't think kids follow the examples they see - like the sweet little bunny main character here - because ""come on, kids are smarter than that"" then I give you two words: Tide Pods. In this movie, said cute bunny intentional attempts to kill another character by forcing a deadly allergen in his mouth. And it almost works. How is this funny to anyone? Kids with these conditions didn't choose to have to deal with fear with every bite they eat just as much as kids with cancer or autism didn't choose their conditions. Yeah, it's just a movie BUT IT'S A KID'S MOVIE. These stars, producers, directors, studio execs should be totally ashamed of themselves for perpetuating this junk.

"8116",2.5,"  There's nothing wrong with a kids flick, is there? Kids like images, and they can easily be entertained. There are many examples of movies that have been released for kids, especially those from Disney, that have appealed to kids and have found great success. And then there's ""Peter Rabbit"", an adaptation of the stories by Beatrix Potter, that sort of misses the mark when it comes to making a movie for kids. While the film itself isn't terrible by all means, it does suffer quire a bit. More so in favor of the movie's direction than anything else. ""Peter Rabbit"" may be a kids movie, but it seems as if it is caught in its own trap of familiarity.The story follows the titular Peter Rabbit (James Corden), who, along with his siblings Cottontail (Daisy Ridley), Flopsy (Margot Robbie), and Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki), and his cousin Benjamin (Matt Lucas), steal vegetables from a nearby garden. But the garden belongs to Old Man McGregor (Sam Neil) who hates rabbits with a passion. One day, McGregor suddenly dies, and an heir named Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) is not too happy with Peter and his clan. Now, Peter must use his wits to get rid of Thomas so that the garden will be free, and their neighbor Bea (Rose Byrne) can accept either Peter or Thomas for affection.""Peter Rabbit"" offers up nothing new or exciting from previous kids films that make this film interesting. Going off the deep end, the major problem with this movie is with the pacing. The movie flows at an incredible pace, not allowing the viewer to slow down and take things in. This, in turn, can be attributed towards the camera; it moves rather fast, and all of the cuts in the movie make the viewer question what just happened.Throughout the entire production, we have a combination of both live action and animation; the animation provided by Sony Pictures Animation, which feels weak when compared to their previous features. Going right into the main flaw, the animation looks very realistic, and could have represented the actual drawings from the books that the main character comes from. Speaking of, there is a little section at the beginning of the film where we get to see the backstory of Peter, told through hand drawn animation, which is represented beautifully. Had the production used the art that was here on their key central characters, then the movie would have been fine to look at.The major problem with the film as a whole, is with the story itself. As one watches the film, they can find where the first, second, and third act is located. As well as many moments that do not make sense, and knowing where the film will be headed. ""Peter Rabbit"" has predictability written all over it.With that being said, there are one or two things that the film does manage to pull off. First, the cast does do a good job, despite the material they are given; all of the actors are given an over-the-top performance, but not too heavily. The one thing that does make the movie stand out is the cinematography. Everything from the landscapes to the sets, the movie more than makes up for it.But all of this doesn't excuse ""Peter Rabbit"" a standard by the books kids film.In conclusion, ""Peter Rabbit"" tries to be a good kids film, but ends up hopping away with its own mistakes.","Peter Rabbit",8116,2.6,0.1
"8117",0.5,"  Not seeing this. Peter promoting food allergy bullying where the victim needs to use epinephrine is irresponsible in normalizing food allergy bullying. Food allergy bullying is already a problem for kids today, why promote it? The movie didn't need this scene to make the movie. Meh, I'll pass. Paddington 2 sounds like a more positive, fun movie to me.","Peter Rabbit",8117,2.6,2.1
"8118",0.5,"  How dare the folks creating and producing children's entertainment that normalizes brutality to those with a food allergy? Why does this film include a scene where the identified character with a life-threatening food allergy and is targeted to die by others ""shooting"" that allergic food into the mouth of the allergic character? This is a hideous message for all children, let alone the very young who struggle to understand how they fit into society where they might be killed by accidentally eating the wrong thing, but now, they might also be intentionally killed by a bully? The entertainment industry needs to have a food allergy ""Time's Up"" moment, as well. Especially when it comes to the messages we are bombarding our children with. It is absolutely wrong to normalize bullying a child with a life-threatening health condition they neither asked for, nor wanted, but will have to spend the rest of their life trying to deal with. To include narratives where bullies go after those with an anaphylactic allergy just for laughs is nothing short of sociopathic. Writers, producers, directors, comedians should raise the bar when it comes to food allergies, because making fun of someone, usually a child, who can die from, say eating a peanut, is the same kind of cruel humor we longer tolerate anywhere else because it's just plain wrong. Didn't Punch and Judy in the Victorian age do comedy where ""the baby"" was constantly killed? Why isn't that done now? Well, because it's a crappy message, frankly, and targeting kids with life-threatening food allergies is the same thing. Stop using children's entertainment to normalize any bullying. Especially toward children who suffer great depression and enormous anxiety, and loneliness about the dangers of their allergy. When I was very young my mother took me to the Lake District to go see where Beatrix Potter lived. We owned every copy in print of her lovely, gentle, sweet books (Tales). I find it tragic that almost everything her work was about is being hacked and twisted into some angry, sociopathic war movie with messages of bullying and harm and anger being the driving force of the film. Not sure which writer came up with a film with hostility toward Potter as it's core engine, but it should appeal to those who don't care a bit about raising healthy children.","Peter Rabbit",8118,2.6,2.1

"8127",3.5,"  I am looking forward to this movie, the trailers look fun and I have become a Domhnall Gleason fan so this will be interesting. I will update with a proper review after I see it. Needless to say, I am certain it will be better (much better) than The Last Jedi. UPDATE: Plan to see it soon, as of this writing critics are rotten at 57% and audience is fresh at 77% -- unbelievable how wrong the critics are in most all cases, so I am expecting a pretty good movie now.My Take ....Ok, saw this movie and really enjoyed it. I was more than right, I was spot on. This film is 10X better than that abomination called The Last Jedi. This movie had everything that The Last Jedi did not. A strong plot, good character development, an intriguing story, and plenty of fun to go around. The jokes were expected and did not fall flat, there were no glaring plot holes and the film did a nice job of extending continuity to the source material (though I would not begrudge a person not liking this movie because it does not present the characters in a such a way as the source material did). It was fun, it was consistent, the tone was proper and the message was clear. I would definitely recommend this a good family night out with kids in the 6-12 range.","Peter Rabbit",8127,2.6,-0.9
"8128",5,"  This is a very clever and hilarious movie that I highly recommend to people of all ages. Bob Fitzpatrick and I went to see it tonight, and since we were at the 6:45 show, there were a lot of children in the audience. If you want to laugh with abandon at all the scenes, including the ones that involve butts and vegetable hits to the groin area, try to see it when younger kids will be in the theater so you can hide your own guffaws in their cackling. But even if you don't have the good fortune to see it with a load of children, there is plenty of less embarrassing stuff to laugh about, too.The plot is inane, but it's a good enough vehicle to provide a ton of great visual jokes. The dialogue is fast and smart, and like the best Disney movies, has the possibility of multiple layers of understanding. Everyone will be laughing, although what's funny about it will differ, even for the same lines sometimes. The live action characters in this do a very entertaining job and the animated characters' voices are perfect. There is quite a bit of good music in this movie, and some really cute dancing by the animated characters. I don't feel I'm doing this fun movie critical justice, so I'll just close this out by urging you to go. It's 95 minutes long and I swear you will leave smiling.","Peter Rabbit",8128,2.6,-2.4

"8130",4,"  Maybe it's because I saw it in a theater full of kids and families, but I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the classic tale. Very cute with a serious layer of effective slapstick humor, I legitimately laughed out loud several times. The casting and voice talent was well done. I highly recommend taking the kids to this one.","Peter Rabbit",8130,2.6,-1.4
"8131",2,"  To be fair, I went into this film with blinders on. Despite my trepidation at this being a Sony Pictures release (the same studio that botched both the Chipmunks and Smurfs franchises multiple times), I was still riding the high of Paddington 2 and was looking forward to another film that would put a loving yet fresh spin on a classic British children's character. BOY, was I disappointed! So much crass, juvenile humor, poorly written characters, and disturbing changes from the original source material( certain characters are deceased that weren't in the original books and cartoons, the animals turning the manor into a frat house, etc.). Growing up with the TIMELESS BBC Beatrix Potter collection, it was very hard to see such an integral piece of my childhood being used for a cynical down season cash grab. I wouldn't even take young children to it. Show them the BBC version instead, it's far more interesting and takes its time with the characters (ironic for a 30 minute special vs. a two hour film), and the art style (which they shamelessly incorporated at parts here too) is a wonder to behold. SAD!","Peter Rabbit",8131,2.6,0.6
"8132",3,"  An enjoyable family friendly ride. I enjoyed myself while watching this movie but the families in the audience seemed to of had more fun. There were some good laughs in this movie but there are also a few throw away ""fall down and get hurt"" jokes that were obviously meant for children. Overall it was a cute movie but no need to watch again unless occompanied by a child. I'd recommend for a family for sure, other than that don't rush to watch it but keep an eye out for it on a lazy Sunday afternoon","Peter Rabbit",8132,2.6,-0.4

Highly disappointed by the fact that Sherlock and Watson did not hook up in the end, although Watson did subtly graze Sherlock's butt in the final scene. I think you should get yourself a man who treats you like the strongest gnome in the garden. It was trippy when Sherlock went to the ""black and white"" world of his mind. It sort of felt like I was on an intense high all throughout the duration of this cinema masterpiece. I cringed at the sight of the thicc pie boy, who for some reason had a small selfie stick.

"8149",2,"  Sherlock GnomesInitial Reaction: Gee, wonder who's going to show up in this film.Main Characters Sherlock Gnomes: He's Sherlock Holmes if he was a gnome. He's voiced by Johnny Depp Dr. Watson: Sherlock's faithful assistant. He's voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor Gnomeo, Juliet: Two lawn gnomes voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt.Plot Summary A crime wave has hit across a neighborhood in London. Every single lawn gnome has vanished and there's one guy made for the job: Sherlock Gnomes. He and Dr. Watson have to follow the clues left behind by the culprit to find out where the lawn gnomes are. And they are going to get help from Gnomeo and Juliet - no matter if they want the help or not.SCORINGMain Characters They do a good job of showing Sherlock as the arrogant, egotistical know it all. And I also liked Watson as the quiet assistant who does what he's told. But Gnomeo and Juliet are really bland in this film. You could've substituted any two other gnomes and have gotten the same result. SCORE: 5Supporting Cast The rest of the lawn gnomes aren't really memorable - but they're not as bad as Moriarty. Sherlock's nemesis is portrayed as a creepy cute human kid (at least that's what I think he is). I really didn't like that. The master criminal deserved a lot better than this. SCORE: 2Plot The main plot goes about the standard business of following the clues - but the scenes don't really add up to anything special - except for the big reveal near the end of the film. SCORE: 4Originality This film is your standard mystery film. Making almost everyone a lawn gnome just doesn't do much for the story. SCORE: 4Violence Factor Not a lot - except for the many, many times a gnome is threatened to get smashed. Other than that, the confrontations between Sherlock and Moriarty have very little pop in them. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film has a romantic pairing between a frog and a lawn gnome - which just feels wrong.  Besides, there are times when Sherlock should be more through than he is in this film. He makes a few really bad mistakes that no other Sherlock would make. SCORE: 3Final Score (out of 60): 22 % Score: 36.67%Here's an idea - have an original story with the lawn gnomes instead of adapting some other person's work.","Sherlock Gnomes",8149,2.1,0.1

I can't even remember if I smiled once while watching this stupid movie ..... no no hold a second, I think I smiled once because they used the wilhelm scream and I believe that at this time I was supposed to cry or something.Of course the villain is so weak and his backstory and motives don't make any sense. By the way, the villain is just a miserable try to make a version of the joker in The Lego Batman Movie.The most infuriating thing is that the movie tries to make you feel it's smart; showing 2D animated scenes to display the way Sherlock Gnomes thinks or how he tries to solve the mystery and all that absolutely nonsensical. Also, there is a plot twist that is presumed to be surprising.there are man many other problem but let's get over them and mention the very few things that I liked in this movie:- The animation quality is surprisingly quite good.- James McAvoy's and Johnny Depp's voice acting are the only two that are kinda good but the other actors aren't good (Emily Blunt's voice acting is very idle)- The first 20 minutes are fast paced so I think this is a bonus! (The pace dragged every once in awhile due to ""dramatic"" moments or just to play some songs)I'm so disappointed that this movie came from John Stevenson, the same director who brought us Kung Fu Panda.

"8174",2.5,"  Grade: B-Rating: PG, 86 minutesIn a Nutshell: With original music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this gnome animation is a gentle introduction to Sir Arthur Conan Dole's classic story of Sherlock Holmes. It has action, comedy, good music, and uplifting themes, making it an entertaining movie for kids and watchable enough for parents.Tips for parents: Profanity like ""Cheese & Crackers!"" and ""Fertilizer!""You see quite a bit of a dancing gnome in a thong. If you saw the first Gnomeo & Juliet, you've already been introduced to Mankini, a character kids will laugh at, yet one who is pretty inappropriate for young children, in my opinion. The first Gnomeo & Juliet was rated G, but this one is PG for using some rude and suggestive humor. Mankini's appearances definitely bumped up the rating. There is some potty humor that will make most parents squirm.Some subtitlesAll British accents and landmarks in London.Uplifting theme: ""We all have our good and bad sides."" - Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor)""A man doesn't make you strong, but the right partner can make you stronger."" - Juliet (Emily Blunt)""We took our best friends for granted. We stopped listening. We stopped giving them the respect they deserved. They were the last thing we were thinking about and they should have been the first."" - JulietFamily and friendshipsThings I liked:Star-studded, award-winning voice talents include James McAvoy, Johhny Depp, Michael Caine, Emily Blunt, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Maggie Smith, and Mary J. Blige.The animation is very well done with impressively expressive characters.Lots of physical gags and entertaining visuals.Fun soundtrack of popular hits and new songs.It uses several different types of animation, which I thought was cleverly done.A couple of twists. I love twists.The sound effects were really good, allowing you to hear the clay pots and hear the weight of the gnomes.Stay to the end of the rolling credits to see a few more little things.Kids will like the use of modern technology in the story telling.Things I didn't like:Sherlock Gnomes is pretty annoying and not very likable. If only they had gotten Benedict Cumberbatch to play the voice! He does a fantastic job in the TV adaptation. That would have been awesome and hilarious. Don't get me wrong, because Johnny Depp was fine, but Cumberbatch as Sherlock...come on!There are a lot of jokes that kids simply won't get because they're references to older generations, like the River Dance gag.I started to get bored. It felt like a video I would put on for my kids at home to keep them occupied while I got some work done.Funny lines:""To be fair, it was needlessly complicated, but that's what super villains do."" - Moriarty","Sherlock Gnomes",8174,2.1,-0.4

"8177",2.5,"  It's been a couple of hours after watching Sherlock Gnomes and I still have alcohol working through my bloodstream (a byproduct of having to watch Sherlock Gnomes) and so I thought why not begin the review writing process and see where this goes. A little pretext first: I had no intention of watching this movie. Every time its trailer came before a movie I was watching, I cringed harder than I ever have. I cannot remember another movie trailer that I would describe as soul-killing as this one, with its emphasis on butt humor and an extended joke about a thong-wearing gnome farting in the mud. To watch this trailer was to look into the empty abyss and have it look back into you. It was this repulsed reaction that entertained my friend Ben Bailey so much that he insisted that we watch Sherlock Gnomes one fateful evening (he paid for my ticket and my suffering). I loaded up at the theater's bar and the bartender made the easiest upsell he ever did in his life, and I took my tall adult beverage, sat in the theater, and awaited the end, like a man heading toward execution. Then a funny thing happened and Sherlock Gnomes was not the film advertised in its abysmal, life-questioning trailer. It's still not great, though.Following the events from the 2011 original, Gnomeo and Juliet, the garden gnomes have relocated to a new home in London. Gnomeo (voiced by James McAvoy) and Juliet (voiced by Emily Blunt) are entrusted with the gnome-specific responsibilities of the garden by gnome leadership. I guess it's about making the place look nice. Anyway, Sherlock Gnomes (voiced by Johnny Depp) and his trusty sidekick Watson (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor) are looking into the disappearance of gnomes all over. One unfortunate day, while Gnomeo and Juliet are away from their garden, the rest of the gnomes have been kidnapped. Sherlock Gnomes and the others vow to find them, believing the culprit to be Sherlock's longtime nemesis, Moriarty (voiced by Jamie Demetriou).Remarkably, a solid 80 percent of the trailer for Sherlock Gnomes is not in the finished film. The fart Jacuzzi? Gone. The ""no ship Sherlock"" bit? Gone? The thong-wearing gnome twerking? Gone. This fascinates me. We've long been plagued with trailers that ultimately have moments not in the final product, but I've never seen a movie, let alone an animated feature, where the clear majority of its trailer does not exist. Animated films takes many years in development and are generally costly. If a live-action film cuts footage in its final edit, it lost those days of work. If an animated film cuts footage in its final edit, it lost months if possible years of toil. How does this happen? Was the trailer an intentional ruse meant to advertise a far more juvenile, base, and dispiriting movie? The trailer features several jokes or references that, I assumed, were never intended for the final product because these scenes involve the other gnomes who were kidnapped. That means they were animated and either radically changed the story or these jokes were cynically constructed to produce a misleading trailer to appeal t children with farts. This truly fascinates me and befuddles me, a worthy mystery for Sherlock Gnomes.The actual Sherlock Gnomes film I sat through wasn't actively painful but it wasn't particularly engaging or rewarding either, a mediocre children's movie that will vanish from memory upon the ride home. There were a handful of moments where I rolled my eyes but no joke, no pun, even approached the pain of that trailer. On the flip side, there was perhaps two jokes that drew a mild chuckle and that was it. For the majority of the 86-minute running time, I just sat and took it all in, never really engaging. It was boring yet inoffensive, colorful yet unimaginative, and derivative yet silly enough to be a trifle. The look of the animation as a bit more polished than I was anticipating. The use of lighting and scale is well balanced. The voice acting was acceptable from the star-studded cast and I didn't feel any great sadness for anyone's involvement. The lessons and plot twists will be predictable enough for someone over the age of eight, but hey, everybody needs to learn some time. The use of the Elton John song catalogue (he is a primary producer) is the most forced element in the film, elbowing in one song or another, including ""original songs"" that you won't even remember. Much like the rest, John's contributions are mediocre and easily forgotten.I kept wondering about the lazy world building and its implications. This is a clear application of Pixar's oft-used formula of the secret-life-of, this time with garden gnomes. Except there's a segment where Sherlock and Juliet go to a club populated with dolls, stuffed animals, and toys of all sorts. So it's not just garden gnomes that are secretly alive, it's also children's toys. Which means this is essentially the same universe as Toy Story. For whatever reason, and maybe it's a misplaced sense of novelty, we stick with the gnomes. These creatures worry about being smashed, though can they be put back together much like Humpty Dumpty (except he couldn't be put back together even with the help of all the king's men and horses, no never mind this references. Also, what good are horses going to do putting together the shattered pieces of an egg-man? Do horses have thumbs to pick up the broken pieces? I feel like this entire aside might be attributable to the alcohol still in my system). If breaking is their biggest fear, why do these gnomes take such unnecessary risks with their safety and well-being? When Gnomeo is tossing Juliet in the air atop a ladder, I worried for her little gnome life. This cavalier attitude prevails amidst the larger gnome community, and my only conclusion is that these creatures are either thrill-seeking junkies or masochists. Then I began thinking of the life of other garden gnomes. I assume most gnome-owners don't exactly have an entire menagerie of these things, and so the majority of gnome existence must seem awfully isolated and lonely. Their communities must be few and far between. Then I started thinking about transforming past Best Picture-winners into gnome format, and let's just say that 12 Years a Garden Gnome was not a good idea for anyone.This is a sequel and combined spin-off for the animated gnomes world, so the holdover characters often feel superfluous. This is clearly more of a Sherlock vehicle and there are even references to the Hound of Baskervilles and The Final Problem, among others. This is trying to establish a Sherlock Gnomes franchise first and foremost. The Gnomeo and Juliet subplot feels rushed and foolishly resolved. Now tasked with running the garden, Juliet feels overwhelmed with pressure and Gnomeo feels like he isn't getting attention. Rather than support her, or see things from her perspective, he pouts and accuses her of taking him for granted. To conclude this storyline, she actually apologizes, and I shouted, ""Apologize for what?"" A better rendition of this storyline is realized with Sherlock Gnomes repeatedly being indifferent to Watson's contributions. When the main theme, character arcs, and plot points involve new characters, you might as well get rid of the holdovers and go all-in on Sherlock Gnomes. Was there a picky audience that would have said, ""I will only accept another gnome-related children's film if it has the tiniest connection to the last gnome-related children's film""? Also, there's another garden gnome children's film on the horizon, Gnome Alone, so stay tuned, gnome aficionados.The victory is that Sherlock Gnomes is not the seventh-seal-breaking apocalyptic event that its reprehensible, punishing, life-sapping trailer suggested. Hooray for you, Sherlock Gnomes filmmakers. The finished product is still a mostly middling time-waster that feels like a Gnomes relaunch. I fully admit this movie was never intended for someone my age, but I attempted to see its merits for its intended audience. If you have young kids, this is a reasonable 86-minute time waster while you, presumably their parent, can do something, anything better with that time. Go back to that novel you keep pushing off. Have some alone time with yourself or another person. Or simply close your eyes and enjoy the silence. Whatever you do, Sherlock Gnomes is an adequately forgettable comic adventure that will afford you time to think.Nate's Grade: CUPDATE: Thanks to the amazing connectivity of the Internet, someone closely involved with the Sherlock Gnomes production contacted me to inform me that my theory about the trailer discrepancy was correct. Paramount;s marketing team wrote the trailer and insisted the production spend valuable time animating it. The more juvenile jokes were designed, as this source indicated, to put as many butts in the seats opening weekend, and that the marketing department knew best, and that was that. The production spent time creating scenes for a trailer they had no intention of ever being in the finished film, scenes that badly characterized what kind of movie it would be. You can blame Paramount's marketing department for the soul-killing trailer. Thanks, Sherlock Gnomes source, for reaching out and clearing up that mystery.","Sherlock Gnomes",8177,2.1,-0.4

"8186",3.5,"  It was alright. I felt like this film was a response to BBC in many ways. It took the modern misconception of Holmes being a jerk and portrayed how others around him may react if that was the case, and had him learning a lesson in the end. Watson was done very well, and the film respected that character as having is own skills, abilities and intelligence, which was appreciated and almost makes up for how annoying Holmes was through most of the film.It also did not fall down the common pitfalls of inventing a false relationship between Irene and Sherlock (although I would have liked it more if her husband Godfrey Norton was featured), and tied that encounter with another case from the stories. There were a few other mentions and nods to the stories and other adaptions which was fun to spot. Although it is not on the same kind of level as The Great Mouse Detective, it was still a relatively enjoyable film for what it was.","Sherlock Gnomes",8186,2.1,-1.4
"8187",5,"  i really liked this movie!","Sherlock Gnomes",8187,2.1,-2.9
"8188",2.5,"  Sherlock Gnomes is a frequently clever animated film that has a few fun moments, yet suffers from a jumbled story and too many characters to fully engage you in the movie as a whole.Sherlock Gnomes is a sequel to Gnomeo and Juliet and brings together garden gnome versions of the famous detective and the Shakespearean couple from the first installment. Gnomeo and Juliet move to a new garden in London that disappoints their entire faction of gnomes. Gnomeo and Juliet are appointed the new leaders to turn the garden into a beautiful wonderland for their little village. Meanwhile, several gardens have been erased of all signs of gnomekind and soon, Gnomeo and Juliet's is too. The dynamic duo of the incredibly smart, but sometimes selfish detective and protector of London's garden gnomes Sherlock Gnomes and his trusty sidekick Watson are on the case and intend to catch the culprit and track down the missing gnomes, with the help of Gnomeo and Juliet.Unfortunately the collision of these literary duos doesn't work very well. Their stories have very different characters and tones. The film makes clever references to Sherlock Holmes and his works that will be enjoyable for fans of the character's inspiration, but the collaboration still feels forced. Gnomeo and Juliet go through a storyline that feels out of place and their conversations have a repetitive message. The characters feel less developed against the more engaging Sherlock. Gnomes.My favorite character is Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp). He embodies the qualities of the literary detective and makes his portrayal of Sherlock his own, giving him a more fun and comedic manner. He also nails Sherlock's complex relationship with Watson.I recommend this film for ages 5 to 9 due to some crude humor. Younger kids will enjoy the film's bright colors and caper elements and older kids and adults might enjoy some of the humor. However, this film lacks the vivid animation and nuance that offers the same wide appeal of other animated films. I give it 2.5 out of 5 stars because the story is a bit confusing, although it has some characters and good laughs. Reviewed by bENJAMIN p. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"8192",5,"  Is Gnomeo and Juliet Sherlock Gnomes the worst movie ever made? No. Is the Gnomeo and Juliet Sherlock Gnomes the best movie ever made? Yes. The new installment to the best film franchise has little to no flaws and should be seen by everyone. It is truly an amazing blockbuster film that should be Oscar nominated and Oscar winning. Sherlock Gnomes is a cinematic masterpiece. You need a IQ over 200 to comprehend the genius of this movie. Now critics have been rating this film down, but those are just haters that deserve to be dabbed on to the fullest extent. They are just a bunch of Gnomist! We must stop this gnome racism!! I will stand for a 10/10 movie with no flaws get slaughtered by this Gnome inequality!!! #Gnomelivesmatter #GomeequalityNow the genius of a director, John Stevenson, provides an amazing original story about love, importance of partnership, and the current state of racism in our political news. The surprising plot twist are amazingly surprising and leaves at the edge of your seat the whole movie. And if you are wondering, yes there is at least one dab. Watching that for the first will definitely not make question your life choices and leave you asking yourself, ""What terrible life choices have I committed in my life to be here,"" yeah you won't feel like that. But remember as amazing as this movie is there is one flaw. In the ended the Characters don't fuck. Yes, yet again you will be left with the feeling of what jacksfilms left when he finished watching the emoji movie and I quote ""Blue Balls."" Now I think an appropriate ending to this film would have an ending similar to that of sausage party's. But if you are like me, or any normal person, you had your hand in your pants under your underwear, waiting for that perfect moment to ejaculate, and it never came. You will either have to wait until you get home to finish, or you could do what I did which is finish in the bathroom while the images of the movie are still fresh in your head, because if there is one word I could describe Juliet is THICCC, with 3 c's. That is why you will be left with blue balls. The characters got that junk in the trunk, if you know what I mean hehehe (even the frog). Another complaint, there is no twerking. I mean you give the character that back and you don't even make'em shake'em. But those are just minor flaws that don't really effect the film that much. Another thing that is amazing about the film is the side plot about Benny wanting to bang the frog. It is amazing little love story that I would want to see the abominations that they would call their children. The character development is also an aspect that is handled perfectly. Sherlock Gnomes and Juliet go from being assholes to not assholes. The dialogue is also superb. From the jokes to the serious moments, you will find that the dialogue will always be the most perfect thing to say in that situation. And I will go into a spoiler for a couple of these sentences so I will just say, if you have not watched this masterpiece of a film just skip over this because this film is a must watch. So anyway, there is a tragic and heartbreaking death that will definitely make you cry is you are a decent human being. If you do not cry at this scene you are a soulless and heartless human being that does not cry at all and I want nothing to do with you (asshole) not you only the people that do not cry at this scene. Which will be no one I assure you. Yes Sherlock Gnome's very own assistant Watson does break and it is the saddest moment in film history. This scene is so well done and emotional, because the director and writer does and amazing job at making love and feel for these characters. I know that when I experience this very #emotional scene I was heartbroken and just sobbing. I was crying out loud, could not believe it. That is the only spoiler in this review, I'm sorry I had to spoil that it is just the most emotional experience you will ever get to see.In summary, Sherlock Gnomes is the finest piece of cinema I have seen since Gnomeo & Juliet. It rivals and manages to beat all of Shakespeare's work (including the very play the characters are inspired by ""The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet). It is the definition of what a cinematic masterpiece is and what films should aspire to be.","Sherlock Gnomes",8192,2.1,-2.9

"8214",0.5,"  Thi is a quite bad movie. I don't understand why it is considered a comedy when there is a lot of killing going on. I don't know why there is fun made of a dead body of dictator even if we know he was awful. I guess because I live behind the iron curtain, I don't understand such ""humor."" Why is F-word used over and over without reason is another reason why I can't give it more stars. How disappointing.

"8217",1,"  One hour into the movie, neither me, or my wife, or the whole theater audience save for one guy in the back row had chuckled once.

"8218",2.5,"  Chosen for its cast, sadly disappointing","The Death of Stalin",8218,4.1,1.6
"8219",1,"  I went into the theatre expecting to laugh - I laughed twice! The movie could not decide if it was trying to be a comedy or a sick twisted farce. It succeeded a bit as a farce - but it was not funny at all. It got really perverted when they shot Beria in the head and then set his dead body on fire.","The Death of Stalin",8219,4.1,3.1

"8225",1,"  What an annoying stupid movie. I guess it was supposed to be a satire but not that funny, mostly pathetic. And whatever technique they used while filming made it seem out of focus out of the time which gave me a headache and forced me to keep my eyes closed a lot.","The Death of Stalin",8225,4.1,3.1

"8229",2.5,"  I really wanted to love this movie. There are some incredible comedic actors in it and it's all well-acted. It's honestly just not very funny. It tries to be funny but the jokes fall flat. I couldn't tell if it was scripted or improv in many cases because it seemed like one liners were added in the shoots that weren't crafted. I honestly think many of the positive reviews are because people really expected it to be great more than they experienced a great film.","The Death of Stalin",8229,4.1,1.6
"8230",2,"  The farce is strong is this historical train wreck. Bleh.","The Death of Stalin",8230,4.1,2.1
"8231",4.5,"  The post-Stalin Russkees knew how to play ""hard ball"". This was a well acted film that portrayed the evils and stupidity of the Malenkov/Bulganin/Kruschev/Molotov era in a most graphic way. The political humor was there but most often subsummed by the cruelty and nefarious scheming by the Stalinist proteges. Beria was a prime example of Soviet evil at its apex. Enjoyable, and a bit ""over the top"" but educational and ""dark"" nevertheless!","The Death of Stalin",8231,4.1,-0.4
"8232",2,"  Buffoonish and deadly boring. I quickly lost patience trying to follow the silly plot and ridiculous machinations by myriad characters. I would never have gone to see this movie except for the rating by Rotten Tomatoes. Leaves me in doubt about relying on RT to choose movies in the future.","The Death of Stalin",8232,4.1,2.1

"8234",5,"  Director Armando Iannucci delivers another A+ political satire with The Death of Stalin, a film just as sharp, ballsy, and hilarious as his 2009 debut In The Loop.","The Death of Stalin",8234,4.1,-0.9
"8235",5,"  A must-see. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, with a generous heaping of well-earned laughs from a biting script. And the filmmakers wisely spread the laughs a little thinner as the film moves into more serious territory.","The Death of Stalin",8235,4.1,-0.9
"8236",0.5,"  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not funny. Not serious. Not fun. Not cerebral. A total waste of time. I need to read some reviews to find out what 96% of critics saw that I didn't.","The Death of Stalin",8236,4.1,3.6
"8237",3,"  Some of the punch lines go by so fast it's hard to catch all of them. It was hard to reconcile a comedy with all the atrocities that were taking place.","The Death of Stalin",8237,4.1,1.1
"8238",4.5,"  A comical farce of at times Mel Brooks-like flavor though so much darker, but that level of absurd interaction between hollow people in crisis... you laugh and you laugh and then the ending hits you square in the forehead, and out the back with your mind blown, as you suddenly remember and realize who you are watching on screen and what happened next in reality... that the farce you just watched is only lightly fictionalized and that it bears all-too-real resemblance to a more current farce here in our own nation, and all that laughter goes to a dark, quiet, far off place....","The Death of Stalin",8238,4.1,-0.4
"8239",4,"  A surprise, and a ""good"" movie. Perhaps a breath of fresh air considering the state of the business.","The Death of Stalin",8239,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8240",4,"  While the bigger picture might get lost in the feverish antics and general hilarity, Death of Stalin is a great comedy with some serious things to ponder.","The Death of Stalin",8240,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8241",4,"  I saw The Death of Stalin Saturday at the AMC Rolling Hills 20 using my Movie Pass (which again worked as advertised). This movie is a dark, satirical comedy about the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1947 and the events leading up to it and afterwards. A great cast in a movie that reminded me of a dark, bizaro Blazing Saddles or Saturday Night Live.","The Death of Stalin",8241,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8242",1.5,"  I think I chuckled lightly twice. Very boring movie.","The Death of Stalin",8242,4.1,2.6
"8243",5,"  I want everyone associated with this movie to make the Trump movie when it comes out! Brilliant, hilarious, unusual. Simon Russel Beale is a gem turning one of histories worst players into well, a comedic monster. Buscemi is perfect, as he always is, I laughed out loud a dozen times, at least, and after, went to looking these people up. Had to know the real stories and - amazingly - this isn't far from the truth. Congratulations to all involved.","The Death of Stalin",8243,4.1,-0.9
"8244",2.5,"  The Death of Statlin is an odd eent for a comedy. This is what still has me shaking my head adn that was the tione of the movie. It is very amusing in an ironic way because the events how portrayed were real but many of the events seen and heard about were indiscriminate killing, torturing, and imprisonment, still hard to find laughable. As much as I am huge fan of Veep, I really didn't get this movie at all and am disappointed that I didn't connect to it","The Death of Stalin",8244,4.1,1.6
"8245",1,"  Have not seen anything remotely engaging since 'Shape of Water, really hope this would break the drought...havibg said that - would probably work well in live theatre","The Death of Stalin",8245,4.1,3.1
"8246",5,"  Chilling, dark humor. So well done.","The Death of Stalin",8246,4.1,-0.9
"8247",2.5,"  Walked out after 45 minutes poor excuse as Russians font have englishAccents. Not even funny as a dark comedy, rotten tomatoe score way Off unless you have trouble sleeping then score is correct","The Death of Stalin",8247,4.1,1.6
"8248",4.5,"  Dark and funny political satire. Given what's going on in Russia right now, it's also a timely movie. Watching the power struggle that happened after the death of Stalin was hilariously portrayed in this movie and was actually made funnier by having Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor play Khrushchev and Malenkov. I wound up really liking this movie","The Death of Stalin",8248,4.1,-0.4
"8249",5,"  If you can handle pitch black comedy do not miss! Great acting, relentless, almost action movie-style pacing. And, of course, with the rise of authoritarian governments, timely.","The Death of Stalin",8249,4.1,-0.9
"8250",2,"  Hard to be as enthusiastic as other reviews because the poor audio made it difficult to catch all the dialogue. Whether it was the audio of the theater, the audio recording at time of filming, or poor directing of the actors related to speaking parts. May try to see it again at another venue, but will do so after a quick history refresher.","The Death of Stalin",8250,4.1,2.1
"8251",4,"  It's often raucously hilarious, neatly crafted, sometimes visually striking, packed with excellent performances and abrasively profane dialogue. Most significant of all, it's true.","The Death of Stalin",8251,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8252",5,"  The Death of Stalin is one of the best big-screen satires I've seen in years. The all-star cast included many actors from English theatre. They brought the best of the stage with them, from excellent body language to perfect comedic timing. The film had everything that is required to make a dark, uncomfortable, complex and historical drama something worth laughing and thinking about. The film also did a great job of communicating to outsiders what is known about the last days of Stalin's rule and has a great time exploring the possible dramas that might have ensued in the wake of his death. Buscemi, Peale and Tambor stand out as excellent players, although they are well supported by a strong cast and robust writing. The Death of Stalin is one of my new favourite movies. While the genre may be too dark for the mainstream, this picture is certainly an instant cult classic.","The Death of Stalin",8252,4.1,-0.9
"8253",3.5,"  Enjoyable, amusing farce. not many big laughs.","The Death of Stalin",8253,4.1,0.6
"8254",4.5,"  Manages to be funny while telling the truth. Very dark.","The Death of Stalin",8254,4.1,-0.4
"8255",2.5,"  It had its moments, but wasn't nearly as much a comedy as I was expecting. The gestalt joke of it got a little old by the end of the movie. That said, Jeffrey Tambor's performance was probably the best.","The Death of Stalin",8255,4.1,1.6
"8256",1,"  Boring, superficial farce and a painfully missed opportunity.","The Death of Stalin",8256,4.1,3.1

"8261",5,"  Loved this movie. Absolutely brilliant satire and the acting is terrific.","The Death of Stalin",8261,4.1,-0.9
"8262",0.5,"  PROPAGANDA, barely veiled. This movie tried to make a joke of a vast State-led web of violence against society including forced disappearance, torture and rape. Never okay, especially in an era where fascism is gaining momentum across the western world. Furthermore the ridiculousness made it Impossible to discern historical accuracy in the film. There was no protagonist to cheer for. to be fair, plot arc was satisfying and there was some okay acting. Overall this film was a cheap(by which i mean hugely costly and timewasting) shot at Putin.","The Death of Stalin",8262,4.1,3.6
"8263",4.5,"  Paddy Considine is the director of Radio Moscow. The evening's entertainment is a Mozart piano concerto. He receives a phone call from Josef Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) saying he would like a recording of the concert. The problem is that nobody has recording it. Considine panics and refuses to let the orchestra or the audience leave, staging the whole concert over again to get the recording, although he needs to bribe pianist Olga Kurylenko, replace the conductor who has passed out, and grab some spare audience members off the street. This sets the tome for this amazing film. Stalin dies this same night, setting off a power struggle between Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and Lavrenti Beria (Simon Russell Beale). Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor) is nominally in charge, but a war of deceit and manipulation ensues to see who can out maneuver each other and take the rains. This is a hilariously black comedy, until it turns immensely dark and isn't a comedy anymore. These shifts in tone are handled with aplomb and you barely notice that you've stopped laughing and are gasping in horror.","The Death of Stalin",8263,4.1,-0.4
"8264",4,"  ""The Death of Stalin"" is a deep farce, but it is rooted in enough political reality that it hardly feels sensationalized. And given the current state of politics, it's as on-point as a breaking news alert.","The Death of Stalin",8264,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8265",5,"  Fast-paced, manic, and dark as Hades. The Death of Stalin takes an amazing cast and hands them a fabulous script. Laughing and horrified at the same time. Well worth seeing.","The Death of Stalin",8265,4.1,-0.9
"8266",3.5,"  Entertaining and funny","The Death of Stalin",8266,4.1,0.6
"8267",2,"  ""The Death of Stalin"" is an ambitious film that attempts to tackle overwhelmingly dark subject matter with wit and although it does manage a few laughs it come off as irreverent.","The Death of Stalin",8267,4.1,2.1
"8268",2,"  I give the film high marks for scenery, costumes, and a story based upon history. I expected a farcical comedy with dark humor and viewed a film with extreme dark comedy marked with frequent violence and abusive behavior that took away considerably from the intent of a satirical movie. The actors, however, all did their best. I heard infrequent laughs from the audience.","The Death of Stalin",8268,4.1,2.1
"8269",5,"  Very well done and funny too. It is the rare writer and director who can turn a story of terror, murder, intrigue and depsoitism into a buffon comic opera. The cast is great and who wouldn't love Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khruschev?","The Death of Stalin",8269,4.1,-0.9
"8270",4.5,"  This is a fantastic contemporary piece of bureaucratic absurdism. Armondo Ianucci's hyper realistic approach to the chaos that ensues once centralized government collides with the worse aspects of human nature. Fantastic performances and razor sharp writing make this darkly comic depiction of its eponymous subject all the more gripping.","The Death of Stalin",8270,4.1,-0.4
"8271",5,"  Dark fun movie, a definite yes go see.","The Death of Stalin",8271,4.1,-0.9
"8272",2,"  This film is supposed to be an uproarious dark comedy. It is dark. The Three Stooges moments are a little humorous. Unfortunately, the story is accurate enough that you can't forget the horrors of Stalin's regime. Steve Buscemi's conniving Kruschev and Jeffrey Tambor's bumbling Malenkov are the highlights of the movie.","The Death of Stalin",8272,4.1,2.1
"8273",4,"  Who would have guessed that a movie about the death of Stalin and the subsequent jockeying for power to take his place could be done as a vaudeville piece? And be successful! This is a bold experiment that really works, complete with very serious scenes of force and slapstick to give a dizzying feeling of what was going on in 1953 Russia...","The Death of Stalin",8273,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"8276",1,"  My husband and I were looking forward to what we'd been led to believe would be a smart and very funny film. Neither of us laughed at all. We generally like dark comedy, dry humor, and historical satire, but this simply wasn't funny at all. Only a few people in the theater laughed, but they laughed pretty hard. Maybe they'd spent more time at the bar than we had. It was one if the worst films we've seen in a long time.","The Death of Stalin",8276,4.1,3.1
"8277",1,"  Terrible movie. I guess it was Russian slapstick, but it wasn't funny and it was dark comedy that made fun of killing people and other painful activities.","The Death of Stalin",8277,4.1,3.1
"8278",5,"  Scathingly brilliant. Such dark subject matter, but done so brilliantly it's laugh out loud funny. All the actors are fantastic and Steve Buscemi is absolutely fantastic. I just saw it and I want to see it again as soon as possible","The Death of Stalin",8278,4.1,-0.9
"8279",4,"  Not an expert on the history of Russia in the 1950s but this movie showed the the political realities of leadership change in a very farcical and "" Monty Python-ish "" way.

Did the above critics see the same movie I saw?""GreatMartin""The Death of Stalin"" is set in the 1950s and the fight for power in Russia after the dictator's death. Are you laughing yet? It supposedly is satire which implies irony or sarcasm and the director/writer, Armando Iannucci, tries everything from the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges slapstick to insult comedy, chaos, no attempt at Russian accents having various accents ranging from Brooklyn to London but getting very few reactions from the audience.Iannucci is the writer of the much awarded HBO series ""Veep"" known for its comedy, irony, and sarcasm which it delivers with belly laughs, smiles, smirks, and humor while here he enlists 2 additional writers and the only smile/laugh I can remember is a crack about Grace Kelly!The cast consisting of Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, Simon Russell Beale, Adrian McLoughlin, Jeffrey Tambor, Olga Kurylenko, Rupert Friend, Jason Issacs, Paddy Considine among others deliver the expected performances with a little scenery chewing now and then.Enjoy seeing people shot in the head, brains taken out of a head after the scalp is cut back and 'fun' things like that? Can you go another day without knowing that most good doctors in Russia were killed and that Stalin had lists of people to be killed?Those answering 'yes' to any of the questions asked should probably go and see ""The Death of Stalin"".The only questions I am asking myself is have I lost my sense of humor as I've grown older or is funny and/or satire not what it was defined years ago?","The Death of Stalin",8281,4.1,2.1
"8282",3.5,"  QUIT STALINThe death of a ruthless dictator is often followed by total chaos, usually not of the funny variety. Except here. Here it's quite funny.Too early? Shouldn't be after all this was 1953, but the atrocities of the Soviet state were indeed, quite brutal. Thus the fine line balancing act begins. Armando Iannucci has bitten deep into political farce with Veep, The Thick of It, and In The Loop, but this is on another level altogether. As the masses are being rounded up and flippantly disposed of, the heads of state quibble nonsensically over tedious issues whilst plotting their personal power trips. Portraying eventual successor (spoiler) Nikita Krushev, Steve Buscemi is fabulously frazzled and slyly devious, but it is the truly vitriolic performance of Simon Russell Beale as the vile Lavrentiy Beria that steals the show. It's not easy to dip below the slimy levels of Stalin's henchmen, but Beale accomplishes the creepy feat with Shakespearian vigour. Too bad not all of the cast, especially the usually adept Jeffrey Tambor, can't keep up.To the film's credit, the great purge is not a mere backdrop to the Marx Brothers style frivolity, but a harsh companion. Torture and executions mix with all the bumbling. Risky, and perhaps the reason for steering the comedy away from physical to verbal. A bit of an unfilled tease with Monty Pythoner Michael Palin along for the ride, but so be it. Bet Vladimir Putin's not in any hurry to catch this one.- hipCRANK","The Death of Stalin",8282,4.1,0.6

"8296",3.5,"  This movie drives right up to the cliff of bad taste, and presses the accelerator. I really almost left, but then asked myself, could a similar movie be made about Hitler? Well, it has. The British are particularly good at Hitler/Nazi humor, and if I can laugh at Monty Python gags about that, I can sit through this.My discomfort was probably heightened at first by the unreality of all the mixed accents, British and American, high and lowbrow. Steve Buscemi sounds exactly like Steve Buscemi for instance, profanity and all. As long as we stick with the comical bickering between members of the Central Committee, this rolicks along, and is pretty funny. But those few scenes where Beria is trolling the halls of Lubyanka, and awful things are happening literally in the hallways around him, one starts to squirm again. The other reason to feel strange watching this is because Jeffrey Tambor has been thrown down the memory hole, except for this movie. I wonder if he was on the first draft of the poster, and then removed like the scratched out faces from historical photographs that appear during the end credits?Just when it seems the bickering has played out, in strides Jason Isaacs as Marshall Zhukov, to save the day by having the Red Army reassert its prominence over the NKVD. And we can all breathe a sigh of relief by the end, because the Beria that the Committee was joking with at the start of the film has been denounced in an entirely non-comic way and summarily executed, in a sequence that appears to be tacked on to make us feel less guilty for our earlier laughter. Good to see Michael Palin again too.","The Death of Stalin",8296,4.1,0.6
"8297",4.5,"  4.5* Over the top satire that may not be that far from the horrible truth. Still we laughed loudly but giggled nervously when it seemed a lot like current events. Good cast. I am old enough to know exactly what Khrushchev looked like so Buscemi remained Buscemi. That may have made it even funnier.","The Death of Stalin",8297,4.1,-0.4
"8298",4,"  Excellent comedy depicting the state of affairs of Russian politics after the death of Stalin and the power vacuum created. Simon Russell Beale is a standout in this great cast as Lavrenti Beria. The operatic soundtrack is exceptionally good and does what many modern films don't, has a thematic tune that is very memorable.","The Death of Stalin",8298,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8299",4,"  A devilishly funny dark comedy that skewers the lunacy of bureaucracy and the buffoonish behavior of the power hungry, set in the wake of the demise of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1953. The film's stellar ensemble cast, combined with a wickedly funny script and endless touches of high camp, make for uproariously funny viewing. Not all of the jokes work, and sometimes the film gets a little too political, but, these shortcomings aside, ""The Death of Stalin"" serves up loads of big laughs. Enjoy, comrade.","The Death of Stalin",8299,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8300",3,"  Quite an enjoyable but far from riveting watch, ""The Death Of Stalin"" is a witty satire boosted enormously by the delicious cast. Jeffrey Tambor steals the show, Steve Buscemi is Steve Buscemi and the dialogues and overall feel are definitely fun without entering farcical territory. On the other hand, the story can be a bit all over the place at times, seemingly out of focus, and it's a shame that actors such as Michael Palin and Paddy Considine had such small, and not that demanding, parts.","The Death of Stalin",8300,4.1,1.1
"8301",5,"  From the Director of In the Loop, a sardonic, funny take on the frightfulness of the Soviet Union. Brilliant acting, razor sharp writing, hints that this is how actual historical events actually played out while we're left to read official histories that gloss over the absurdity of it all.","The Death of Stalin",8301,4.1,-0.9
"8302",0.5,"  How it happened that so obviously nationalistic and low morally behaviour can appear in cinemas? Yesterday it was blacks in USA, then Jews in Europe, now Russians in Ukraine and England. Also, there are certain moral values in every nation - you are not supposed to laugh and dance on grave of other people tragic history. Not surprised low morally people are low professionals as well.

"8304",3.5,"  This isn't really a comedy--something that I'd been led to believe somehow before watching this movie, but a rather ruthless and unforgiving movie showing many disturbing things of those old times and ending in a rather gruesome way.

"8305",1,"  Let's start from ""In the Loop"": critics loved it, so I watched it, or should I say tried to watch it. After 30 minutes I had to stop. For me wasn't funny at all.

"8311",3,"  I didn't think it was possible but they actually went a little too far for me with the satire and black humor at times, joking about stuff that was just too ghastly. But most of it was okay and overall it was watchable. My rating is coming in below the consensus though - and not just because of the going-too-far thing. I just didn't find it as funny as it thinks it is. 6 out of 10.","The Death of Stalin",8311,4.1,1.1

"8313",4.5,"  A Phenomenal film that finds humor in a dark period of History. while the tragedies are never made fun of, the struggle for power over the soviet union is ripe with laughs.

"8333",5,"  If you were to think, the chaos that erupted in Stalin's Central Committee, immediately following his death, sounds like the perfect setting for a political satire, then you would be right. Armando Iannucci's film manages to take a distinctly dark period in history, and reenact it, with an immaculate balance of horror and comedy.It is a success in three key areas - firstly, the writing - despite how the trailer is cut, this is not in any way a farce. The comedy is subtle, with jokes taking time to hit their punchlines, often many scenes down the line, which makes the payoff all the more effective. The second element in it's accomplishment, does really counter-balance the first, in that the casting and performances are universally outstanding - it was a masterstroke to allow the actors to speak with their native accents, and not attempt to mock Russian ones, as it grants them freedom to hone their comedic interactions with each other and doesn't distract the audience unnecessarily.Finally, it is historically accurate - people were living in a climate of total fear, terrified of making any mistake under threat of imprisonment or execution. What the film does, is create this sense of dread, even among the powerful members of Stalin's central committee (who seem still terrified of him even after he is dead), and allow the nervous humour to play off of it. I think the best comedies always have this sense of trepidation balanced with the chuckles, and this is where the movie succeeds ultimately. You learn as you laugh, and although there are some distinctly dark moments throughout, the film never deviates from it's ultimate goal, of providing comic relief.","The Death of Stalin",8333,4.1,-0.9

The acting was superb across the board, although I don't understand why Jason Issac's was so heavily featured on the promotional material.The only cons I can think of is the speed, which felt both drawn out and rushed.

"8361",3.5,"  Armando Iannucci casts his dry sardonic eye over Russian politics this time with his adaptation of a French graphic novel depicting the power struggle that follows the death of Stalin and it is every bit as funny, absurd and horrifying as you would expect from the mind that brought us The Thick of It and Veep. As a fictitious reimagining with the British and American cast very wisely using their own accents (and thus avoiding any Russian caricatures here), there is more authenticity here than you'd expect and the result is an entertaining yet historical, and therefore quite educational, film that makes something that happened 60 odd years ago still political relevant and insightful today. Delicately balancing the humour with the horrendous reality that is living in Stalinist Russia, Iannucci's script is guillotine sharp and full of immensely quotable lines that are delivered by an inspired cast. The brilliant Steve Buscemi plays Khrushchev as a typically conniving Buscemi character while Jeffrey Tambor plays Stalin's deputy Malenkov as if Hank Kingsley has taken over The Larry Sanders Show. As for the British contingent, the group of comedic thespians is led by an indomitable Simon Russell Beale, the sublime Michael Palin who's perfectly utilised as the loyal Molotov; and to round it off, Jason Issacs's General Zhukov who storms on to the screen and totally takes over in the most arrogant and hilarious fashion.","The Death of Stalin",8361,4.1,0.6
"8362",0.5,"  I must be living in a parallel universe if anybody thinks this is remotely funny. It is genuinely the worst film I have wasted my money on in years. There's no attempt to establish audience empathy for any of the characters, no historical teaching, and the topic is just too dark for the feeble attempt at humour.","The Death of Stalin",8362,4.1,3.6
"8363",4,"  Loved it - dark themes but excellent acting by the whole cast - however standout performance from Jason Isaacs - brilliant!","The Death of Stalin",8363,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8364",3.5,"  It takes lots of skill to turn a big tragedy into great comedy","The Death of Stalin",8364,4.1,0.6
"8365",4,"  In the same fashion as films such as 'Dr. Strangelove' and Iannucci's own ""In the Loop"", 'The Death of Stalin' takes dark subject matter and turns it on it's head with slick dry comedy and a pitch black sense of humour. The film is held first and foremost by the brilliant comedic forces of it's actors. The talented performances in this film are first rate, each actor is remarkably skilled at bringing out the most humour without becoming too broad or over theatrical. Steve Buscemi gives one of his best performances in recent memory as the quick talking, weasely, but manipulative First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. Jason Isaacs plays Georgy Zhukov in an unexpected, but priceless performance as a masculine no-nonsense northerner.If you were expecting a historically and culturally accurate film, then you maybe confused as to why all the Russian characters have distinctive British and American accents, once you start to settle into the tone of the film you begin to understand why director Armando Iannucci has made this decision. In terms of tone it feels like a mix between 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'House of Cards' as odd as a mix that sounds it works excellently to create the absurd world that is satirising one not too dissimilar.The writing, performances and direction make 'The Death of Stalin' a film which whatever your political opinion maybe, laugh at the flawed and desperate nature of the characters, which we can all relate to in one way or another. While I don't have any real criticisms of the film, the film does not leave you on a high note, which is hard to complain about because of the subject matter, but for a comedy, despite all the laughs, the ending did make me feel quite low, however I think on multiple viewings I may grow to like it more.","The Death of Stalin",8365,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"8367",5,"  I studied Russian history and found that understanding helped me get a better grasp of the characters so ruthlessly exposed by Iannucci.If I would choose but one to read up on go for Lavrentiy Beria the Soviet Himmler who is even said to have worried Stalin.","The Death of Stalin",8367,4.1,-0.9
"8368",0.5,"  This film deserves a R18 as it is simply unwatchable for teens and kids alike.","The Death of Stalin",8368,4.1,3.6
"8369",3.5,"  It's positioned as a black comedy but for long stretches is just so grim it's not at all funny, with the laughs coming as momentary releases from the tension; which, you suspect, is truer to the history. The performances are great, especially SRB as the odious Beria.","The Death of Stalin",8369,4.1,0.6

"8372",4,"  The acting is superb and the comedy is stellar, but The Death of Stalin feels somewhat artificial at times - and suffers from some noticeable instances of amateur filmmaking, which is a shame considering how masterful many elements of the film are.","The Death of Stalin",8372,4.1,0.0999999999999996

"8374",3.5,"  I liked the fact that the characters were played as though they were running a Yorkshire village cricket team and yet they were running one of the world superpowers and perpetrating horrendous crimes. For me the humour at times was too close to the truth to be funny and it is the overall storyline that will stay with me.","The Death of Stalin",8374,4.1,0.6

"8378",3.5,"  Armando Iannucci has become famous for his fast talking, foul mouthed political comedies The Thick of It and Veep, and this one sounds like it could be another jolly jape in the aftermath of the death of Josef Stalin in 1950s communist Soviet Union. However, there is a black, black heart at the core of this film that never really lets you forget the atrocities going on during this brutal period. Simon Russell Beale, Steve Buscemi and Jeffery Tambor are three of Stalin?s inner circle jockeying for position after the Chairman?s death, while Michael Palin, Paul Whitehouse and Jason Isaacs also pop up with Andrea Riseborough and Rupert Friend as Stalin?s children. There is a blessed lack of fake Russian accents, instead the actors largely use their own - although Isaacs bluff Yorkshire is more Brian Glover than Lucius Malfoy. As expected with Iannucci, there are delightfully absurd moments and lots and lots of sweary but hilarious dialogue. There is also a lot of implied and onscreen violence - the grisly fate of a main character who one minute is taking, the next, shot In the head and set alight with his ashes shovelled up minutes later was very disturbing. There are several scenes of ordinary people led away and just shot point blank in a totally everyday way, that shows this is a time of extreme violence and oppression. However, against this backdrop, there are many hilarious moments and the comic timing of the cast is excellent. If you sometimes feel uncomfortable laughing at Malcolm Tucker?s profane rudeness or Selina Meyer?s incompetent bluntness, then you might be equally disconcerted at laughing while people live under threat of imminent death, depending on the word of a corrupt politician. On the other hand there are fart and wee jokes so there?s that","The Death of Stalin",8378,4.1,0.6
"8379",4,"  Really good. Funny and classic Iannucci darkness.","The Death of Stalin",8379,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8380",5,"  A brilliant film. This film manages to strike a balance between gripping drama and side-splitting comedy throughout; I think I actually cried twice with laughter near the beginning. All actors play their parts wonderfully and even though I was less familiar with Tambor as I was the other actors; he plays his ""lack of decision making character"" expertly. I am not a film critic and so I do not know what to say in professional terms other than please, PLEASE go and see this film. It is quite brilliant.","The Death of Stalin",8380,4.1,-0.9

"8384",4,"  By turns hilarious and horrifying.","The Death of Stalin",8384,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8385",4,"  Whoever thought of turning the succession crisis instigated by the death of Stalin into a farce deserves to be given a medal and then taken out and shot; the latter, of course, being the mandatory fate of anyone who peers above the crowd in any way. It's an absolutely astoundingly funny film, even though you watch the bodies pile up and realize it really shouldn't be.The basic facts of the film line up with what I remember reading about the end of Stalin's regime. What's changed is that the characters inhabiting the space have been turned into caricatures, bringing the absurdity of the situation to the fore and scoring big laughs off the cravenness, greed, and desperation of the committee members. There is no real lead, although Beria is the chief driving force for most of the film. He's played as the utterly loathsome man that he was, and he's probably the least comedic of the characters. It's hard to make his cruelty and lust anything but vile, so they mostly use him for any jokes involving a complete callous disregard for life. Better still, they pair him up with Jeffrey Tambour's Malenkov, who's nominally in charge now that Stalin's dead but hasn't a clue what to do. He's one of the more sympathetic of the bunch as, while he's vain and stupid and indecisive, he genuinely doesn't like playing murderous politics. He just wants to be important. He's the most overtly comic character as his confused bumblings and efforts to maintain respect often intensify the absurdity of the situation.Also vaguely sympathetic is Steve Buscemi's Khrushchev. Out of a bad bunch he genuinely is probably the best man they have to run the state. While they do poke some fun at his pretensions to being a great reformer, generally the humor with him comes from his straight man in over his head routine, and his efforts to maintain his dignity while maneuvering to oust Beria. While by the end he's shown he can be just as ruthless as the rest of them, you still kinda feel sorry for the guy.Most of the rest of the committee are just names. The only real exception is Molotov. Man, he's a riot. At first I couldn't see why they hired the great Michael Palin to play what was basically a dramatic role as an eternally serious and loyal party man. Then the plotting begins and his eyes just light up with glee as he joins in the purge. As he says, ""Stalin would be loving this."" The other characters are all outside the committee. Most are minor, such as the doctors rounded up off the streets since all the good doctors have already been executed. The director of Radio Moscow is a similar example, although he's the main window into the madness during the opening of the film when Stalin requests a nonexistent recording of the night's performance and they have to rush the audience back in and do it all again to keep him happy. More permanent are Stalin's children. His daughter's there for the committee members to alternately woo and offer protection, while the son's there to throw a spanner in the works of any plan that gets formulated through his childish instability. The last memorable role is Jason Isaacs as Marshall Zhukov. He's a lot of fun. No nonsense and instinctively violent, he's probably the only truly competent figure there. Aside from a certain vanity his main role is to puncture the ego balloons that everyone else carries around like a prize. His intensity is surprisingly funny.The whole film is about the incompetence and selfishness of those in power, although unlike most such films this one is about brutal autocrats. Mostly the brutality is played for laughs, as in the scene where Beria describes the horrible things he wants his men to do to the first two men on the list but then hands the rest to the last man and says he can deal with them however he wants (it's funnier in context). But the film never loses sight of the horrors these men were complicit in, even as it laughs at the way they jump in fear at every whim of the tyrants. The brutal ending as the plotting comes to fruition is played as straight as can be and still seems harsh, even after all the laughs that led up to it. The rest of the film is funny and more than a little disturbing, especially in an age where absurd autocrats are making a return everywhere. They need to be taken down a notch and we need to remember both how absurd such posturing is and how dangerous pathetic little power-hungry men can be.","The Death of Stalin",8385,4.1,0.0999999999999996
"8386",5,"  With a definite smell of python this film snakes its way between varying levels of satire, dark moments to get you sitting straight again and plenty of laughs that luckily are nicely spread and consistent through the whole film. Better than I had anticipated. And admit was a tad worried during the opening scene when Stalin first spoke. Soon got used the the accents though. Brilliant.","The Death of Stalin",8386,4.1,-0.9
"8387",4,"  The Death of Stalin is the blackest of black comedies from the directer who brought us Alan Partridge and In the Thick of It, Arnando Iannucci proceedings with stand out performances from Simon Russell Beale as the conniving and vile Lavrentiy Beria to Jason Isaac's who plays Georgy Zhukov, the Chief of the Soviet Army but with a brilliant Northern accent.It is completely bonkers, think Blackadder meets Curb Your Enthusiasm and you're part way there.

"8412",5,"  The Shape of Water is the only movie that can be compared to Paddington 2 in terms of completeness. That makes it easy to detect flaws in the completeness, and Sally Hawkins ' performance in Paddington 2 is very irritating to talk about more. Doug Jones's waterlogged acting was good, and Richard Jenkins's portrayal of the character and Zelda : Octavia Spencer. Personally, I think you should never miss this movie.","The Shape of Water",8412,4.2,-0.8

"8416",4,"  I wasn't even sure I liked the movie after I saw it, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I think it's worth a second watch for me. Guillermo del Toro does not dispoint in his visual-centric story telling. While there is a scene with a cat I dont think I can ever unsee, the twist on fairytales and monster stories where (spoiler) man is the biggest monster of all is refreshing. For those who were upset by the ending of Pans Labyrinth, they may find this ambiguous ending to be more likely happy, while up for interpretation. Come for the beautiful visuals, stay for the representations of minorities (including black, gay, mute and female characters) in their fight against the machine.","The Shape of Water",8416,4.2,0.2

"8421",4,"  Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water is a beautifully crafted film about friendship, love, sacrifice and acceptance. Unfortunately, it constantly reminded me of a specific Simpsons episode that dealt with Troy McClure and his ""romantic abnormality"". Don't get me wrong, this is a terrific movie filled with great performances, gorgeous production values, and a wonderfully dark sense of humour...I just kept hearing Phil Hartman's voice in my head the entire time. Not everything in the movie works, but I don't think any of it would've worked unless Guillermo Del Toro was in complete creative control. It's essentially his twisted take on Beauty and the Beast, just replace the beast with the creature from the black lagoon. The budding romance between Sally Hawkins' mute Eliza and the God-like amphibian man may be at the forefront, but it was the friendship between Eliza and her neighbour, played by Richard Jenkins, that was the highlight of the film for me. Then there's poor Michael Shannon, relegated to playing the same one-dimensional bad guy over and over again...although Del Toro does give his character a hilariously morbid gag about his fingers slowly rotting off. It's this kind of dark humour sprinkled throughout the movie that made me enjoy it that much more. The Shape of Water is well acted, emotionally engaging, surprising, funny, and very, very weird. It still makes me laugh that a movie about fish sex won best picture.","The Shape of Water",8421,4.2,0.2
"8422",2,"  Dull as dishwater. Pretty to watch at the start but ends up as a ball of nothing, with authenticity issues galore. You won't care about any of them by the end.","The Shape of Water",8422,4.2,2.2

Love is not judgemental, and this film leaves you with an ache in your chest.","The Shape of Water",8424,4.2,0.2
"8425",3,"  This is a weird movie, a sort of cross between Splash and Beauty and the Beast. The American paranoia of the 1950s and 1960s is clearly demonstrated. Some of the characters are a rather disturbing reflection of what appears to be resident in the Trump White House. The violence was disturbing, but the passion of the actors was very emotional.","The Shape of Water",8425,4.2,1.2
"8426",2,"  Boring, poorly paced, and wholly unremarkable.","The Shape of Water",8426,4.2,2.2

"8428",1.5,"  Terrible movie. There were way too many parts that made no sense whatsoever. Poor pacing, generic love story, too long by about an hour for the story told, didn't evoke any real emotions. Literally every white man is evil except the communist? Can you shove the political agenda any further into my face? How the heck did this even get nominated????","The Shape of Water",8428,4.2,2.7

"8436",5,"  Del Toro is back on form with this film. Is it a monster film, a cold war film, a prisoner breakout film?

"8441",5,"  I absolutely loved this movie. The soundtrack as well as the visuals were, as expected from Del Toro, beautiful. I went into the movie not knowing it was one of his movies, but later I was not suprised in the least. Stylistically it was very similar to Pan's Labyrinth. Those two movies, even if very different story wise, conveyed a similar kind of feeling. If you liked one of them, I'm certain you'll like the other as well. I can understand that some might found it a tad too long but I didn't feel that a single scene wasn't necessary for the story as a whole. Which is why for me it's one of the best movies that came out in 2017.","The Shape of Water",8441,4.2,-0.8

"8444",1.5,"  This film made interesting choices, and was unique in itself, but it was very uncomfortable to watch, especially because one of the first things we see our main character do in their morning routine, it masturbate in the bathtub. The film was very different, but the plot was very predictable, and it was pretty obvious the entire time nothing bad was going to happen and she was going to end up with the creature from the Black Lagoon in the end, but it what didn't make since to me, is that the scratches on her neck turned into gills and she ended up being able to breah under water. I'd honestly like to see a weird love story like this not have the most strange but predictable ending ever and not end up with a ""happily ever after"". I'd say, if you're thinking about buying/renting this if you missed it in theatres, just pass on it. It's basically soft-core Creature of the Black Lagoon porn (it's almost like a fanfiction more than a movie).","The Shape of Water",8444,4.2,2.7

"8455",0.5,"  This movie was only duller the second time around. I personally find the characters completely 2 dimensional good/bad.The lack of grey makes this movie dull and uninteresting.

"8456",4,"  In the era of the paranoid 1960's, Elisia (Sally Hawkins), a mute cleaner working at a government laboratory, befriends a strange fish-monster (Doug Jones) held captive there. When the monster's life is threatened by a hostile agent (Michael Shannon), Elisia, along with her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and a sympathetic Russian scientist (Michael Stuhlbarg) bring the creature to her home, where she starts to develop stronger feelings for the lonely beast....Taking inspiration from Universal's Creature from the Black Lagoon along with themes from some of his other films such as Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, Guillermo Del Toro's latest film is a haunting, yet visually stunning Beauty and the Beast tale that brings the career of one of the best fantasy directors out there back to his roots in the dark fantasy genre in the vein of Cronos and The Devil's Backbone.Much like how Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth used the setting of the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain as a way integrating fantasy with reality, The Shape of Water uses the Cold War setting to it's full advantage in it's themes within the main narrative of Elisia and the Monster facing antagonists who are motivated by fear of anything that isn't the perfect image of a ""proper"" American with the characters of Giles and an African-American cleaner named Zelda (Octavia Spencer) having to undergo their own subplots of being rejected by society with the former being homosexual and the latter not being white.Although some people may find the fact that Del Toro regular, Doug Jones is playing another intelligent fish-monster after previously playing a similar creature Abe Sapain in the Hellboy films slightly amusing, both he and Sally Hawkins have a heartwarming romantic arc as shown in several sequences where they bond over sign language, even if it's a bit less interesting than the ones featured in those films.Overall, The Shape of Water is another great fantasy epic from Guillermo Del Toro that should satisfy both his fans and for anyone looking for a late Valentine's Day film that offers something that better, down where it's wetter, under the sea.","The Shape of Water",8456,4.2,0.2
"8457",4,"  Hook, Line and SinkerDel Toro's unique Oscar winning tour de force confirms the Mexican as the greatest fantasy film maker alive. Visually sumptuous, the film boasts great performances throughout. The story is compelling and involving and deserves close attention.On the surface, it is an unlikely love story between a deaf mute cleaning woman and a captured creature that lived in the Amazon - so much, so Creature of the Black Lagoon. What drives this film is hatred of men - misandry - and a rejection of the 'patriarchy' in no uncertain terms. Hence, it won Best Picture in the year of MeToo.While this is involving it is also undermining. No heterosexual male character is remotely admirable - the Frankenstein lookalike Michael Shannon, who plays the creature's persecutor, the General, even the black cleaning woman's husband - all come in for narrative vitriol. The only male characters to be portrayed as humans are the gay artist neighbour (Jenkins) and the communist spy (Stuhlbarg). It is the women who are virtuous and triumphant - the mute cleaning woman (Hawkins), her buddy (Spencer), who conspire to save the creature from being murdered and cut up by setting him free to return to the sea.So the fantasy is really similar to Pan's Labyrinth - a tale of misandry, in which the patriarchy surpasses women, gays and nature to control, dominate and even, kill it. It plays to the current feminist narrative with relish, the story turning ghoulish and bloody to make the points unmistakable. It is stil a great film - original, brilliantly written, directed and performed. But what underlines the story cannot be glossed over or excused. It is a hate letter to the imagined patriarchy and to heterosexual men. Period.","The Shape of Water",8457,4.2,0.2
"8458",4,"  Screwing with amphibians for dummiesTHE SHAPE OF WATERTruly original movies, or at least the utter feeling of novelty when watching a film is very hard to come by. Guillermo del Toro's proves himself again as one of this generation's most visionary filmmakers constructing a film that feels as refreshing as a swim in the lake*. This movie is one of the most fascinatingly intelligent of this year, it's a daring and historic endeavour in the movie industry. And look, it isn't by chance that this movie has flushed away* the competition when it comes to Oscar noms, the film is the most lavishing technical masterpiece of this year: the resplendent production design is pushed to perfection, building not only a space that is so removed from us both chronologically and visually, that it's exaggerated to create a distinct world where such a creature is justifiable; the French-inspired score by Desplat who compliments the story making them indissociable; the murky and unwonted cinematography with bold stylistic/ colour choices which makes every shot a underwater dream; and the impeccable sound design. However, I don't agree with the editing nom as I find that it's the movie's biggest blemish because it's moderately overcut, there are many tone shifts across scenes where there should be none and the way that conflict is carried out throughout the runtime is not at all balanced. It's also lacking way more care when to spend time with our characters to develop their relationship to the longest extent (instead of jumping over some days at a time). Conversely, the Academy failed to nominate one of the best visual effects of the year, striking a dashing balance between practical and digital effects. When they're on full display, you don't doubt the creature's credibility and when they're not so flashy, you can't even notice their presence and that's what that craft is all about. It also features immensely successful actor-character pairings as Michael Shannon taps again into his ability to play a sociopath creating a menacing antagonist and Richard Jenkins serving as the protagonist's partner in crime alongside Octavia Spencer who doubles as a comic relief. Of course, Sally Hawkins is mouth-watering* in her portrayal of a mute woman who is not tamed by her disability but rather strength by it. She complements the quiet nature of the monster who, like her, can't talk, reinforcing that communication can be dissociable from speech and does not imply it, which in turn allows the director to adhere to one of cinema's biggest lessons: show, not tell. By giving the mute woman the spotlight and by placing the black woman and gay man as the voices of conscience that can actually talk, del Toro gives expression to the voiceless, those fish out of water* who are pushed away by society and are thought to be inferior. That contributes and is interleaved with the movie's theme of unconditional love, a love that disregards the societal anger towards a different skin tone or species, that fear of the other, of what we don't understand which continues to contaminate the world today. The creature is the only one who sees Elisa despite of her disability. Also, Elisa is treated as an independent and highly intelligent woman who is unapologetically shown masturbating (which is rare) and shifts the role of damsel, being the one who saves her lover. All that makes the movie unimpeachable from an ideological point of view but it's so much more than that. Del Toro wears its references crystal clear and his love for misunderstood monsters from his childhood is evident (he wants to rewrite the faith of the creature of the Black Lagoon). It's a love letter to Classic Hollywood films combining the ideas of B horror movies with the grace of Golden Age musicals. It's the most musical-like film of the year without even being a musical as it borrows the essence of Astaire and Kelly's movements to imprint the film with a dream-like fluidity. At the end of the day, this adult fairly tale is one of the most captivating films of the year, it's an all-inclusive, female-empowering musical feature that isn't shy on showing sexuality or violence. A fascinating film to watch and a kiss on a monster's slimy cheek. *Warning: FrameReel apologizes for the overuse of bad water-related puns","The Shape of Water",8458,4.2,0.2
"8459",3,"  Pic's initial set-up discloses mediocre treatment given to a unique premise - a regulation-issue U.S military lab receives a unique wild creature captured from the depths of South America's jungles. Unlike many amphibians, it is humanoid, with a bipedal upright posture and a face with eyes and lips, with the crucial factor being its breathing organs that respire both in air and water. With the scientists unable to fully analyze its unique physiology, the military hits upon the brilliant idea of killing the creature by vivisection so that its secrets will be finally laid bare. In this barbaric equation, where's the relief ? It comes in the form of Elisa Esposito - the facility's petite cleaning woman, who is mute. She is not a physical beauty but there is a gentleness in her demeanour that is like a calming surf. This quietly angelic and elegant essence is exquisitely conveyed by Sally Hawkins. Early on, we see her naked body descending into the bath-tub and I later wondered what was the purpose of this element of nudity apart from its elemental appeal. Presumably, Del Toro's idea is to show her as she is, with no secrets at all , an uncorrupted transparent presence. She takes a liking to the aquatic humanoid and the feeling turns reciprocal. They are both outsiders , and yes this is a movie that also bows its gills to the plight of the gay, and the African-American. That admirable sentiment should be handled delicately of course, with artful amplification without shouting it from the rooftops, but Del Toro is unable to develop that poignant dynamic to its acme. There are some exquiste whispers to this effect though, as the aged Giles (an excellent Richard Jenkins looking, sounding and emoting very much like an aged Walter White) sits beside a bath-tub and spills his heart out to his partially comprehending one-off counterpart.The picture is a success on many fronts till the half-way point, and after that while its retains its narrative sensibility, the imagination mucks around on the ocean bed, not finding much to vary the palette. Elisa takes a very bold decision ( cf. the govt.-alleged activity of Wikus van de Merwe of 'District 9' ) and her decision one fine evening to 'run the tap' flows into a gloriously wreckless beauty of a scene. The movie is not coy about what our unshackled Amphibian Man can be, and his encounter with a cat fully justifies a scream. Yes, there are some fantasy touches of what he can do , but it pales in comparison to what Spielberg achieved when he sets Agatha and John loose in a mall in ""Minority Report"". The biggest weak link is the villain - Colonel Strickland competently enacted by William Shannon. For me it is impossible to see him without remembering ""Jaws"" - the giant-like man of craggy-boulder, scary face played by Richard Kiel as the ultimate villain in some Bond movies. Del Toro might very well have been looking to channel this scary-giant effect when he used Shannon for the role. It is worth noting how both the monsters, the one inside the water and the one outside, take a liking toward the simple and docile lady in their perimeter. Shannon though has a very limited brief - to act like an alpha prick with everyone, to bloodily beat up the Ambhibian Man, and to have brutally mechanistic sex with this wife. The role becomes straight-jacketingly two-dimensional and if Shannon tried to improvise some much needed dual shades, it either doesn't come through at all or Del Toro quashes it.

"8466",3.5,"  Of all the Best Picture nominees of 2017, I was the most excited to see this movie, and was thus the most disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It's good, yes, but not nearly up to the caliber of Del Toro's incredible ""Pan's Labyrinth"". It's a lovely little fable about two outsiders who find each other and fall in love against all odds, and it's all very sweet. But honestly, this story could just as easily been told as a Disney animated film. The story is unoriginal and the characterizations are one dimensional. Everyone in the movie is either a really good and moral person or a raving sociopath (I'm looking at you, Michael Shannon! But oh, doesn't he always play that raving sociopath role to perfection?). It's all very basic and predictable. I did love the imagery - it's a romance that looks like a horror movie, and it really worked for the story (all the direct references to ""green"" were a little much though... yes, we get it, the movie is green). But at its core, it's a parable about ""otherness"" in a world in which you do not belong, and the loneliness that this breeds. It's sad, but sweet at the same time. But there are too many eye-rolling moments for me to call this one of the best films of the year.","The Shape of Water",8466,4.2,0.7
"8467",3.5,"  MILD SPOILERS This is a tough one. A genuinely twisted love affair (as you would expect from Del Toro) that is beautifully shot. However I had two problems with it, and the first one is that the music that is chosen seems to be at odds with the setting. I'ts 1950's America and a lot of the backing is French style mournful/playful accordion that is better suited to Amelie (or if you're English then it would be 'Allo 'Allo). It just really jarred with what I saw onscreen and actually detracted from the tension/romance etc.The second problem that I had was the fact that all mean (except the gay character) are portrayed as total psychos/idiots. Except for a gay character and a communist spy. The culture of the USA in the 50s is shown as being brutal and uncaring. And of course, the women are the only ones with any sense whatsoever. Normally I don't care about this stuff but it seemed exceptionally heavy handed in this case and didn't really serve the plot in any way. Anyway, that is more of an indepth cultural analysis. It's a good film but don't expect it to reach the heights of Pan's Labyrinth. I suspect the Oscars that it received may well be because of the more in depth analysis that I have mentioned here, rather than the strength of the film itself!","The Shape of Water",8467,4.2,0.7
"8468",4,"  While the premise of bringing back a classic movie monster for an interesting new story is a brilliant idea, it did not translate as well onto the screen. It's story is underwhelming, riddled with plot holes and at times is preachy with its overplayed themes of the struggles of America's disenfranchised in the 60's. Nonetheless it is a technical masterpiece from its gorgeously detailed costumes and sets to its unique soundtrack and ingenious cinematography. Despite its style over substance problem it still retains a sort of weird charm that makes it absolutely worth it to see.","The Shape of Water",8468,4.2,0.2
"8469",1.5,"  I'm not going to lie, I skimmed through it. I didn't even stay for the ending. The plot, the characters, and the romance were so badly constructed, it was torture. Only the cinematography (though the coloring could have looked less sickly with a little bit more orange or coral) and the premise were interesting and for those, I am going to give it 1 star. The acting was ok, so here is another 1/2 star. I recommend you to do something better with your free time (e.g. watch Pan's Labyrinth).","The Shape of Water",8469,4.2,2.7

"8482",3,"  While being masterfully crafted and visually flawless, The Shape Of Water lacks a compelling narrative and dynamic characters. The crude sex scenes served as a cheap and easy way to portray emotions and attributes which could have been depicted much more artistically and tastefully. At times, I was drawn in by the outstanding performances and visual effects. At other times, I was dismayed by the silliness of it all. In addition, I thought the final scenes too closely resembled Del Toro's previous work Pan's Labyrinth. If you're interested in seeing what all the hype is about, give it a watch.

"8483",4,"  The movie ""Shape of Water"" is about a mute and awkward woman, Elisa, who works at a high-security government laboratory where she meets a strange sea creature. The creature was captured from a South American river and is human and fish like. Those at the government are studying and experimenting on it.The Creature is treated poorly by most of the people at the lab, but especially by the lead villain, a guy named Richard. Elisa, on the other hand, treats the creature as a friend, feeding him, trying to do things to make him happy, and this leads to her eventually falling in love with him. The creature is very special as you will notice in the last scene of the movie. Elisa is also very special so the ending was very appropriate.Even though Elisa does not speak a word in the movie the actress who played the part, Sally Hawkins, did a wonderful job of giving us so much emotion and feeling that it didn't matter.

Sally Hawkins as the mute central character puts in a stunning performance and is matched every step of the way by the largely underrated Doug Jones who's physical performance as the Amphibian Man is every bit as raw and emotional as the human characters. The Cold War story line of a Russian spy in the ranks detracts from the core of the film and had it been removed, the story would have played out in exactly the same way, begging the question of why it was there in the first place.

Compare it to Coco...yeah I'm a gringo, but I learned a lot about and discovered new respect for the Day of the Dead ritual. The concept of the remember me song and being forgotten was amazing. So many links in that chain. Unpredictability. The Shape of Water didn't hold a candle to it. I was crying for the last 15 minutes of Coco.

But, and it's a big one ... as with so many movies today it is just TOO long. They could have cut 30 minutes and it would have lost nothing. In fact, it would have probably been a better, tighter story arc. SPOILER ALERT - as pointed out by my brother, who I watched this with, they keep the creature ""captive"" in Elisa's apartment for way too long on the thin pretext they need to wait for rain. Why couldn't they just drive down to the ocean?! Worth seeing, but not as good as some of del Toro's other works.PS For what it's worth, the love story element is the mirror opposite of the one in the movie ""Dagon"", a take on Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" - a thrilling, weird, horror flick well worth seeing.","The Shape of Water",8502,4.2,0.7

"8506",2.5,"  *SPOILERS*VISUALLY, a strikingly beautiful and stunning pastiche of better films. A painfully obvious direct ripoff and patchwork reassembly of SPLASH and the Dutch short film THE SPACE BETWEEN US. Even the title of the short film is perfectly echoed in one of the feature film's most iconic shots. Even the recurring verdant sets clearly derivative of Edward Hopper's ""The Nighthawks"", which I kept expecting to see as an Easter egg on a wall. Unfortunately, this flagrant copy breaks no new ground in terms of storytelling. The plot feel and characterization are remarkably shallow. The underlying MESSAGE, strongly anti-white, anti-capitalist, and anti-Christian. The utterly detestable Michael Shannon plays the villain, who is painstakingly painted as a married white Christian male. We got it. And as a cheat, a hypocrite, a racist, a sadist, a misogynist, and a rapey sexual pervert. He despises women, even as he uses them only for sexual gratification and menial labor. He commits anti-Christian acts at every turn whilst paying lip service to God. He is so racist that even his blackening, gangrenous fingers offend him so much he rips them off his body. THEMATICALLY, strong arcs of bestiality and homosexuality complete the anti-Christian mix. Even the mechanism of copulation between fish-man and human-fish-woman was carefully described to make sure we couldn't miss it. A gratuitous masturbation scene was thrown in, presumably to make us understand Sally Hawkins' character was lonely and rejected. We got it. The pro-Communist theme completed by the hero of the film being a Russian communist spy. The American military depicted as crude, unthinking fascists bent on jingoism and evil-doing. The lonely outcasts of society were showcased and denigrated aplenty, with a particularly gruesome mockery of mute persons.STRUCTURALLY, a shot-for-shot ripoff of the aforementioned films, with storyboards you could lay on top of each other and identically trace. The twist was obvious from the beginning, and the entire film very predictable.ACTING was top shelf. Octavia Spencer was her typical likeable and comedic self and did a very fine job. Sally Hawkins and the rest of the cast were also excellent.Highly overrated, with the thefts and warts overlooked due to the trending politically correct anti-American and anti-Christian themes, and other SJW-ish factors. It would be far more enjoyable to one who is blind to, or agrees with its messages, and who has never seen SPLASH and doesn't know about the blatant theft from the short film.

"8512",5,"  Guillermo del Toro's career to date has produced fantasy movies with a dark, oddball quality that makes him a unique figure at the moment. The Shape of Water continues this style and is recognisably his movie but is, I think at least, the sweetest and most heartwarming of his works to date. Yes, there are still some grim scenes that made me squirm uncomfortably in my seat but the overall feel I left with was of a magical and tender story and a perfectly crafted piece of cinema. Sally Hawkins has a smile that could melt the iciest heart and is simply charming as the dumb cleaning lady Eliza, who falls in love with an amphibious creature that is being studied in a military laboratory. The story is populated by a number of characters who are ostracised by the 1960s American society in which the story unfolds. A particular delight is Octavia Spencer as Zelda, Eliza's co-worker who often acts as her interpreter. This is a touching and heartwarming allegory which is very deserving of all the praise and awards it has gathered over the past few months since it was released. I am sure this will become a firm favourite for years to come.","The Shape of Water",8512,4.2,-0.8

It's an indie that borders on B-movie territory, yet is populated by Hollywood elite actors, and helmed by idiosyncratic director Guillermo Del Toro. What's not to like? Everything, or nothing.

"8570",4.5,"  Whenever Guillermo del Toro is working on dark fantasy films, that is like the one thing I want to see more out of him. But that's not me saying that fantasy is the only thing he's good at. I enjoyed his action blockbuster films, (such as the ""Hellboy"" movies and 2013's ""Pacific Rim""). I never got the chance to see his last movie, ""Crimson Peak,"" (which many people are considering it as del Toro's disappointing film). Well, actually, the only least movie he has ever made, in my opinion, was ""Mimic."" I never find his plot and characters of ""Mimic"" to be very interesting, but I realized that del Toro wasn't at all impressed with it either, due to the fact that the Weinstein Company didn't appreciate his vision. Now, he comes up with another dark fantasy film called ""The Shape of Water,"" and the first thing I can say about it is that this is easily his best film since his masterpiece, ""Pan's Labyrinth.""Set in the Cold-War era, Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute, lonely janitor who works at a secret laboratory, and spends her time with her gay neighbor and artist, Giles (Richard Jenkins), whenever she's not working. One day, her life started to change when she and her co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), have discovered a captured creature (Doug Jones) in the lab. Elisa becomes friends with the creature, but as far as their friendship goes, the two of them starts falling in love with each other.Many people were thinking to themselves that this film must be a spinoff to ""Hellboy,"" based on how the creature looked very similar to Abe Sapien. But keep in mind, I knew, right before I saw this movie, that this was pretty much another dark fantasy film by Guillermo del Toro. The concept of the film is heavily inspired by ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" but besides that film, there are also many things to explore in ""The Shape of Water."" It's very easy to see the similarities between this film and ""Pan's labyrinth."" It also features a lot of biblical references and many other classic films, (which I don't want to get into any details about it because I do feel like it'd be me giving away the film). For all of its themes, elements, and the entire cast, this film manages to be so well done because of those things. Recognizing her from movies like ""Happy-Go-Lucky,"" (which was the film she won a Golden Globe for her role), Sally Hawkins's portrayal as Elisa is memorizing. The way how we see her communicating through sign language and the way how she expresses her emotions for herself is undeniably amazing. Even though I like the relationship between Elisa and the creature, I actually like the friendship between her and Giles more. Like the friendship between Ofelia and Mercedes in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" that's exactly what I feel about their friendship in ""The Shape of Water."" Richard Jenkins delivers a warm, gentle performance as Giles, and he and Sally Hawkins deserve to be praised for what they've done in the film.I wouldn't say that Michael Shannon's character, Colonel Strickland, is about as unsettling as Captain Vidal in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but like some of his best performances, he is devilish good when it comes to playing an antagonist quite like this one. Another performance that everyone's been praising is Octavia Spencer, (better known from ""The Help"" and ""Hidden Figures). At first, I never see anything special about her character, but as time goes on, I started to see something out of her character, (which, again, that'd be me giving away the film). Michael Stuhlbarg does a fine job as a scientist who's secretly a soviet spy. He's very similar to Dr. Ferreiro in ""Pan's Labyrinth.""The only input I have with ""The Shape of Water"" is the third act. While it ends on a sweet note, I've found it to be a little too rushed for me. But as much as I love ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" there is so much great imagination that I can't ignore. My full opinion: 9.3/10.","The Shape of Water",8570,4.2,-0.3
"8571",4,"  An absolutely stunning film, featuring beautiful photography, excellent production design and a great soundtrack. The entire cast is phenomenal and the story itself is a brilliant piece of screenwriting in terms of themes, characters and plot. It's a wonderfully resonant movie and a completely immersive experience: taut and relaxing, real and surreal, unsettling and sweet, it's the definition of memorable.","The Shape of Water",8571,4.2,0.2
"8572",0.5,"  No..just no. This movie is proof that fredom of expression and speach wil be banned in the not to distent future. Leftwing propaganda is the only way i can difine this abomination.","The Shape of Water",8572,4.2,3.7
"8573",3,"  This movie is an interesting attempt to mingle disparate genres: a fantasy creature and fairy-tale-love story arc, cold-war intrigue, and a modern take on the faults of early 1960s white all-americanism. The result is an interesting blend of tropes, but, unfortunately, for me it lacked the feeling of having created something really novel through the effort. Oh well, the plot is still nicely woven together and the performances are good.","The Shape of Water",8573,4.2,1.2
"8574",1.5,"  Overrated for sure. This beat Dunkirk for best picture at the Oscars? Too much a political agenda at the awards show. Okay, I have no problem with putting a message in a film so long as the movie is entertaining and watchable. While sets, music, costumes and acting were good, Del Toro usually does a better job of story-telling. So much was predictable with this film and so much is wrong! Del Toro takes many swipes at the ""bad guys"" but delivers no knock out punch as this film just doesn't work. Again Del Torno makes the man in unifom the bad guy. Forget what such people did in two world wars to protect the rest of civilization and keep totlitarianism away, Hollywood is so busy trashing ""old ways"" they neglect the real monsters circling outside the walls. Del Toro takes a Lovecraftain Dagon monster and recasts him as something loveable but the romance is built up with little substance (or even emotion) behind it. The two ""oppressed lovers"" go though an adventure that will likely please malcontents everywhere but the story is too weak to truly make it enjoyable. I agree with other critics - it is a poor remake of the the movie Splash.","The Shape of Water",8574,4.2,2.7

"8576",1,"  Too much nudity/porn-ish references. This movie could have been a lot better without hte nudity and violence. And they wonder why kids shoot up schools when this is the kind of crap Hollyweird feeds them. The actress was great (prefer her NOT to be naked). Too much digital crap. Makes me wish for the movies from the 40s and 50s.","The Shape of Water",8576,4.2,3.2
"8577",3,"  This is a movie that I appreciated more than I liked. The love story between a mute woman and a fish god is beautifully directed and acted. As the mute woman, Sally Hawkins makes melancholy beautiful. Octavia Spencer, as her best friend, is a stand-in for the audience and a welcome dose of comic relief. All the elements are present. But, and it's a big but, it doesn't add up in the long run. The chemistry between Hawkins and the fish just isn't there--the reason for the romance is that ""he doesn't see she is broken,"" not the greatest reason for love. And the graphic sex scenes and violence pulls you out of the elegant visual feast on display. One sex scene has a naked Hawkins getting it on with the fish while the bathroom fills with water to the ceiling from an overflowing tub. This simply is impossible and requires an epic suspension of disbelief. Not the sex part--that a overflowing tub could make a bathroom into an aquarium. And the side story with the great Michael Stuhlbarg makes zero sense. I had high hopes going into the film and give it the rating I did based on degree of difficulty, but I recommend it with very strong reservations.","The Shape of Water",8577,4.2,1.2

Its a dark romantic film I can tell you that but its a beautiful dark romantic film with a story that is so poetic and artistic that it will engage you plus I love the visuals in the film very beautiful and the design of the creature very well done I like that. The characters in the film are very likable like zelda and of course Elisa she remains me like Ofelia in Pan's labyrinth but a grown up version of herself which is awesome. Plus I love the whole 1960's look in the film which is very cool and I like that in movies now that is how you make a good film. Overall The shape of water is a beautiful dark romantic and also a artistic film like no other with amazing visuals, lovable characters, and a well crafted and beautiful dark story that is truly amazing and magical and I love that sooo much. Well done Guillermo del Toro you made yet again a beautiful and a very dark romantic and also a artistic film that is truly a masterpiece of a film and you my friend are a awesome film maker and this film I really love it and I will say it again, a fucking masterpiece.

"8597",3,"  This movie is all the rage in the Oscars. So I give it a watch. To me its ...Meh... The premise is not too bad and mood is definable grimy Del Toro style. But I found the story plot BORING. you know whats going to happen so basically when you are watching the flick its just like going thru the motion. So yeah once again the so called professional critics are fawning over something mediocre..","The Shape of Water",8597,4.2,1.2

"8600",5,"  Film of the year! 2017 has given us brilliant coming of age stories like Lady Bird or horror satire like Get Out. We got scares and coming of age stories in It, now Guillermo del Toro enchants the heart with his romantic horror masterpiece The Shape of Water.Sally Hawkins is magnificent as the mute maid Eliza. You will fall in love with her and empathize with her terrible longing and heartfelt desires. Hawkins deserves the Oscar for leading actress for her performance.Doug Jones is captivating as the water creature, perceptive in his movements and facial signals. He brilliantly matches Hawkins' subtle acting. Their faces, mouths, eyes, and hand movements engage you without words.Michael Shannon delivers the villainous performance of a lifetime as the terrifying, yet thrillingly shrewd government agent. You realize he is the true monster of this fairy tale.Alexandre Desplat's score will delight your eyes with gentle and rousing classical music that perfectly fits the tone of the film. It's swells enchant with sonic magic and the subtle music cues parallel the passionate emotions on screen.Guillermo del Toro has surpassed the majesty and mystique of his previous landmark in horror film, Pan's Labyrinth, in spectacular fashion. He should be proud of crafting a movie that is simultaneously, gorgeous to gaze upon, and thrilling to witness. Go see The Shape of Water in theaters immediately! You have never had a cinematic experience quite like this film.","The Shape of Water",8600,4.2,-0.8
"8601",5,"  My husband and our two dearest friends watched this movie last night. The results split right down gender lines. The two women loved it and the two men not so much. Although very predictable, it was a beautiful, and very original love story. I would highly recommend it.","The Shape of Water",8601,4.2,-0.8
"8602",0.5,"  I find extremely disturbing that this movie got nominated and won as best picture from movie industry professionals. the whole movie is a copy-paste from at least ten other successful movies that are impossible to miss. i find unacceptable from a director like del toro to paste together pieces of other movies to create a new one and that no one cries scandal.","The Shape of Water",8602,4.2,3.7
"8603",4,"  This movie actually felt more original then most movies these days. Held my interest. I loved how the main character didn't even have to speak. I liked how it took place in the 60's. Visually I liked the film, over all I enjoyed it a lot more then I thought I would.","The Shape of Water",8603,4.2,0.2
"8604",1,"  Life draining crap of a movie, if you thought that ""The English patient"" was a complete soul sucking waste of your finite time on earth you will feel the same about this one.","The Shape of Water",8604,4.2,3.2
"8605",0.5,"  The Shape Of Water...from a director I used to respect and like, a complete garbage of a white saviour film masquerading as a liberal artsy piece...AKA how to try and fail to be Avatar/ET. Every single character in this film is a stereotype - written from the perspective of a straight white man trying and failing to portray the voice of the oppressed. We have caricatures at every turn - from the deliberately unempowered and literally voiceless, doe-eyed female Latino cleaner Eliza who feels a desperate need to become a saviour but who ends up getting saved, to the magical negro trope in Zelda, to the un-empathetic and law abiding male in her husband, to the evil Caucasian American Gestapo man who rapes his wife, who's only there to make dinner, look pretty and get raped (a rape that's there as a trope, for which there is no consequence), to the 'savage' from the rainforest that is a literal depiction of a white supremacist colonial mindset of the oppressed, needing to be rescued, to the gay neighbour ('the gay sidekick') who suddenly decides to help save a creature he's never seen before because he's rejected by a man in a diner, to the moustache twirling Russians, to the overt female nudity and objectification for which there is no male counterpart. Eliza is such a blank canvas of a personality with no backstory besides being an orphan that her only desire and purpose in this film is to save the 'man' she loves...because obviously female leads are only really concerned with love and men. The experience of oppression is nuanced and varies from person to person - being female or gay, or black, are not the same thing and it's simplistic to bulk every oppressed caricature in the film and gang them up against a cardboard cut-out of an evil white man. Like Three Billboards, a Hollywood wet dream and a shit show of lazy, ignorant stereotypes that does more damage than good.","The Shape of Water",8605,4.2,3.7
"8606",3,"  The good - production design, camerawork - is sadly outweighed by the bad - a treacly sentimentality and ludicrous plot. It's true I'm not a fan of Del Toro and at least this isn't Pacific Rim, but it's outrageous that this lengthy hybrid of ET and a fifties Norman Wisdom filler beat Phantom Thread and Three Billboards to Best Picture. If you enjoyed Lassie you'll love this.","The Shape of Water",8606,4.2,1.2
"8607",2,"  Very disappointed with this film. I really had high hopes. I heard so many great things about it. The cinematography was good. I just found it really boring. Very formulaic. I've never really been a fan of Guillermo del Toro anyway. His movies are sometimes pretty to look at but have very little substance. I thought this one might be different but I was wrong. I really don't understand the hype on this one.","The Shape of Water",8607,4.2,2.2
"8608",2.5,"  And Oscar really?One Oscar would've been a stretch, several Oscars???it's obvious that the fish was sleeping with somebody else ...........","The Shape of Water",8608,4.2,1.7
"8609",0.5,"  1/2 star (only because I don't award zero stars)The way they see this villain is the way they see all non-leftists.Honestly, would be 5 stars if it ended the moment he shot them.Words cannot convey how bad this is. The cheerfulness of The Triumph of the Will, and a similar intent (kill the people who stand in the way of our perfect world of ""love"").I'm just going to end up writing a point by point dissertation about everything that makes this such an abortion of a movie...First scene is masturbatory. Obligatory gay mentor. Sassy black woman. Fart jokes. Uptight religious man. Old southern racist white villain. Weapon crazy. Sympathetic communists. Virtue signaling about civil rights. Equating humans with animals. Impugning moral cognizance to animals. Bestiality. Pagan worship. Inherent goodness. This is everything garbage about hollywood. One of the most one-dimensional, virtue-signalling movies I've ever seen. In Splash, she had to become human for sex. Not so, in today's hollywood. smh. No build up. No character complexity. Everything just happens all at once. It's horrible storytelling. Does anyone know how it got there & what it's doing there? Get a puppy! Just don't f it.It displays the selfishness of such people. She wants water sex, despite the damage it will do to the building and neighbors.The idea that a bathroom could stay filled with via towels on the floor is so banally stupid as to be insulting. The 21st century woman. Profane and perverted. Like Kimmel said, the only ""good"" men are gay, soviets, or fish. Pre-torture monologuing villain cliche is such poor writing. Truly, I could never love someone who loved this movie. Additionally, the crap writing of never explaining the scars. But everything else is so bad, a narrative misstep is the least of the problems.""God looks human like you... well, maybe more like me.""They thought this was clever? Seriously, who votes on this? Puerile, banal, cartoon drama. So overplaying the foreign empathy card as to do away with any semblance of reality. Mawkish. They became bff's after one meeting. Cause sea creatures are so common and easily understood. The worst kind of puerile hollywood schlock.Del Toro also overplays his hand in characterizing the heroes. Midway into the film, he reveals that Giles is gay when the character makes a pass at a friendly restaurant owner; the latter promptly kicks Giles out of the restaurant, along with a black couple who want to eat there. Though superfluous to the story, the scene reflects the movie's mission, to inspire sympathy with outsiders and anger toward anyone who would prevent them from experiencing love. This simplistic reduction of cold war-era society divides people into open-minded dreamers and narrow-minded villains. del Toro lays it on so thick that there's no room for counterargument or even independent thought. Ultimately his perspective is every bit as confining as the giant tank housing the creature at the lab, The best movie is now the one which makes me feel most righteous about myself for being a neo-Marxist left-winger. That's it. There is no other criteria.Too comfortable with itself to create any real dramatic tension.The film's heroes are so tolerant that they don't think to question the notion of a woman hooking up with a member of another species...del Toro isn't willing to acknowledge uncertainty or emotional or moral fallibility on the part of his heroesWithout a moment's hesitation, the fish is literally choosing which crappy jazz records to listen to her with. I'm supposed to take this seriously as art. Obligatory bigotry scene that has nothing to do with the story, except that it makes identity politicians feel good about themselves.""Just because I'm being nice, doesn't mean I want to be assaulted, gay neighbor.""If you have family values that don't include sodomy, you're probably a racist.Soviet spy will teach us about immigration.""I like that you're a mute, cuz I don't want my women speaking!"" Gimme a break.I was going for hands on hips pee guy because I felt sympathy for him for being written so one-dimensionally.I'm allowed to commit felony crime if I feel emotional about something.Hollywood demonstrated again that a movie doesn't actually have to be good to win best picture. It only has to offer the opportunity for liberal moral self-congratulation. #OscarsIt looked at her nice, so she obviously needs to keep it & prevent humanity to learn about a new species' biology. The irony is, it's only an immaterialist moral system that puts individual self-worth over collective. However, gillmen don't actually exist.I'm going to murder a human to save the life of an animal, under biological study. They should all hang.Happily ever after movies are usually panned by critics. I guess you have to be a minority or inter-bestial.These stupid people think that any kind of difference must be grounds for acceptance, not realizing there are considerations to acknowledge first, which they themselves admit to & betray.The plot is your basic disney kids dog pound plot. With added SJW. I love how they're portraying the villains as easily duped by ppl other than special forces... doesn't that take away from the ""heroism"" of the kidnapping?Yes, they're so quick to relate to anyone different....except, you know, the one-dimensional nazis the kill.A cold war movie where the creature & the soviet are the good guys. This is not by accident.And of course, the old familiar morally pure animal trope watching human evil in horror. Of course, the white nuclear family is the one where things are awry. Thank you, hollywood, for defending us from the horrors of suburbia.Bottom line, you can dress up crap, but it's still crap. Even if it's Academy awarded. This is nothing more than fish porn. Make no mistake. This is perversion. It is hollywood.","The Shape of Water",8609,4.2,3.7
"8610",0.5,"  So bad, I can't even put it in words.","The Shape of Water",8610,4.2,3.7
"8611",0.5,"  Truly a bad movie. When the synopsis says it is an other-worldly fairy tale, what that means is that the characters do not resemble real world people at all in their attitudes and motivations and that even a small child can guess what will happen just as in a fairy tale. This movie is utter garbage.","The Shape of Water",8611,4.2,3.7
"8612",4,"  The Shape of Water showcases some of the best of director Guillermo del Toro whose distinct vision and love of cinema shines through in this touching story. The characters and themes of acceptance are strongly represented, with Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer and Doug Jones all doing amazing jobs to completely captivate their characters. The music is moving and distinct while the visuals, including the set design are simply fascinating, making even a soap dispenser alluring. The narrative may be predictable with the stakes and twists not so surprising, but its probably the most complete and neat package awards contenders have offered this year, with the movies perfect length working in its favour.","The Shape of Water",8612,4.2,0.2
"8613",2,"  Movie was mostly just ""Meh"". Not sure how it received best picture. It is strange, in a good way, but mostly boring. The unnecessary nudity and masturbation scenes also prevents this from being a family movie. The reasoning was some BS from the director claiming some purpose of art or empowerment. Not that I mind nudity, I rather enjoy it, but at least say hey we wanted boobs in this cause it's boring and we need to spice it up.","The Shape of Water",8613,4.2,2.2
"8614",5,"  Have you ever just watched a movie and have just known that it would be one of your favorites. That was me watching this movie. Every ounce of me loves this movie. From how beautiful it is shot, how an amazing job the director did with it, the absolutely perfect acting, and the unique and beautiful story. Everything about this movie is perfect to me. For ever I have always said that The Dark Knight is my favorite movie but I can say that without a doubt that The Shape of Water is my new favorite film. If you haven't seen it you need to. This is a film fans movie.","The Shape of Water",8614,4.2,-0.8

"8617",1,"  I was so disappointed with this movie! The actors and cinematography were wonderful but the story was a combination of Beauty and the Beast, ET and Little Mermaid. And there was too much unjustified graphic violence.","The Shape of Water",8617,4.2,3.2

"8623",3,"  Very beautiful film, but its message is shallow. Taking a fairy tale and just putting it enough spin to turn it into a My-Little-Ponyish film seems like a tremendous waste of potential. This could have been so much more! Aesthetically, it is flawless, It's just the message that belongs more in a corny direct-to-dvd for kids than in a production of this calibre. I don't mean this message shouldn't be there, but we should get more layers, more complexity, more undertones, more subtext, something to make us want to re-watch The Shape Of Water. Instead we get the same thing hammered at us all throughout the film, and it subtracts a lot from the experience.","The Shape of Water",8623,4.2,1.2

"8628",4,"  It is surprising that this film is seldom recognized as a woman's sexual fantasy. She is, after all, clearly ""engaged"" as she reclines in her tub. She is also clearly of a certain age when her eggs are nearing their ""use by"" date, so cleverly illustrated by the egg timer. She is dreaming about someone who will want her eggs . Her experience with the opposite sex has not been positive, however. Her Macho boss and her effeminate friend are clearly not suitable so she creates a ""body"" for her eggs. Don't miss Sally Hawkins in ""maudie"".","The Shape of Water",8628,4.2,0.2
"8629",0.5,"  While hollywood limousine liberals scream and rave about the sexual abuse of women, they simultaneously vote ""best movie of the year"" for this filth. the star appears in full frontal nudity, baring her small breasts and pubic hair, then she proceeds to masterbate in her bathtub. the villain loses two fingers and tells his boss ""i still have my pussy finger"" before he appears on screen, screwing his wife. filthy language, needlessly so, filthy actions, needlessly so. these women demeaned themselves voluntarily. in twenty years, will they complain that they were exploited, as so many others have? it's the way of contemporary ""feminists"" - a one word oxymoron.don't see this trash. it is hollywood vulgarity and ignorance, with a monster strangely identical to a human body in a green camo wetsuit. did i say it was ignorant? that is an understatement.","The Shape of Water",8629,4.2,3.7

I've heard people praise it for giving an allegorical nod to 'love is love is love' type of stuff, but where *are* our queer characters finding love? And the only racism we see is clearly the product of problematic individuals, rather than anything to do with framing the systems at play that encourage / enable them. i don't know. i didn't care for it at all.","The Shape of Water",8631,4.2,1.7

I had little empathy for the rationale for the untenable relationship and the over the top intelligence operation. I was bored throughout. the motion picture academy is clearly too easily seduced by old world hollywood musical garnish and fairy tale gobbledygook. That this film won best picture is a travesty. By the way, the picture should have had more to overcome to win best picture by virtue of the fact that it borrowed much of the main concept from the movie splash which was a far more entertaining picture.","The Shape of Water",8637,4.2,2.7

"8641",4,"  ""The Shape of the Water"" is an lovely movie which tells the love story between a mute woman and a ""weird"" water creature. I think Del Toro shows, once again, all his talent, directing a simple yet poignant movie. I have loved the characters who take part to the story: both Octavia Spencer and Nick Searcy are amazing in their supporting roles. The star, of course, is the unbelievable Sally Hawkins, who's able to portray the mute main character with such a class that's impossible not to fall in love with her.Cinematography and the score are as great as you would expect from a Del Toro's movie. I firmly believe that ""The Shape of the Water"" is by far one of the most interesting movies done in these last 5 years.","The Shape of Water",8641,4.2,0.2

"8645",1.5,"  Although the film had some pluses such as the visuals the reality is that it was underwhelming. The film had so many plot holes that it was almost insulting to a moviegoers intelligence. It was almost like a parody of Beauty and the Beast. It was obvious shallow and overdone","The Shape of Water",8645,4.2,2.7
"8646",2.5,"  I thought The Shape of Water was OK. Not amazing. Not great. Not mindblowing. Just a basic OK.Yet it won 4 oscars. Why?Complete story with all spoilers: The Shape of Water is the story of a lonely mute woman working as a janitor in an army facility during the 1950s, who falls for a weird sea man creature who's kept captive there by a heartless army man. With the help of her old gay neighboor artist friend who happens to have a lot of free time on his hand because photographs have rendered his work for the advertising industry obsolete, a russian spy scientist, and her black janitor lady friend, she manages to save the weird sea man from being killed and dissected away. As our mute hero takes care of the beast she somehow falls in love with it and reaches orgasmic bliss. The army man tries to find out what happened, and after first being cluesless eventually manages to figure it out and catches the heroic couple as the beast is about to be released back into the sea. They fight, they all die, but turns out the beast has magical powers that can bring himself and his new lover back to life. They both escape into the sea. The end.The visuals, the actors: all great.The story: kind of OKish.The creepiness level: quite high at times.Is that enough to win an oscar? Apparently it's enough to win 4 of them.Why?Well.This movie is about a team of broken people sticking it up to the man, all to save, and fuck, an alien, who somehow happens to have great magical powers.You can't really get more progressive than this.The traditional white man, with his stay-at-home wife and his 2 kids, is portrayed as a sadistical tyrant with no redeeming quality other than his effectiveness at his job (and he's clearly super triggered when that only quality is being questioned), while the team of mute lady, gay old dude, and fat black girl, are super strong super nice and super good. The alien, a creepy and dangerous cat-eating savage beast, is actually a wonderful lover and some kind of God who can bring back the deads.Add the husband of the black lady who's just useless and pathetic, and the guy from the restaurant that the old gay character is in love with who turns out to reject the gay's advances while at the same time clearly signaling he's a racist intolerant asshole, and you end up with a pretty clear message: kill the old traditional western culture as it has no value whatsoever, and chose instead to embrace savagery because it's actually magical and fucking hot.That is a message that Hollywood loves. Hence the Oscars.And I don't even think this message is *entirely* wrong, but where is the nuance here? There's no nuance at all. And zero nuance is almost always entirely wrong.","The Shape of Water",8646,4.2,1.7

"8650",4,"  ""I do not fail, i deliver"" this film delivers. This is a visually beautiful film. All of the performances are exceptional ,the most of which being Michael Shannon's. Michael Shannon plays a very intelligent antagonist. For example, earlier in the movie he makes a statement about how washing your hands before or after urinating says something about your character. Nothing that he says feels pretentious or forced. The practical effects are great. The only downside to this movie is the gratuitous and unnecessary nudity. It adds nothing of merit or importance to the film, and is used way too often. Overall, this is a visually stunning movie with great performances and amazing storytelling, with it's only flaw being the unnecessary and forced nudity.","The Shape of Water",8650,4.2,0.2
"8651",2.5,"  I cannot believe that this ""Free Willy"" version from Guillermo del Toro won the oscar for best picture. It is not a bad movie, obviously, but nothing compared to ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The latter is a masterpiece and deserves all the kind of awards you throw at it, the former (the movie in question) is a boring story with some gruesome and unnecessary moments.

Michael Shannon continues to shine, no matter the part he plays! the story itself is interesting as the 'lovers' are mute--they are outcasts and prisoners at once and so are drawn into an cross-species bond--yes, you'll find parallels between this and 'beauty and the Beast'.

"8666",4,"  Guillermo del toro's best picture film shows that love has no boundaries. A unique approach to such a film as the main character is mute. The film is beautifully crafted and keeps the audience on its toes as the ending brings the whole film full circle. The film has a dark and eerie overarching mood and theme similar to Guillermo's other film series ""Hell boy"". Some could even go as far as calling this film a prequel to ""Hell Boy"" as this could be a backstory for the ""hell boy"" character Abe Sapien. With the overall mixture of beatuy and darkness is a no brainer why this was nominated for an academy award.","The Shape of Water",8666,4.2,0.2

Add this to the vast line up of Hollywood movies that injected over-the-top and old-timey Jim Crow racism to their themes and scripts this year-- in light of the Democrats labeling all conservatives as white racists.

"8685",0.5,"  Despite the incredible talent behind this film, it's a failure from start to finish. The inimitable Sally Hawkins is like a duck out of water and fails to bring this character to life. The visuals are recognisably those of Guillermo del Toro but the story telling is not. The story is pedestrian and predictable. Save yourself two hours and steer clear.","The Shape of Water",8685,4.2,3.7
"8686",4.5,"  Delightful film - the sense of time and place was very strong, as were the characters. The mix of thriller and fantasy was engaging and the storyline kept one guessing albeit that in the end the finale was predictable.","The Shape of Water",8686,4.2,-0.3

"8703",3,"  Admittedly, this film was OCCASIONALLY uncomfortable and many of its aspects were forced. There was little room to decipher the characters for anything other than what they were obviously made out to be, and the negative stereotypes and issues of the era were so clearly thrown into the script just to show that RACISM, sexism, communism...etc. all existed and are bad. Yet, This movie told a familiar story, all while being unfamiliar all the same. Sally Hawkins DELIVERED a strong moral character of ambition and love through her LONELINESS. The movie provided subtle meaningful cues and addressed important concepts while maintaining its plot, and the visual production ended up as MESMERIZING. It was an interesting watch that understandably landed Del Toro in the Oscars, but not personally Best Picture or anything I'd watch again.","The Shape of Water",8703,4.2,1.2

"8709",3.5,"  So, this isn't a bad movie but after watching most of the other nominees I am struggling to see how this managed to get best picture. So, the acting is impeccable with Sally Hawkins beautifully bringing to life a woman who has felt isolated because of her condition. It's visually stunning and the story is enjoyable enough but there is nothing particularly strong and stellar in regards to its plot. And this perhaps for me is the let down; I cannot identify with the central love story that they have tried to create and the need to unnecessarily sexualise the relationship undermines it further. The film relies heavily on the idea of this revolutionary relationship to credit it with its original and outlandish thinking. Strip away this twist and there's not much here that hasn't been done before and to a better standard.","The Shape of Water",8709,4.2,0.7

"8717",4,"  It's basically the adult version of ""the Little Mermaid"", but set in the timeline of 1960's in the United States with the gender in opposition to the fairy tale.The love is raw and authentic.

"8718",4.5,"  Well how do I start, I can not say too much about this film. At first glance, I did not knew what to expect (like in every del toro's film). I started watching the movie and I really felt that cinema love. I really really love del toro's art work. You got to love the scenarios and the shots, also The soundtrack is something you really got to enjoy in the movie. The story is something really new and I think some people would find it awkward in some point but if you see it in the point of view that its an original film story and something created out of guillermo del toro's imagination, you really find that special touch. i really hate that now days all the movies got the same story and plot twist so you will know what will happen. in this film its not like this. At least I, will never imagined the ending or the ""theories"" behind it. it really puts guillermo del toro in my top 10 best directors list. he never disappoints on what he does and I really think that this was a film well deserved of an oscar.","The Shape of Water",8718,4.2,-0.3
"8719",0.5,"  Way too long. I for one don't see what the critics saw in this movie. It was quite boring, had a lot of plot holes and situations that made no logical sense.

"8728",5,"  The Shape of Water is one of those Hollywood movies that feels like it made with actual passion. Just like other Guillermo Del Toro movies, the makeup for this movie is phenomenal. This man is a master at making movies like Pan's Labyrinth. Sally Hawkins gives an incredible performance. In fact, everyone gives a strong performance, especially Doug Jones. The score created by Alexandre Desplat was incredible. The main thing I love about this movie is the idea of every human being incomplete. It is a theme that is present throughout the movie and I absolutely love it. I don't think The Shape of Water is better than Pan's Labyrinth, but it's pretty damn close.","The Shape of Water",8728,4.2,-0.8

The fisH was also nameless. It wAs oscar MATERIAL because she DID Not say a word and for nudity.","The Shape of Water",8736,4.2,3.2
"8737",3,"  The Shape of Water is a very well done film. The casting all the way down to the set design is flawless. However, the plot was not my cup of tea. It was a very basic heart warming romantic story with some nudity and chronic masturbation sprinkled in. The plot was very predictable and half way through the plot really slows down and begins to drag. Overall, this movie was the most artistic but not the most entertaining movie of the year.","The Shape of Water",8737,4.2,1.2
"8738",3.5,"  Del Toro's dark fairytale is beautifully shot with slow-tracking camera moves drawing us right in to the eyes - and the souls - of the characters. Hawkins is an excellent choice for such an intimate and expressive mute character but the rest of the casting felt very safe. Shannon, Stuhlbarg and Spencer -all actors I admire - are just doing what they've done countless time before. Coupled with the story feeling like countless other fairytales and I left feeling like I hadn't experienced or learnt anything new. It is certainly visually accomplished and for ""best picture"" it deserves its accolades. ""Best story"" or ""movie-going experience""? I'm not convinced.","The Shape of Water",8738,4.2,0.7
"8739",0.5,"  Take out the gay pushing agenda, the unnecessary sex, nudity and masturbation scenes, and the excessive profanity and it could've been a decent movie, instead liberal Hollyweird shoving their agenda DOwn oir throats. Couldn't even finish the movie...","The Shape of Water",8739,4.2,3.7

"8751",2,"  Wow. Hollywood has become so incredibly transparent. So after The Artist, this is the movie that we have to fall in love with now. Because it is set in the early 60's, so nostalgia. Because the characters watch old black and white movies in their retro tv sets, while talking about how wonderful they are, so meta-nostalgia. Because the movie theater, the signs, the cars, the clothes, the pies and the diner...because nostalgia.Honestly, the story seems forced. Some characters and their relationships seem forced and placed/written just to make a point. The sassy black woman who complains throughout the movie about her husband (one could say she's actually complaining about all husbands, on behalf of all women), and finally puts him down at the end as the spineless coward he is. The old man who is unnecessarily shown to be a homosexual just so we can feel bad for him when he makes a totally uncalled for advance on the man who works the diner, who is an obviously straight white dude, who, for a twofer, gets to have a random black couple walk into the diner just so he can be racist on top of homophobic. I'm not going to focus on the other ""good guy"" being an actual communist, because even though the whole Russians subplot felt unnecessary and a bit forced, I understood his character as a scientist with a conscience, which made me understand his actions beyond his political and patriotic allegiances. And I honestly don't believe there is any relevance to him being a communist good guy. It's more about him being a non-U.S. citizen good guy. Did you know russians can be good people too? now you know.Now on to the bad guy. I'm not going to remark on him being a heterosexual white male, because a person in his position, in that time, would invariably fit that description. It's the fact that he is cold, emotionless, detached, cruel, racist, arrogant, classist, sadistic, tortures animals, is probably misogynistic, and is a general ""meanie"". the only thing missing is if they had literally named him ""donald"". the character feels like the product of the worst fears of a group of radical liberals assembled in a safe space, for the purpose of symbolizing in one man everything they consider to be evil in today's world. The funny thing is how they attempt to make the character profound or interesting, by making him get philosophical about pissing/washing your hands, and teaching us, I mean, the protagonists, about biblical characters and the meaning of certain complex-sounding words. And the whole bit about the candy. I don't get it. I don't buy it.I'll admit I was impacted by the loneliness and detachment that the protagonist must have felt to have engaged in such a relationship with a non-human creature, and I actually had no issue with the sexual aspect of the relationship, because, love is love. This is undoubtedly the most extreme version possible of that message, but it was only the underlying theme of the main story, as opposed to feeling like a message disguised as a story/character. and yet, upon reflection, i can't agree with this either. their romance is incredibly forced and rushed, and she basically has sex with him just because he has a humanoid shape. consider the relationships we build with cats, dogs, or other pets. it never crosses our minds, no matter how lonely we get, to have sex with them, because they look like animals. this creature barely communicates with her, but she decides to have sex with it because it resembles a human and stands on two feet. she's basically fucking her dog, if the dog could stand on two feet and had longer legs and arms. Think about this: There are gorillas who can communicate with sign language. you can have entire conversations with them, hundreds of times more complex than the 2 things the creature ""says"" to her. The gorilla has the most humanoid shape of any animal. so, basically, if he could stand on two feet and look her in the eyes, you could replace the lab with a zoo, the creature with a gorilla who knows sign language, and she ends up, inevitably, fucking a gorilla.The scene that perfectly encapsulates why you will be told to love this movie, is the fantasy sequence where the mute girl starts singing beautifully, and then tap dances with the sea creature on a beautiful stage backed by a big band. All in black and white, of course. Because, nostalgia. even people who liked the movie find this scene laughable and forced.The end also comes out of nowhere, when the creature somehow turns her scar tissue into functional gills. This is the only moment, other than the intro, when the movie felt to me like a fairy tale story. The movie itself didn't feel to me like it was trying to emulate Beauty and The Beast or some other tale, rather it was just inspired by it and other similar tales. The story felt like it was doing its own thing (unlike something like Pacific Rim, for example, which is meant to be viewed as an anime), which makes the fairytale intro and ending feel out of place and forced. If you like Guillermo Del Toro, who I'm not too much of a fan of, other than of his visual imagination, check out any of his other stuff. If you liked Sally Hawkins' performance (which is not ""stellar"", or ""phenomenal""), you'll be much better off seeing her in Happy-Go-Lucky or Made In Dagenham. Or watch her in this too (she does a good job) and make up your own mind about the whole thing. Just don't let Hollywood awards shows and critics dictate what you should watch and much less what you should like and love. Remember The Artist. Remember The Last Jedi. Remember The Shape Of Water.","The Shape of Water",8751,4.2,2.2

"8753",3,"  As visually delightful as it is simple in narrative, the shape of water is poetry in motion. Filled with allegorical characters and motifs, the shape of water has more to it than meets the eye. having said that, I Believe that the shape of water relies a bit too much on the audience reading between the lines, appreciating its visual appeal and drooling over del toro's craftsmanship. the film looks great, flows well but there is nothing new to appreciate, in terms of content and aesthetics. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY UNI-DIMENSIONAL AND OTHER THAN SALLY HAWKINS, THERE IS NO PERFORMANCE THAT ONE CAN MAKE A SPECIAL MENTION OF.

"8770",3.5,"  The Shape of Water is no Abe Sapien prequel, well yes it is. Even though del Toro tried to distance it from the Hellboy connection it was. I enjoyed the film, even though it was a spin on Beauty and the Beast. Was actually hoping for a bit more of a fresh storyline, but got much of the formulaic storyline and expected results. Good rental for Blueray, not so much a theater must. Will still consider it part of the Hellboy world. Fits the DieselPunk Genre.","The Shape of Water",8770,4.2,0.7

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen and there are some good things about it. The setting of the movie with the music are awesome. The characters are enjoyable but with all that being said the movie really drags on and is plagued with tons of awkward scenes that don't contributed to the movie in anyway. Tons of masturbation scenes just to show how lonely the main actress is. I guess to justify the sex scene she has with a fish man later, which is totally disgusting. You can't compare this to something like beauty and the beast. Anyone who says this is a great piece of art is delusional and look into things way to much to the point its borderline idiotic. It's the equivalent of finding some deep meaning to opening a can of spaghettios. If you choose to watch this movie, make sure not to do it around family because it is slow and extremely awkward.","The Shape of Water",8773,4.2,2.2

"8775",5,"  SPOILER I find it incredibly sad so many narrow minded people didn't either a. get the message of the movie, or b. were to engrossed stuffing popcorn in their traps they missed the critical information about WHY Elisa is attracted to the creature. She was found on a river bank in South America. She has scars on her neck that have been there since childhood. She controls the water on the window with her hand when riding the bus. The signals were all there for anyone who paid attention to the movie to see but most didn't. She was the same creature but she evolved differently. Even the doctor comments that the creature can breathe in and out of water. It wasn't a degree in physics needed to understand the film. It is not a liberal agenda film either. Gays and blacks had very little rights despite supposedly having them during this era. It was a time period in history where many of US citizens lived in fear of nuclear attack by Russia and bombing drills were held in school. The creature can sense what Elisa is but fears her slightly because she appears human. It is a beautiful tale of acceptance, love, and bravery by a woman the world sees as defective. The cinematography was stunning. The ethereal use of the blues and greens was just as stunning. Actually watch the movie and see the clues, and maybe those who hated it might actually see what I am talking about.","The Shape of Water",8775,4.2,-0.8

"8787",3,"  The Shape of Water is a very creative and stunningly visual and sounding film, but with an underwhelming story and slower pace. Sally Hawkins' Elisa is mute and communicates through sign language. She lives a boring life as a janitor for a secret government laboratory, with the only the only people close to her being a woman named Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins). The leader of the facility, Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) captures a creature in South America and houses it in his facility. Elisa slowly develops a strong bond with this creature, who is actually very intelligent and able to understand human language and emotions. The film focuses on this relationship, which is a very weird concept between a mute woman and a creature from far away. The plot is also very predictable too once audiences figure out the premise, have seen the trailer, or heard anything about the film. The pacing can also be a bit slow at times, as not much occurs in the way of meaningful events for long durations of the film. There are many positives to the film however. The story is very creative unlike many modern Hollywood films. The movie is also visually stunning and the music and sound mixing is well done. 1960's America is captured perfectly and there are some great songs that add to the emotion of certain scenes. There are also standout performances from all of the actors and actresses, who are deservingly being considered for numerous awards. Overall, The Shape of Water is a creative, well acted, and visually stunning film, but it overshadowed by a simple and predictable premise and long duration of slow pace scenes.","The Shape of Water",8787,4.2,1.2
"8788",0.5,"  F*ck this movie. It should never have won Best Picture. The real movie that should've won was Get Out. I mean seriously, some drugged woman falls in love with an amphibian or what ever that thing is. While Get Out had a message that racism is still around today and we need to do something about it.

"8791",4.5,"  In what is hands down Guillermo Del Toro's best film since ""Pans Labyrinth"", ""The Shape of Water"" shows Del Toro is best when working with a smaller budget. With the budget coming in at 20 million, I was amazed by how much they were able to accomplish with this film and how the movie never looks cheap. Shot by cinematographer Dan Lausten, the movie is beautiful to look at. Whether it be in the water or in a hotel room the movie looks gorgeous. The performances from Sally Hawkins and the supporting cast was fantastic. Playing a mute woman, Hawkins has to convincingly rely on facial expressions throughout the film. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are great and Michael Shannon plays a fantastic villain.The only problem I had with this movie was some parts of the relationship between Sally Hawkins and the sea creature. I found that the relationship was somewhat underwritten and rushed along. They maybe could have added a couple of extra scenes to flesh out their connection.Overall, we got a beautiful film that will rank as one of Guillermo Del Toro's best films to date.Final Score: 4.5/5 or 9 out of 10","The Shape of Water",8791,4.2,-0.3

"8796",1,"  Somehow this movie is both incredibly simple and childish while also being gruesome and graphically sexual. The entire plot is obvious from the movie poster, and the gratuitous sexual scenes take away more than they help the main story.Admittedly there is a high level of discipline demonstrated in creating a consistent aesthetic in the production, but outside of that almost black and white old time-y vibe, I almost found nothing in this movie enjoyable. The amphibian man is far too simple to care strongly for, the protagonist is so relentlessly driven and fearless that she comes off as childish. The main supporting role of her friend is fairly likable, but everyone else is at best a mixed case. The script is at times laughable, which I guess is the one clearly redeeming quality.","The Shape of Water",8796,4.2,3.2

"8799",4,"  If you're not sure what The Shape of Water is about by just watching the trailer, and if you're confused because water doesn't have a shape when it comes down to it, you're not the only one. Basically, it is an R-rated girlish dream love story about a mute janitor who falls in love with a mutant fish-man.It is a fairy tale like The Little Mermaid except the roles are reversed. The man of the water meets the woman of the land. It is the ultimate fish out of water tale because to keep him alive she must logically, keep him in a bathtub. Ironically, this film is also a great resource for how to keep a fish alive in a tub for over a week.This very magical film becomes interesting when the character who we will affectionately call ""Fish-Jesus"" performs an act of God, healing a bald man of male pattern baldness by simply touching the top of his head. Insta-hair. This was hilarious!The Shape of Water is a film that I see could be part of a Shark Week special titled 'Sleeping With Sharks' on the next Shark Week. It is a romance we have not yet seen on the big screen. A love story that Director Guilermo Del Toro says was inspired by the 1960s character Gill-man from the film Creature from the Black Lagoon. Some may say she ""goes overboard"", or ""went off the deep end"" when she falls in love with the fish-man.Spoiler: There is a scene where water starts falling from the ceiling of the Theatre which I will not spoil but because of this film, the next time I am in the theatre and a water drops fall from the ceiling I am going to think twice. ""Tut tut it looks like rain."" -In the words of the animated iconic character Pooh Bear. But very positively for The Shape of Water, the award nominations are raining down.

"8811",1.5,"  I honestly don't get the praise for this movie. The basic logic of this movie is completely unbelievable and down right dumb. Now I'm very cool with weird fantasy movies and honestly a maybe fish girl falling for a fishy, amazonian river god doesn't bother me. What bothers me is ever other dumb aspect of this movies story. The main plot focuses on how the U.S. want to study and disect the creature because it some how will give them an edge in the space race. That premise is flimsy at best as its never really explained why fish guy is important other than he can breath for a while outside of water. How that translates to traveling in space is beyond me, but thats the main plot. So the story focuses on a mute maid, who works at a top secret facility with the worlds worst security. The main bad guy gets two of his fingers bitten off early in the film, but the maids are apparently allowed to work alone in the room with the creature, so long as they only spend twenty minutes in there. The mute girl manages to form a relationship with fish guy and smuggles eggs and a fuckin record player in to the room where she loudly plays music and dances and nobody notices except the secret russian spy. Come on! They dont even put a cover on the damn things tank, thats a basic requirement for a home fish tank, let alone a creature that just bit a guys fingers off. And then of course there is the russians who want to kill the creature, so americans cant use it to win the space race (it justs so fucking stupid). Also our mute maid girl is an orphan found on a river bank in mexico and has weird scars on her neck which surprise, surprise turn into gills at the end of the film. The movie is in general just an uneven mess, much of the plot doesn't really matter and the characters are constantly questioning why their life sucks and they feel out of place. And hey, I get that the message of the movie is about feeling out of place and unloved, but the characters don't go anywhere, or evolve. Mute girl spends the movie in a constant child like fog where she eventually bangs a fish guy. Her gay artist friend is a failed artist, looking for love in all the wrong places and is the same guy at the beginning of the movie that he is at the end. Mute girls maid friend, just complains about being in a unloving relationship and just seems to be there as mute girls stereotypical black Jimminy Cricket friend. This movie simply does not deserve an oscar nomination.","The Shape of Water",8811,4.2,2.7

"8817",3.5,"  While the set-up, production design, acting and directing is flawless I found myself a tad underwhelmed by the film after so much praise. It's the story. Once you heard the premise you can pretty much figure out the entire plot. That's a little disappointing for such an unusual and ambitious project. A lot of Del Toro's quirky trademarks are there, but it's a surprisingly mainstream film, if bestiality doesn't bother you.","The Shape of Water",8817,4.2,0.7
"8818",4.5,"  ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, for You are everywhere"" It is this beautiful poem which graces director, Guillermo del Toro's (Pan's Labyrinth) latest film, The Shape of Water. an outing that has been praised by critics and viewers alike, including 13 nominations at the Academy Awards. I watched this movie a day before the awards themselves, curious to see whether the ecstasy surrounding this film was deserved. Del Toro is a director whose work I occasionally struggle to enjoy and sometimes even understand, his work often being somewhat surreal and unusual to say the least. But, I was wrong to doubt. The Shape of Water is a mesmerising film, unique and stunningly executed. The story tells of the touching romance between cleaner, Elisa and an aquatic creature captured in the lab she works in. Helped by her isolated neighbour, Giles (played with lovely humanity by Richard Jenkins) and co-worker Zelda (portrayed, if slightly safely, by Octavia Spencer), Elisa attempts to help rescue her lover, against the threatening backdrop of a Cold War- espionage scheme.The film plays nice homage to movies of the 1950s, the time in which it is set; production design and visual style really emanate the Frankensteins and Flash Gordons of this time period very nicely, whilst all giving a new level of elegance and charm making SOW, visually, a treat. The direction is clever and succinct by Del Toro, with subtle references to social-historical context that interweaves and compliments the narrative. Del Toro is a seasoned veteran and it is easy to see why.Sally Hawkins is fantastic as the mute Elisa, performing almost entirely through sign language yet still conveying a real sense of emotion and believability. Doug Jones also portrays real humanity as the Creature; it is a compliment to these two actors that the romance between Elisa and the Creature is not only believable but beautiful too. Michael Shannon is suitably terrifying as Streckland, ambitious and longing to have the Creature in his grasp. Whilst Streckland's turn from racist scumbag to complete psychopath seems a little unbelievable (all it took was two fingers), Shannon's performance is fantastic, as is Michael Stuhlbarg, playing a Cold War spy with conviction.Accompanying the movie is Alexandre Desplat's mystical score, which is perfectly compatible with the feel of the film, as is the film's whole design, which is minimalistic, yet exquisite.Perhaps the greatest part of The Shape of Water however is its profound message of inclusivity and acceptance. Elisa and the Creature find love with one another as incomplete and isolated beings which accept eachother as they are and do not try to change eachother. Jenkin's Giles remains isolated from all but Elisa, due to the homosexuality he attempts to closet and Spencer's Zelda faces an unhappy marriage and racist snipes in her workplace. Through the film, we come to understand and empathise with these characters and through it we can understand the truly important message Del Toro is presenting; one of acceptance, respect and love.Overall, The Shape of Water is one of the finest films of 2017; crisply directed, heart-breaking yet witty, and visually breathtaking, here stands a picture well deserving of its acclaim, holding an important and timeless message.","The Shape of Water",8818,4.2,-0.3
"8819",0.5,"  Absolutely terrible film, I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. Nothing remotely intelligent or well crafted about the while thing.","The Shape of Water",8819,4.2,3.7
"8820",4,"  Rating: A-Guillermo del Toro proves that his visuals are as impeccable as ever. Such a beautifully directed film, with so much vivid colors and wonderful production design. The editing is flawless, the score is magical and the cinematography is incredibly gorgeous.Sally Hawkins (Elisa Esposito) has a phenomenal performance. She is able to transmit her feelings in such a classy way and without saying a single word throughout the entire movie. Oscar-worthy display as well as the rest of the fantastic cast. Michael Shannon (Strickland) and Octavia Spencer (Zelda) are great, but Richard Jenkins (Giles) is right up there with Sally. An all-star cast delivers perfect performances that carry a meaningful, romantic and unique story.Unfortunately, not everything is perfect. The tone and the pacing are a bit unbalanced, but my main issue is the cheesy and predictable third act. Even though the story alone justifies watching this film, some people might find creepy the relationship between Elisa and the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones).Still, it is a brilliant screenplay with a lot of important messages and del Toro does an outstanding job directing The Shape of Water, which will surely get him a win at the 90th Academy Awards. It does not do enough for entering my Top10: Best Movies of 2017, but it gets a well-deserved Honorable Mention.","The Shape of Water",8820,4.2,0.2
"8821",4,"  ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, For You are everywhere.""It might not be as magical as Pan's Labyrinth but it certainly has the soul of the former. Its a love story, a fairy tale, a healing tale for the troubled times.One of my favorites of 2017. Oscar for probably Best Original Score and Director.","The Shape of Water",8821,4.2,0.2
"8822",3,"  While the cinematography was absolutely beautiful, I found the movie to be boring. I knew what to expect (i.e., that this was a fantasy story), but I could not emotionally engage with the characters at all. I was checking the time throughout the entire movie and was definitely happy when it ended. The film should definitely receive an award for cinematography, but if this wins best picture, I will be extremely disappointed.","The Shape of Water",8822,4.2,1.2
"8823",4,"  Visually stunning and distinct, it feels like a fairy tale shoved into the cold war era. Sally Hawkins delivers a brilliant performance as a mute character while the legendary Doug Jones makes a fish man real.","The Shape of Water",8823,4.2,0.2
"8824",0.5,"  A movie that picks up as a neo-Beauty and the Beast theme, it delivers a nice musical score and artistic merit. For that it fails in content, however, and screenplay, not shy to overview too much the main character's morning self pleasure scene and, not the least, bestiality scenes. How did this movie make it to the Academy for ? It is a profound mistery- the same way as Moonlight inexplicably won. Perhaps the Academy is under pressure to reward movies depicting minorities or an anti-state theme, such as this one.","The Shape of Water",8824,4.2,3.7
"8825",5,"  How very romantic and perfect. M Shannon pretty good as a character. Olivia Spencer as usual very funny with her talk and language of her face hmmm...Miss cheeky way","The Shape of Water",8825,4.2,-0.8

"8830",5,"  This is beauty and the beast & Pans Labyrinth?s love child!","The Shape of Water",8830,4.2,-0.8
"8831",1,"  The Shape of Water essentially stole some of the look&feel from Amelie and turned it into a horrifically ridiculous movie with no interesting story line or plot containing flat one-dimensional characters who I could not understand or care for, it was utterly boring and predictable until the end without any depth or message. By the end I was ready to jump into the same river to drown myself.","The Shape of Water",8831,4.2,3.2
"8832",5,"  What is there to say about this movie hasn't been said already so worth seeing and such beautifully directed. His best work yet.","The Shape of Water",8832,4.2,-0.8
"8833",5,"  The Shape of Water was a delightfully surprising movie that showcased, not only disabled characters but queer characters and people of colour beautifully. It brought forth the need to be accepted for who you are, eve if that is only by one person, and that love really knows no bounds. This is a movie I would see again in a heart beat!","The Shape of Water",8833,4.2,-0.8
"8834",2,"  I was really wanting to like this movie. The sex scenes were not necessary. The cinematography was excellent; most of the scenes were at night or underground & had a bluish tint. The storyline had holes even after forgetting the sex scenes. The doctor knows he is going to die: why does he give up the ladies. The healing power thing. I don't care how hungry you are don't eat cats. For me, The Shape of Water does not hold water.","The Shape of Water",8834,4.2,2.2

"8837",0.5,"  Can not believe this movie would ever be considered for an Academy Award. Lousy movie!!!","The Shape of Water",8837,4.2,3.7
"8838",1,"  This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. There is nothing artsy or remotely good about it. You quite literally have to have an extraordinarily low IQ to sit through that and think it all resembles anything worthy of acclaim. Utterly terrible!","The Shape of Water",8838,4.2,3.2
"8839",3,"  Michael Shannon is a great villain, and del Toro directed well with his typical style. I was just not impressed by what is not a very original story. It's pretty much Free Willy, turned into a love story with the creature from the black lagoon. I liked it, but it is over-rated in my opinion.","The Shape of Water",8839,4.2,1.2
"8840",0.5,"  Terrible, it was predictable and boring . I do not understand what the fuss is about.","The Shape of Water",8840,4.2,3.7
"8841",5,"  Stunning to watch. Mesmerizing scenery and backdrops play masterfully with the hauntingly gorgeous performance of Sally Hawkins.","The Shape of Water",8841,4.2,-0.8
"8842",4.5,"  If this is not the 2017 Best Picture winner at the Oscars then I don't know what. Del Toro, writer and director, chooses to keep his leads silent, thereby broadening their appeal in this story about loneliness and separation, and the joy of discovering that that is not exactly so. Like lasagna, there are many levels to this, kudos to cinema, music, dance, photography, to humanity, to love ... it is a tour de force of a work, meant to be experienced more than simply just once. And Hawkins is a revelation.","The Shape of Water",8842,4.2,-0.3
"8843",4.5,"  Visual poetry. The Shape of Water is a perfect example of masterclass filmmaking.","The Shape of Water",8843,4.2,-0.3
"8844",3.5,"  The Shape of Water is undeniably unique. The production design, cinematography, visual effects and score make you feel like you're in another world. The story, however, feels a little watered down. It takes an interesting concept and stretches it a little too thin, while patting itself on the back for being so artistic. I really enjoyed watching Sally Hawkins' and Doug Jones' performances, but this isn't Guillermo del Toro's best work.","The Shape of Water",8844,4.2,0.7
"8845",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is a wonderful modern fairy tale where the technical aspects are the highlights: the use of lighting in recreating the mood of the protagonist is superb, the film looks splendid and visually arresting, the score is understated but very pleasing, the pacing is excellent and del Toro's direction is reliably great. The acting is terrific across the board with the highlights being Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer and Sally Hawkins. It is not a fantastic film as it is undone by its excessive, distracting and entirely unnecessary gore and violence plus it needed more romance in it. The second half is more straightforward and predictable, but the first half is almost flawless. It is in the end a flawed, but still excellent film which is consistently involving to watch and populated by highly likable, wonderful characters.","The Shape of Water",8845,4.2,-0.3
"8846",5,"  This is fantasy storytelling at its best, always balanced and well designed. The direction and production are flawless and precise; it reminds me of the best films by Stanley Kubrick in its approach and craftsmanship. The design of the film is very well planned, the gloomy, dark blue green atmosphere with retro mechanical devises and furniture combined and of course together with the creature give that special Del Toro feeling that now is so characteristic of his films like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" ""Crimson Peak"" ""Hellboy"" ""The Devils Backbone"" and many others both as director and writer.I suppose the creature is the same from the film ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" from 1954 who as far as I know, was also misunderstood and mistreated, this is not strange Del Toro is surely a fan of old monster and adventure films from the past. What is really extraordinary with his films is that all these ""creatures"" or ""monsters"" have a human dimension and breathe in the realm of empathy just as other normal human being would, so this creature has a special quality that is very related to humans but at the same time, there is no way out: it is a beast, ambivalence which creates an interesting situation, similar to the one in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with unknown consequences for the characters involved. So it's not necessary with so much explanation for where is this creature from or how was it taken, only a few short words that it is coming from the swamps of the jungle somewhere in the far south.Del Toro goes even farther out than Mary Shelley with the feelings of his monster as he makes him almost human in some aspects, special when it comes to his libido where together with his innate empathy for other beings that are nice with him, can express it wonderfully. And I must say that all the actors make a very good job, each with a very distinctive personality, the cruel torturist, the well-intended, the helpful, the leader, even the homosexual is represented and acting extremely well. All in all I must say I enjoyed this film and popcorn was very well spent. Highly recommended.","The Shape of Water",8846,4.2,-0.8
"8847",3.5,"  A modern fairy tale. While the plot takes a few leaps of logic, the performances , the visuals, and the overall direction by Guillermo del Toro make for entertaining cinematic viewing.","The Shape of Water",8847,4.2,0.7
"8848",4,"  Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece is a contorted romantic journey in the (in)human condition, Its extremely engaging, stunningly cute, harsh, musical, violent and breathtaking. He is and always been a very particular in storytelling, Pan's labyrinth & Crimson Peak[1] are the perfect example of it.Movie plot took place around 1960 - a cold war era. Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a mute character, works as cleaning woman in an underground facility where scientific experiments took place. The place is run by General Hoyt and his security team. Story revolved around Elisa's daily life who has a co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer ) and a gay-neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins) to express her muteness. Story took a turn when Hawkins falls in love with a Gilled Amphibian Monster(Doug Jones) captured by a greedy human monster Richard (Michael Shannon). Bond gets stronger between Elisa and Amphibian man. Occam facility's decision to use amazon god for a cruel experiments left no choice to Hawkins but to stage an escape plan with whatsoever resources she has so far.Yet, No brief synopsis can fully convey the projection of Del Toro's beautiful imagination, Its treat which is to just feel rather than watch.Elisa's character is so powerful, a quietness with curious and observational eyes add more power to her character, she has literally used every muscle to express her emotions. An Opening scenes established Elisa's character with the great details. Bathtub scene with a timer portrait her loneliness and sexual enthusiasm due to that, Tearing calendar pages shows purposeless routine life, Early scenes with Giles portrait her as Dreamy Princess. Number of scenes like expressing her first meeting with creature to Giles or convincing for the rescue attempt of creature to Giles, creature's first touch at Bathtub are beautifully performed with intense emotions, she definitely delivered an performance that come along rarely in an artist's life.That scene between her and Giles when she asks Giles to help in the escape plan is the best scene of the movie, best enough to get the nomination for best actress.Movie concept is really ordinary, certainly a risky concept for a director like Del Toro but as movie proceeds, you'll feel that its Del Toro through and through. Combination of Hawkin's quietness, amphibious inhuman, Shannnon's powerful and monstrous character built a perfect fairy tale. Story telling with the great details is the gem of the movie. Cadillac showroom scene was somehow irritant to the plot but it was the perfect example of portraying Shannon's power. Green tone is nicely synced in all the scenes to create 60s effect. The art direction of the climax is extraordinary.The Shape of water is stunningly beautiful. Just go with it and get the best dive you'll ever had.","The Shape of Water",8848,4.2,0.2
"8849",0.5,"  FUGG-A-FISH had too many bubbles in its plot, its story line did not hold water; and overall was a pile of crap... Or, better stated: A POOL of CARP.","The Shape of Water",8849,4.2,3.7
"8850",0.5,"  Such a boring movie, I could watch only 40 minutes, so naive and predictable. It is a true wonder how the critics are accepting the movie. One of the worst of 2017, sorry.","The Shape of Water",8850,4.2,3.7
"8851",3.5,"  I didn't think I would like a movie about bestiality with an aquatic animal this much outside of a Troy McClure biopic...but here we are, and if you would have told me to pick which Best Picture nominee featured the most masturbation scenes and finger trauma I would have put ""Call Me By Your Name"" as a heavy -2500 favorite...but here we are. Fish love, egg timers and gangrenous appendages aside, this was a really good movie and although not my favorite of the year I wouldn't be mad at all if it won the Oscar.","The Shape of Water",8851,4.2,0.7
"8852",3.5,"  not as good as Toro's previous works as it lack the distinctive elements of horror, mystery. Otherwise its a definitely watchable film.","The Shape of Water",8852,4.2,0.7
"8853",5,"  Simplemente hermosa.","The Shape of Water",8853,4.2,-0.8
"8854",5,"  I lved this flick. I've lays loved the tale of the maiden rescuing the knight. Here we have it very well told with an excellent sociopath of a bad guy. I loved that it was set In the early 60's during the Cold War. Before there was any success In combating racism or homophobia or zemophobia.","The Shape of Water",8854,4.2,-0.8

"8856",5,"  So beautiful, imaginative, and honest in its perfection of those at the margins. The script: folklore dancing with Americana peppered with the brutality of prejudice. Wow, just wow. I had not read any reviews of The Shape of Water but had seen one trailer. Now, I want to see it again.","The Shape of Water",8856,4.2,-0.8

"8860",4,"  En plus d'une très belle prestation de l'actrice Sally Hawkins, The Shape of Water est probablement l'une des plus belles réalisation de Guillermo Del Toro et parvient en même temps à rendre hommage de façon assez originale aux classiques du cinéma","The Shape of Water",8860,4.2,0.2
"8861",4,"  A surprisingly good movie! Couched amongst the standard Hollywood Cold War cliches is an off beat science fiction love story between a woman and a fishman. Impressively, it actually works very well.","The Shape of Water",8861,4.2,0.2
"8862",4,"  My wife loved it. I thought the relationship was rushed. But a beautifully shot fantasy nonetheless.","The Shape of Water",8862,4.2,0.2
"8863",4,"  I knew I'd love this movie because I'm a sucker for unconventional love stories and I'm already in love with the creature. Such an amazing story with great acting.","The Shape of Water",8863,4.2,0.2
"8864",5,"  The Shape of Water (2017) was an absolute delight. It was a perfect adult fairy tale and not what I was expecting at all. It has an otherworldly feel to it, great soundtrack, amazing story, and suitable effects. Wasn't expecting a Cold War period drama but it's that too! A+ movie","The Shape of Water",8864,4.2,-0.8
"8865",5,"  Del Toro really drives the notion of: if you ever felt you were from another time and place, but having to live with the reality of this is where I am right now. The period the movie's set in matches the mood of the story - grim with a bit of hope. Shannon's instant karma is somewhat funny and tragic. I feel sorry for him...almost. Great acting by all! Beautiful set design and the amphibian man's costume is flawless.","The Shape of Water",8865,4.2,-0.8
"8866",1.5,"  Strong acting, but a terrible plot. Dull, slow moving, and not very thought inspiring. Scenes have a tendency to drag with very little progression. After enjoying Pan's Labrynth immensely, I expected to be delighted with this movie, but was completely underwhelmed.","The Shape of Water",8866,4.2,2.7
"8867",0.5,"  No need for sexual content or nudity. The point was clear without that nonsense.","The Shape of Water",8867,4.2,3.7
"8868",2,"  With all the Oscar talk and plagiarism controversy swirling around it, I don't know what I really expected out of this flick... It has Guillermo del Toro written all over it, undoubtedly, with a surreal atmosphere like a combination of ""Hell Boy"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" as well as a strong ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" vibe.By the way, the Universal Studios ""Creature"" trilogy of the 1950s is one of del Toro's favorite monster treatments, and it's one that he wanted to remake in his own style, but Universal rejected his repeated proposals for years.This movie, however, doesn't really adhere to the aforementioned influences; rather, it enters the realm of Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" with the same simplistic storyline: An intelligent (even ""magical"") monster is brought into a dreamy caricature of ""modern"" mid-20th Century civilization, where it manages to make both loving friends and brutal enemies and eventually escapes back to its remote origins once more.Yes, there is the much-touted love interest between the monster and a human female; but this is no more derivative than ""The Creature"" was derivative of ""King Kong"" or a dozen other films in which the monster falls for the girl. That's just a time-worn Hollywood trope.I suppose I expected to see the elements that made ""The Shape of Water"" worthy of an Academy Award nomination...and I came away disappointed, because I just don't see it as Oscar-worthy.Production-wise, ""Shape of Water"" is only so-so: the story is a Hollywood standard; the sets are colorful but not especially innovative; the great majority of the monster effects are just latex; the musical score is not particularly memorable; and the acting is only adequate.Then there are the numerous stereotypes: the black and latino ""cleaning ladies"" who become ""empowered""; the bible-thumping white ""big boss man"" who sadistically bullies and tortures and shoots anyone that crosses his path; the ""devious Russians"" carrying out covert operations; and, of course, the ""lonely homosexual"" who has been alienated all his life by 20th Century Western society.Please, Guillermo. A 21st-Century ""social justice"" monster movie? Sheesh.These stereotypes are politically-correct cardboard cut-outs (unlike the characters in most del Toro films), which left me thinking that del Toro didn't work his usual magic on this one.So, no. No Oscar vote here.","The Shape of Water",8868,4.2,2.2
"8869",3,"  What's all the praise for on this one. Good love story but you can play it all out before it happens.","The Shape of Water",8869,4.2,1.2
"8870",4.5,"  Del Toro at his best since Pan's Labyrinth, with a story beautifully portrayed by a stellar cast and powerfully led by Sally Hawkins as a strong and unique heroine paired with Doug Jones at his best performance yet. A uniquely beautiful, and thrilling tale of love, The Shape of Water is not a film to be missed.","The Shape of Water",8870,4.2,-0.3
"8871",1,"  The Shape of Cliche. Can't believe this totally predictable, schmaltzy rehash of twenty other movies got high audience reviews. The entire thing felt like it was thrown together in a week from a grab bag of cliches--not an original idea in it. And after you think the saccharine can't be piled on any higher in this long, drawn out mess, we get a POEM at the end--the narrator just can't shut up. All I can say is I guess most of the viewers didn't see the twenty other movies this one stole from. Maybe this could work for children, but sex with a reptile? I don't think so. Hollywood, get a grip, you have lost all touch with reality.","The Shape of Water",8871,4.2,3.2
"8872",3,"  I was a bit disappointed by this film. Admittedly my expectations were high going into it. The premise is magnificent and the trailer got me so excited to see what looked like a wonderful mix of Amelie's charm with Pan's Labyrinth's visuals and ultimately that is exactly what this film is, no less but nothing more either. The highlights were in the performances across the board and also the creature design. Overall it was an enjoyable watch but pretty much exactly what you might expect.","The Shape of Water",8872,4.2,1.2
"8873",5,"  Guillermo at his dark romantic best, shape of water is so much more than what you think. Like most toro films, the darkness of the characters and bleak story makes you feel like a horror film almost at first, but what seems so dark turns so romantic. Strong acting work from Shannon (extremely dark character) and a game stopping turn from Sally Hawkins, shape of water will leave you breahless","The Shape of Water",8873,4.2,-0.8
"8874",4.5,"  Ferociously unique, deliciously romantic, an ode to humble generosity and improbable love as well as an uncontrollable hate cry against big brother. Charming! Gripping! Horrifying! What else do you want?","The Shape of Water",8874,4.2,-0.3

"8876",4.5,"  im not here for graphic violence, everything else is great","The Shape of Water",8876,4.2,-0.3
"8877",3,"  Where to start with this one...To start off this movie is visually beautiful. The production design was very detailed and you could obviously tell that there was house of planning to make sure that every detail was executed perfectly. Now for the actually movie. I felt that this movie was very artistic in its approach which at some times made it hard to see the time of the movie. At times it was very lighthearted, funny, and fairy tale like. At other times it was very dark, extremely violent, and disturbing. The movie wasn't bad at all though, most of the characters were easy to relate too and the main actress, Sally Hawkins (Best Actress) is amazing. Her character is mute, but it doesn't seem like it. You could tell all of her emotion just by the way she carries herself. The main villain, Strickland was oddly menacing even though the actor, Michael Shannon is known for his funny roles. One the main woman's best friends, Giles, played by Richard Jenkings (Best Supporting Actor) brings such light to the movie that you would want him to be your own neighbor. The other best friend, who is played by Octavia Spencer (Best Supporting Actress) is funny and emotion in all of her screen time. I did not like the ending because I felt it was too unrealistic, even for a fantasy, but it made sense as to the type of love story they were trying to convey.","The Shape of Water",8877,4.2,1.2
"8878",3.5,"  A bit weird but not bad","The Shape of Water",8878,4.2,0.7
"8879",0.5,"  Cliched characters, dull storyline and ridiculous premise. I tried to like this film but it was awful and weird.","The Shape of Water",8879,4.2,3.7
"8880",4,"  I loved the first half, and it was beautifully directed throughout (with exceptional production design) with a man intangible fairytale feeling but I could have definitely done without the overtly romantic relationship. You could have removed the sex scenes, kept everything else the same, and it wouldn't have lost any of its specialness.","The Shape of Water",8880,4.2,0.2
"8881",5,"  Beautiful in every sense of the word. Guilermo del Toro does a wonderful job that shows not only the good in the world, but also the bad. The soundtrack of the film is absolutely haunting, and adds to the beautiful narrative that is presented. One of the best films I've ever seen.","The Shape of Water",8881,4.2,-0.8
"8882",4,"  I've been waiting to watch this film since its announcement, long before all the nominations in the various award ceremonies started making headlines. Imagine my surprise when I heard it was nominated for a ""Best Picture"" award from The Academy. As rare an occasion as they come because The Academy tends to not bother with films of such nature. Needless to say, my excitement to watch it grew exponentially. Unfortunately, 20 minutes in, I realized the film was clearly selected as a nominee for all the wrong reasons. Films should not have to be praising the things of old, the old era & old Hollywood in order to suck up to people in power & vice versa. People in power should know better than to be affected by elements such as these. It's the same cliche over & over again. Now when it comes to the movie itself, it's actually really good. Hawkins definitely steals the show by making something so absurd & inconceivable look believable & even lovable. Jenkins is brilliant as Giles & has justifiably snatched a ""supporting actor"" nomination though Spencer's nomination is rather questionable. She is fine in the film but does not provide anything spectacular or jaw-dropping, she is just a good supporting actress, nothing more. Del Toro's shots are often so mesmerizing you just want to pause & regard them & Desplat's music flows majestically through the film's dreamy sequences. The noir element is ever-present & Shannon elevates & glorifies it with his stellar performance as the film's villain.(Updated from 20/02/2018)","The Shape of Water",8882,4.2,0.2
"8883",0.5,"  This movie is really bad. Apparently all white straight men are evil, and all minorities, women and gay people are angels. American white straight men are the worst, of course, and the 50's and 60's should not be thought of with any positive nostalgia. That's it. That's how Del Toro wants us to think, apparently. Wow. It's just dumb","The Shape of Water",8883,4.2,3.7
"8884",5,"  Ho amato la delicatezza di questa pellicola, il rapporto fra la creatura (aspetto incredibile e recitazione magistrale) ed Elisa da sempre prigioniera di un mondo silenzioso.Guillermo Del Toro ci ha finalmente regalato un lieto fine!","The Shape of Water",8884,4.2,-0.8
"8885",4.5,"  I thought this a very surprising, interesting and at times down right magical. Superb cast, magnificent music and a eclectic vision of a special world. Highly recommend to classic movie goers","The Shape of Water",8885,4.2,-0.3
"8886",4,"  Artistically this film is fantastic. Every space is like its own character with its own mood and atmosphere. A lot of it has to do with light, whether it's the dimly lit hallway of Elisa's apartment, her bus rides in the twighlight, or harsh fluorescent lighting of the laboratory. This is the world in which the characters dwell. Outcasts of society - a mute woman, a gay man, an African American woman (to an extent), and a merman like creature - they find friendship and support and love in each other. The movie is a love story and a little bit of a thriller and a visual poem. But I feel that in order to fully appreciate it one needed to be fully immersed, and I kept getting thrown out. One problem was that as a native Russian speaker I found Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian hilarious and thus distracting. I also thought the whole Russian story line was rather wobbly, like it was there just to serve a purpose. Another element that felt contrived was the presence of three scars on Elisa's neck. The explanation they offered accounted for one scar, the other two seemed to be there for the sole purpose of being transformed at the end. The relationship between Elisa and the creature was beautiful, but I had to squash my queasiness when it went sexual. I mean, yes, he was intelligent and sensitive, and could sit at the table like a person eating his beloved eggs, but he wasn't human. Was it really necessary? And lastly, maybe that's just me and my dislike of gore, but was the last scene with the fingers necessary?The ending was really beautiful. I just wish I could stay with the film the whole time.","The Shape of Water",8886,4.2,0.2

"8892",1.5,"  Yet another La La Land in which the critics are bribe and cajoled into giving over zealous reviews of cheap mediocre films, La La Land got 98% ripe tomatoes when in reality it was 5 out of 100 at best at least this sorry excuse for a movie is probably 55% as opposed to the 92% being banded about.

"8902",4.5,"  This film is quite special for me. It's the first film (aside from standard Marvel/Star Wars etc. films) that I've actually been excited for, and anxiously awaiting it's release. Since it came out in America first, I also heard how good many people thought it was.Now, I haven't watched nearly as much of Guillermo Del Toro's work as I would have liked, and that's something i'm working to change, but I've enjoyed everything I've seen that he was linked to. This is the first of his works that I've seen in the cinema, and at this rate, he may end up as one of my favourite directors. Everything he does has tremendous style, whether it's a surreal 1960s romance featuring a fish man, or monoliths of metal and monsters clashing. Of course, The Shape of Water looks gorgeous despite it's relatively small budget of 19 million dollars. Despite how much I enjoyed Black Panther, TSoW had a budget 1/10th of the size and in my opinion, looked better. The creature effects were brilliant, and Del Toro captured the feel of the setting wonderfully. The music was quite gorgeous, and fit the setting remarkably. The soundtrack sounds like songs you might have heard at the time. It also captures much of the morbid whimsy the film holds throughout.Speaking of morbidity, I was surprised by the violence throughout the film. Despite my excitement for it's release, I'd never actually noted it's rating. I'd assumed it to be a PG-13 or something of the sort, but it holds (and earns) a hard R rating. The gore was almost distractingly good, and depending on the scene somebody watches, they could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a horror film.Surprisingly, I enjoyed every performance in the film. Sally Hawkins made good on a tremendous task; her character Elisa is mute throughout the film, and as a result, all of ehr acting must be done through body language and facial expression. This fact, coupled with the older setting, often reminded me of the classic silent films. Octavia Spencer also does wonderfully, and the duo have great chemistry despite the lack of words between the pair. Richard Jenkins also brought some much needed levity to many situations, while Michael Shannon gave our antagonist legitimate vulnerability, keeping him from remaining a simple, bland villain.Every character is interesting in their own way, and it's quite interesting seeing how this group of outcasts interacts with one another all throughout. There is a mute woman, a black lady, a gay gentleman, a Russian spy and a literal fishman, yet they all feel more human than our villain, despite how the world of the film may portray them.The plot, for the most part, is rather odd though I imagine this was intentional. The whole film feels rather akin to a fairytale, albeit a far more mature one with nudity and blood. Many times throughout the film, I felt extremely uncomfortable, though I feel this was the intended reaction; it really added to the scene, and the film overall. Even though I could tell the vague direction of the plot from the trailer alone, I wasn't at all disappointed after watching the film. The journey to the destination was far more important in this instance. I imagine you could even watch this film chopped up and reassembled in the wrong order; it looks simply gorgeous.Though, of course, I may be biased due to how excited I was for this film, I struggle to find many flaws with it. It just seems to have clicked with me, and at the risk of rating two films extremely highly right next to each other, I shall give this film a 9.5/10, especially due to it's budget. I don't give it a 10 simply because there was a few scenes which didn't land for me, though others seemed to enjoy them.","The Shape of Water",8902,4.2,-0.3

"8908",5,"  The Shape of Water is an excellent film. It is about a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature in the 1960s. Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer give fantastic performances. The screenplay is well written. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job directing this movie.

"8912",5,"  Cute. Maybe too much.","The Shape of Water",8912,4.2,-0.8
"8913",4.5,"  An odd, visually stunning fairytale that is also immensely endearing, & magical. It is the first time in years that Guillermo del Toro has matched his absorbing imagination with an emotionally satisfying narrative, despite handling his villain once again with largely two-dimensional, obvious hand. The cast is all-around stellar but Sally Hawkins's performance is particularly phenomenal and Richard Jenkins is perfect in his supporting role. Both in story & filmmaking, this is arguably Del Toro's finest achievement and the ""most-complete"" film of the 2017 Best Picture nominees - 9/10","The Shape of Water",8913,4.2,-0.3
"8914",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is the type of film you could go to high and think is perfectly normal and go to sober and think is totally nuts, it was still a beautiful love story, albeit insane. Depends on what your motivation for seeing the movie was. If you went in thinking it was a cold war government conspiracy movie then that's really not the main focus of the film so you may not be all that interested. yes, there is some back story relating to the russians and the USA and there is some cold war tactics and it centered around that time but it's mainly the story of an alien and a human falling in love. It's mental but strangely beautiful.","The Shape of Water",8914,4.2,-0.3
"8915",4.5,"  A delightfully constructed love letter the entire cinematic experience, and the golden era of filmmaking that inspired such talented minds that write and direct today such as Guillermo del Toro. The first time you watch this movie, you'll no doubt enjoy it. But by the second or third viewing, you'll realize The Shape of Water is del Toro's best film he's made - which is quite the statement if you're not someone who knows how great some of his earlier projects are.It leaves one with a sense of wonder, and what's most interesting is the impression that you're imbued with by the time the credits roll, which is the idea that del Toro could actually continue this upward trend and make EVEN BETTER movies; that he's perhaps only getting started...quite an impression, indeed. An instant classic, something often referred to these days, but rarely appropriated or assigned correctly. This time though the label has been earned and then some. Believe the hype. The fantastical romance with imagination may not be dead to all adults...when was the last time a work of art made us think about THAT?!?","The Shape of Water",8915,4.2,-0.3
"8916",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is a fascinating story well written and directed by Guillermo de Toro that shows the power of love and that doing the right thing and going with your instinct is usually the right thing to do. Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins all give amazing and emotional performances as well as Doug Jones playing the amphibian man. This romantic story has stunning visual work and cinematography that make the film what it is.","The Shape of Water",8916,4.2,-0.3
"8917",3,"  Guillermo del Toro has come close to perfecting his own style that can be seen in most of his movies to date; stylistic historical fantasy put together with a classic but refreshing structure. However no matter how close it comes to perfection, it's a style I've never been too big of a fan of. The Shape of Water, among his other films, all feel like they're promising something that could really immerse us and give an emotional experience, but come out feeling it hasn't quite got there (at times it gets very close, the story surrounding Giles almost made me wanting it as a movie of its own). It's definitely worth a watch, but confirms that del Toro's style isn't wasted potential but a choice I just can't get into.","The Shape of Water",8917,4.2,1.2

"8919",0.5,"  I am shocked this movie has received such acclaim. It is devoid of any real magic, full of plot holes and isn't worth your time. It attempts to gain your trust by referencing golden Hollywood classics, flounders to be deep by throwing in some Biblical references, and tries to be ""real"" by being gratuitously gritty, and instead ends up being a shallow dribble devoid of imagination.","The Shape of Water",8919,4.2,3.7

"8921",1,"  Terrible movie! The irrelevant nudity and masturbation scenes did not bother me as much as the horrible script which was chock full of negative stereotypes, grotesque personality flaws, and meaningless gruesome scenes.

"8923",0.5,"  Creature from the Black Lagoon with a big budget. Two hours of my life wasted. The best part of the experience was that ads before the feature. The movie's plot is as subtle as a brick. The bad guys all wear black hats. You have to completely suspend disbelief but for no good purpose. Hollywood has lost its mind. I can't imagine how this drivel garnered as many Academy Award nominations as it did. Clearly the PC nature of this film was playing a bigger role than something as banal as having a good storyline.","The Shape of Water",8923,4.2,3.7

"8933",3,"  Aquaman meets Cinderella! This film is one of the strangest romance fantasies I've seen in a long time. How the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" falls in love with a young mute woman, who gives him some hard-boiled eggs, plays some classical music, and she imagines dancing in a muscial film with the creature. It's a fun, interesting play on the possiblity of cross-species romance. If you can put you brain on hold, you might enjoy this movie.","The Shape of Water",8933,4.2,1.2
"8934",3.5,"  to keep it short, I thought the ""bad guy"" character was a Little forced and was given too much screen time, we get it, he's a bad person. I found this kept me from being emersied fully into this world. i would loved to have seen more of the relationship development in the laboratory.the film's music and cinematography was mesmerising i had a big smile on my face watching those beautiful scenes, i felt like i was falling in love which fully convinced me of the romantic relationship in the movie and erased any doubts in my mind about it. But some of gruesome scenes in my opinion where a little unnecessary, they overpowered the amazing romantic and magical feeling of the film.in conclusion, this film to me was a roller coater one minute im falling in love, and the next im feeling uncomfortable by the gruesome/dark scenes","The Shape of Water",8934,4.2,0.7

"8939",1,"  One the worst movies I've seen! I walked out and asked for my money back. Sad because it had potential to be really good. It wasn't a movie about love at all... more like lust for a fish man. It was gory and disturbing. How could anyone want to get down with a fish man who's scales are decaying and flaking off? Then there's the mean boss with the rotten hand... just gross! Don't waste your money! If you really want to see it wait until it's for rent at the library.","The Shape of Water",8939,4.2,3.2
"8940",5,"  I believe now that the fish man saves her. Not the other way around. She was an evolved fish. The meeting was not really random because the fish man was a god. Great film","The Shape of Water",8940,4.2,-0.8

"8942",5,"  This movie was really well done. It is not very often that we can find a movie that involves a love story between a human woman and a male sea creature. There is still quite a bit of violence in this movie. Sally Hawkins character is wonderful.","The Shape of Water",8942,4.2,-0.8
"8943",5,"  Essential cinema, an instant classic in my eyes. 20 years from now everyone will be saying you need to watch this (all those top 100 films before you die kinda thing!).

"8947",0.5,"  It would have been a pretty good movie if it didn't have any of the following.- Showing the naked body in a bath scene is always unnecessary. We all have an imagination and I would rather use mine. -I don't think it's at all interesting or necessary to show someone masturbating. If they had left that out, the whole love scene with the creature would have been less gross and disgusting. And more innocent and beautiful. This backfired of them. - The animal cruelty. I cannot believe that they got away with having the creature eat the cat. And that they showed the cat's half eaten body. This was just wrong. Why couldn't they have stopped the creature before the cat got attacked?? Once again cruelty and images that were simply UNNECESSARY. - The way the sex scene with the security guy and his wife was filmed was also just really pointless. They couldn't have been under the blanket? Come on!It's always sad to see how all of the things that made the movie rated R, also ruined the whole experience. Because of the things I mentioned above, the movie lost its beauty. Nothing was even as funny as it could have been. I was just waiting for the movie to be over so I could find out how it ends.

Yet I was not satisfied with this film especially all the hype about it. The concept of the film was original and the storytelling was good, but I felt uncomfortable while watching and wasn't mesmerized and gripped by the story as I hoped to be, I only felt disappointed if anything about the story.","The Shape of Water",8958,4.2,2.2
"8959",4,"  A POETIC PORTRAIT OF LOVEUnder the signature of the acclaimed Mexican director, Guillermo del Toro, The Shape of Water introduces us to a universe set in Baltimore (United States), during the Cold War period. With a unique aesthetic and under a green light filter, we witness a narrative that faithfully portrays the human species and its mechanisms of marginalization, where aspects such as belonging and loneliness, love and death are combined in a fantastic fable.At the beginning of the film, the director invites us to enter to the private life of Elisa Esposito, a young woman who lives in a small apartment above a movie theater, to which life is solitary and routine. Every day she makes the same trip by train to her work; a government laboratory designed to investigate and develop tools to combat the war. There she spends her working day accompanied by Zelda, an African-American woman who shares her marital problems while cleaning the laboratory facilities.During her free time, she shares lots of sweet pie with Giles, a frustrated illustrator who does not find recognition with his works, and is constantly questioned about his sexual orientation.However, one day Elisa's reality seems to break down, and little by little she finds herself involved in a special relationship with a captive being that means a danger (or an advantage) for the group of scientists.Where she begins to recognize herself in him, and he in her, as beings capable of achieving a unique and special communication, devoid of speech but enriched by movement and music. Because at the end of the day, both are social phenomena, locked in and forced to stay out of a society that excludes them because of their uniqueness and uses them to the extent of their functionality.This is how Richard Strickland, the antagonistic character is forced to kill the amphibian, hastening Elisa to draw up a rescue plan, which will have the help of a Russian spy scientist, and that will lead to the coexistence of both on the floor of her apartment, bringing a host of inconveniences that will further narrow their relationship, moving the link to the more carnal aspects of relationships.Finally, we must not forget that it is not accidental that the director has included the presence of a cinema, so close to our protagonist, who, along with the stories told there, lives in a dream world, where everything is possible, mainly extraordinary love","The Shape of Water",8959,4.2,0.2
"8960",1,"  I love original film, especially the ones that challenge the viewer and even offend many (mother! last year is a great example). This, while definitely original, is just a very bad film in general. Creating a sexual romance between a human and a fishman just.. did not work for me at all. I felt absolutely nothing for either of these characters because we're given nothing to care about, other than the fact that they feel alone. A+ writing right there! The plot is offensively predictable, and so, so dull. It has quite possibly one of the worst endings to a film I have ever seen. Dreadful. Watch at your own risk.","The Shape of Water",8960,4.2,3.2

"8974",1,"  I'm with critic Rex Reed. I saw this at the Napa Valley Film Festival. I left 10 minutes before it was over. A ""nice, lovable"" monster having sex with a mute? The real monster in the movie reinforced that we have enough real life monsters in our lives! I couldn't take another minute of this one!

We were fascinated that everyone decides the creature is a male when there is no visible evidence of wedding tackle. Luckily for the heroine, he has, as she explains to all of us pondering this mystery, some sort of retractable trouser snake, which appears concealed behind some sort of sliding door arrangement. If l had been her l would have checked this out first. But then she does appear to have pretty low standards in her choice of men.

"8978",4.5,"  Thanks to its deeply immersive production design, gorgeous imagery, one deeply emotional and thought-provoking story about love, xenophobia, political interests and moral ambiguity, profound symbolism, a stellar cast led by one outstading Sally Hawkings and Alexandre Desplat's wonderful score, Guillermo del Toro's romantic drama ""The Shape of Water"" easily stands out as one of the best films of 2017.","The Shape of Water",8978,4.2,-0.3
"8979",5,"  amazing. acting is beautiful, cinematography is wonderfully done. in my opinion, it's a must see.","The Shape of Water",8979,4.2,-0.8
"8980",4,"  Finally I got around to see the shape of water. Its full of wonderful performances, sharp screenplay and supreme visuals. It has some charming characters. It has some awkward moments for sure but that is just part of the charm and innocence. My only criticism is the rushed and fairytale like ending. This should have been better explained. Still very nice cinema and a wonderful story.","The Shape of Water",8980,4.2,0.2
"8981",5,"  The Shape of Water tells a beautiful story that breaks your heart and heals it. It is a little on the nose, with cut-out-for-children morals and almost caricatures of characters, but it WORKS.","The Shape of Water",8981,4.2,-0.8
"8982",4,"  Beautiful movie well crafted a fairytail on an adult level!","The Shape of Water",8982,4.2,0.2
"8983",4.5,"  Rarely, a movie so bizarre, so dark sometimes and so fantastic like only Guillermo del Toro can do, can be simultaneasly so romantic and beautiful. ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the most beautiful romances f 2017 and of the decada. Del Toro shined in the direction chair and created one of his best. Sally Hawkins plays one of the most passioning characters of the year, Michael Shannon is just pure evil, Richard Jenkis is extremely kind and Octavia Spencer is absolutely hilarious. A Cold War drama like we never watched before. Love each other, people!","The Shape of Water",8983,4.2,-0.3
"8984",0.5,"  Awful movie...period!","The Shape of Water",8984,4.2,3.7
"8985",5,"  A cherish-able treat for film fans. This entrancing visual spectacle bubbles with a delightful mystery. It celebrates love and individual difference through the well-told story's wholesome characters, all superbly performed.","The Shape of Water",8985,4.2,-0.8
"8986",4,"  Visually mesmerising. A couple of clue scenes that are so vividely impressed in my mind. Octavia Spencer and Sally Hawkins are incredibly talented. The plot is so, so but the characters make up for all that was missing in the depth of the story. Vote: 7.5","The Shape of Water",8986,4.2,0.2
"8987",3,"  'The Shape Of Water' feels like the realization of a del Toro fan-fiction that spawned somewhere between Hellboy and Pacific Rim. The drawback is that not much of the movie feels original. and most of the rest seems staged and overly dramatized, going out of its way to break my suspension of disbelief. The stars of the show are the romantic focus of the story: they do an amazing job of feeling authentic and passionate, making the bizarre love aspect my absolute favourite part of the film. It's kind of sad though that it was so underutilized. Either way, the movie does a good enough job of not being a wreck, and amid all the cliche cutout characters and the eye-roll-inducing quoting of Bible verses, there's a decent, heartwarming story.","The Shape of Water",8987,4.2,1.2
"8988",3.5,"  Less is more... a rich, detailed mounting. Sally Hawkins is quiet, confident and ably supported by Richard Jenkins and the rest of the cast.","The Shape of Water",8988,4.2,0.7
"8989",1,"  How does this movie have 92% movie full of naked / sex references that brings nothing to the movie. Intercourse woman / manfish? close to zoophilia ! This was carp (got the joke?)","The Shape of Water",8989,4.2,3.2
"8990",0.5,"  It was the most disturbing movie I ever saw.It was a struggle to watch until the end.I didn't like it at all. I found it completely out of logic or meaning.I hate this movie.","The Shape of Water",8990,4.2,3.7
"8991",4.5,"  Some of Del Toro's best directing. Only issue is Eliza and The Amphibian Man's relationship felt a little one-sided, and I needed more of a personality from him. But the more they give him, the more risk of him becoming a stock/cliched character, so I understand they were cautious about that.","The Shape of Water",8991,4.2,-0.3
"8992",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro once again brings his love for monster horror and makes it naturally sweet. What this film does is develop certain characters scene by scene, in no small part by the performances by Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, and especially Doug Jones as the one creature. And the heavy-handed Cold War ideas that were prevalent make it all the more fitting for the chance to sympathize - and fall in love - with what is essentially a B-movie monster.","The Shape of Water",8992,4.2,-0.8
"8993",0.5,"  King Kong with Russians. This is what happens when you have wonderful set designers, a great cinematographer but no story. Avoid this drivel.","The Shape of Water",8993,4.2,3.7
"8994",3,"  Yes, this is a beautifully-crafted love story, the colors are stunning, the acting is generally solid (not incredible, though, but read on for more on that), and there is some curious magic to an inter-species sex scene. But, I have just covered all that is great about this film. The rest is simply good. Sally Hawkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer were all good-to-very-good, depending on the scene. And I'm also a big fan of all of them, it should be said. But man, were they all actiiiiiiiiiiing. The only great performance in the movie was Richard Jenkins, who surprised the hell out of me. Otherwise, acting as well as the writing both made me like I was watching a movie, not being immersed into this great, modern Fairy Tale that everyone is talking about. The Shape of Water is Oscar bait (pardon the pun) at its core and it is likely to be rewarded as such despite being a highly derivative story and borrowing its entire style from video games of the past (e.g. BioShock). This is a good movie and this is bound to be a safe year for the Oscars as they go in cycles. It's the perfect, glittery follow-up winner to the raw Moonlight, which won out over glitter-bomb La La Land last year. A final note: Can we talk about how we know nothing about the relationship between Hawkins and Jenkins' characters and never find out anything out about the Monster outside of him being inexplicably friendly towards a mute girl?","The Shape of Water",8994,4.2,1.2
"8995",0.5,"  just a rehashing of Pan's Labyrinth. Virtually identical in every way.","The Shape of Water",8995,4.2,3.7

"8999",5,"  A truly beautiful story and movie. Guillermo del Toro is a genius.","The Shape of Water",8999,4.2,-0.8
"9000",2,"  I love art house movies! But not this one. Being arty just for the sake of being artistic works to get Oscar nominations, apparently. It does not work for me. The story is an indirect copy of the amazing French movie 'Amelie' with a sea monster added. If characters are not well introduced they will not get sympathy from the audience. I didn't feel anything for the fake love story between the protagonist and the monster, because it was based on nothing. Great cast and of course great acting from experienced actors, but if the story is not right it doesn't elevate, it doesn't move and it will not inspire you. Let's be honest, that's what we all look for in a movie. The committee of the Oscars must have had a hard time making choices. The selection seems to be a confusing one, from intense love dramas to fantasy stories without depth. If this movie wins more than 1 Oscar the credibility of the ceremony will be under fire, as it is every year. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter","The Shape of Water",9000,4.2,2.2
"9001",5,"  this was a sleeper hit I thought it was great loved Doug Jones as the creature","The Shape of Water",9001,4.2,-0.8
"9002",3.5,"  The movie has very good visuals. I think the under eye level camera shooting was fantastic cinematography. It was tight and in your face. The acting was spot on. I loved the film but for the plot - the plot was very simple and has been. Good cinema, yet not powerful.","The Shape of Water",9002,4.2,0.7
"9003",4.5,"  I thought it was beautiful, well-crafted, and original. Cinematography was beautifully shot, it was well acted all around. This is an instant classic. Possibly Guillermo's best movie.","The Shape of Water",9003,4.2,-0.3
"9004",3,"  Hard to buy into this plot, but it's another story of a woman that can see past physical attraction and fall in love.","The Shape of Water",9004,4.2,1.2
"9005",4.5,"  This is a beautiful, love story combining fantasy with reality. I was mesmerized for two hours. I love Sally Hawkins and this movie doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb. It is a true good vs evil story, where I found that I was rooting for an Amazonian monster, believing he was real. See this movie with a group of friends and save time for discussion after the film. There are so many layers to this film. I am so grateful that I saw it, I can't wait to see how it does on Oscar night.","The Shape of Water",9005,4.2,-0.3
"9006",3,"  This film is certainly 'different' and that seems to get the high scores on Rotten Tomatoes. But that does not mean it's always brilliant. I saw this one at the Cinema, but probably should have waited for the DVD. Quite good, but watching this one time is enough.","The Shape of Water",9006,4.2,1.2

"9010",1,"  Not so subtle attack on American culture. Whites bad, blacks good; men weak or cruel, women intelligent and brave; American government bad, Russian scientist compassionate. Heterosexual characters seen as obtuse and mean, while homosexual characters portrayed as caring and loving. Married father is distant and self absorbed and seeking extramarital affair, while single female is portrayed as loyal. The name of the movie should have been called ""I hate white, heterosexual, patriotic gun owning males"".","The Shape of Water",9010,4.2,3.2
"9011",4,"  A bizarre story but a great film and well worth all the Oscar nominations. Eliza is a mute janitor at a top secret government building holding a sea creature found in South America. She becomes curious and gains actress to the lab. Slowly she grows fond of the creature and builds a friendship with the help of eggs, sign language and music. When she heard they plan to kill the monster she plans to help it escape with the help of friends Zelda and Giles and houses the creature at her house and and to set him free. Very enjoyable tender love story of a mute woman and sea creature who find they have a lot in common. Very imaginative film from Guillermo del Toro","The Shape of Water",9011,4.2,0.2

Gorgeous?Beatiful?Spectacular?Or the three together?The Shape Of Water is a film that can transmit beatiful emotions, in a very simple way.We recognize the ""Fish"" as an human, and we can the understand the fury of the villain, and the love of the protagonistThe 13 nominations for the Oscars are understandable, so as the great critic response..It can be sometimes boring, for those who don't care much about emotions and art.The Shape of Water can be funny, or be the most cruel movie of the world, but Del Toro can balance both very well, great perfomances, musics and great story.","The Shape of Water",9015,4.2,-0.3
"9016",4,"  Spielbergian in its setting and atmosphere, 'Shape of Water' is a bewitching blend of fantasy, romance and spy thriller. GDT has created something instantly memorable.","The Shape of Water",9016,4.2,0.2
"9017",4,"  I ended up watching this movie as I am a huge fan of Doug Jones (Star Trek-Discovery, Hellboy,...) and Guillermo del Toro.

"9018",3.5,"  First class del toro, Amelie crosses with pans labyrinth, with a very stylish 1960s Cold War look. Always rated sally hawkins since happy go lucky, but I am pleased and at the same time amazed that she was picked for this role over any other Hollywood ubiquitous actress.

"9024",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro made Pan's Labyrinth, which in my humble opinion is one of the greatest films ever made. This isn't tehre, but it's very good. An achingly beautiful story about alienation, love and loneliness. It's cinematically gorgeous, as you would expect from Del Toro, and the acting is splendid throughout.","The Shape of Water",9024,4.2,-0.8
"9025",5,"  a totally different movie than what is playing right now. I totally enjoyed it and I've seen it two times.","The Shape of Water",9025,4.2,-0.8
"9026",4,"  4/5 Guillermo Del Toro is, in my opinion, one of the greatest directors out there especially when it comes to creature features. I've seen all of his films and loved every single one. This one is along the lines of The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. A fantastic drama about a woman who falls in love with an amphibian man who looks an awful lot like Abe Sapien from Del Toro's Hellboy films. Overall this movie was a fantastic, almost throwback to Del Toro's earlier, less action oriented films.","The Shape of Water",9026,4.2,0.2

"9029",4,"  The Shape of Water is a surprisingly engrossing romantic fantasy tale, and is a visual treat. Sally Hawkins gives an impressive performance as the mute cleaner who works a highly secretive government laboratory. The ensemble cast is top class, but Michael Shannon is simply brilliant as the antagonist - the civil servant and government agent - and makes you wonder who's really the true monster. He's the actor to watch! A work of ambitious direction, as the following themes are played out: isolation vs freedom; deception vs truth; lust vs love. I especially enjoyed the different levels of loyalties being played out and tested. Absorbing and enjoyable.","The Shape of Water",9029,4.2,0.2

"9033",4,"  While the movie starts out rather strangely, with two masturbation scenes and one overdrawn sex scene in the first thirty minutes, it becomes a genuinely enchanting experience. The new, more adult, romance between a human and a monster completely overshadows the pure cliche-fest of Beauty and The Beast. The finale is perfectly played out, with the relatable anti-hero meeting his doom and the heroine getting her wish. Underlying tones, such as racial issues and discrimination against women in the workforce, and a charming story, make this one of Del Toro's best movies.","The Shape of Water",9033,4.2,0.2
"9034",5,"  Intresting plot really makes us think about life after watching defenitly recommending it.","The Shape of Water",9034,4.2,-0.8
"9035",1.5,"  Or the return of the Creature of the black Lagoon. 64 years later, the shape of water fits well in the category of a B movie from the 1950s, but with expensive taste: the classic cold war characters, the misunderstood and exploited class, the oppressive elites... and among all this, a surprising love. Visually recreating faithfully the atmosphere of the late 1950s-early 1960s, del Toro mixes the 1950s B movie monster genre with magic realism. The result is not a success. Characters are flat although well acted, dialogues are obvious, and except for a few moments, the 2h movie feels loooong. I wanted to empathise but after waiting too long, I got bored. How it has been nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.","The Shape of Water",9035,4.2,2.7

Emotional and heartwarming with a sprinkle of dark, funny and ""magic"" moments, the film is entertaining and good throughout.","The Shape of Water",9039,4.2,-0.3
"9040",4.5,"  The Shape Of Water is an emotional tale of lonely people and outsiders meeting each other, disguised as an exquisite romance between two people incapable of speech. The fact that this was made for $20 million is a testament to the producers as this looks like it would rather have cost $100 million. Sally Hawkins gives a fantastic performance, as does Octavia Spencer, and the two make a perfect mash. Richard Jenkins also served as a subtle comedic relief, that actually worked, and stayed integral to the plot. For me, personally, Michael Stuhlbarg was the stand out character. The fact that del Toro can handle a Soviet spy in such a respectful, and understanding way, without having him fall into any kind of clichés that a less skilful director would resort to. The creature effects, as is in character for del Toro, were excellent. The use of colour throughout was fairy-tale lack, giving the story a certain enchantment. While no elements of the score particularly stood out to me, I still remember in particular silent scenes, that it carried the entire emotional drive. The cinematography gave such a wide breadth of 1962 America and completely sucked one into the environment. The only error that I could point out throughout was Michael Shannon's character, who was an incredible missed opportunity, for yet another lonely person seeking real love in this world. I have never been more convinced of two character's love for each other in my life. A fantastic film by a fantastic visionary.","The Shape of Water",9040,4.2,-0.3

"9044",3.5,"  Grade: A-Rating: R, 119 minutesIn a Nutshell: Certified fresh! This ""adult fairy tale"" was produced, directed, and written by Guillermo Del Toro. The film combines a love story with science fiction and Cold War drama. Some critics have likened it to Beauty And The Beast meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. It's odd, for sure.This film has received more Oscar nominations than any other film! Many of them are technical noms. We'll see how many they win.Tips for parents: This movie is rated R for a reason. It's not appropriate for children's viewing.A LOT of full frontal nudity of a woman. Another woman opens her shirt to reveal her bare chest.Woman pleasures herself in a bathtubCrude language, F-bombs, and profanityYou see a married couple have sex.You learn sign language for some words.RacismHomosexualityHypocrisy Hope, compassion, humanityUplifting theme: Feeling incomplete and unfulfilled in life and how we fill that void.Love can't be defined.Humanity, outsidersFriendship, loyaltyThings I liked:Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance with no words. Guillermo Del Toro said that he wrote the movie with only her in mind. Her character's last name is ""Esposito"" which is Italian, given to orphaned children, meaning ""exposed"" or ""abandoned.""Michael Shannon is fantastic, as always. He successfully makes you hate his guts. The talented ensemble also includes Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, and Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer.Some people watch a classic scene from a Shirley Temple movie. Music and dance play a role in the movie.Beautiful production design with incredible colors. It uses practically every shade of green.I loved the Old Hollywood nods to lots of other movies.A surprising musical number.Doug Jones spent three hours every day to get into his costume.Things I didn't like:Way too much nudity, awkward sex, and crude language.The end is pretty predictable.A bit of a creepy love affair.Interesting lines:""He's not even human."" - Giles (Richard Jenkins)""If we do nothing, neither are we."" - Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins)""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans."" - Daily Thought""I'm not a good liar...except Bruster.

When what places we see sounds for another day in our comforting life we see it's time to get up. When we don't see what other places are discomforting to know what sounds those bring when it's time to fight crime.*When we see what brings all sights, sounds, comforts of life in one place and time that takes us to other places more comforting. When we see what place and time it is to know all discomforts we may face being who we are in a man's world that puts us out of place. When we see what places those hold for us when the time is strict that puts us out of the workplace to know what discomforts we live by. When we see its always comforting to have those in the same place as we are amongst those in high places to know how time flys with those by our side. When we see what place others rather be when it's home to see all comforting places & time we are put in our place. When we see what place we make time for when it is comforting, to make such places routine when we have to be in other places less comforting to make time for the place that takes us to other comforting places. When we see what place could use our time and company when it's places of comfort that others don't have time to go see when busy places don't have time for timeless places like movie theatres. When we see what places others enjoy when it's being served, having everything prepared and handed to them when the time of full functionality in the workplace keeps everyone in place and time to know what comforts those on top keep an eye on and discomforts of those who are being watched need to abide to. When we see what places that come from higher places to see what such places has to offer, we see a time of discomfort when the world is in competition from business to politics to know what such discomfort brings to deliver the next technological revolution. When we see it is always great to share what we see is comforting with others who share what is comforting to know what place we share in common that the world doesn't see, when the time of change pushes power ahead of powerless that we see transitioning from one time to another we lose such places. When we see what place those will lose to only break them out, when old places and new places are no longer wanted that they find themselves in a time where higher places wish to move forward to a more comforting place in weaponry to protect what discomforts us, threats from our enemies. When we see that there is no place and time moving forward with those who we share such comforting place with we see what we must protect to get out. When we see what place we go to protect those from threats we see that time only puts those in discomfort when it isn't real and we see a comforting time turn discomforting when we see ourselves as threatening to the world when our actions in the pursuit of power dehumanizes us. When we see living in such comforting places of promise, we see it's compromised when it comes at the cost of other places when time reveals all scars and lack of authenticity in the places we live in, that it becomes discomforting to know it's not real. When we see the only place that we can share such places with those that share in the comforts of natural places we see what time will takes us, when it's hidden, below those who are shallow, and in discomforting places that we need to get used to.When we don't always see how great advancements come to be that we see that we put many in discomfort for the pursue of science when time & competition was a stake to know what comforts we enjoy today came from those we thank. When we see time has always made discomforting patterns in all places before comfort is restored to know we have to accept discomfort when building a comfortable world. When we see a discomforting time where women are put in their place we expect them to abide by a men's place to not see if such places applys to any men why not fishmen?","The Shape of Water",9060,4.2,-0.8
"9061",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is an ingenious fantasy romance that utilizes cold war era elements to the advantage of its premise while subtly challenging our preconceived notions of established archetypes.Del Toro has an innate understanding of portraying beauty of purity in all it's forms while simultaneously showing us the grotesque underbelly and brutality of what it is to be human.These skills help him build a boy meets girl (or girl meets creature xP) fairytale with a believable yet dynamic supporting cast.The story is equal parts gripping as it is touching, overcoming it's formulaic approach by using unlikely characterization and story elements that come seamlessly together. Adding the films success to his repertoire definitely showcases Del Toro's ability to adapt and excel in multiple genres.","The Shape of Water",9061,4.2,-0.3
"9062",5,"  I loved it, I simply did. Guillermo del Toro's latest feature has so much soul and heart that elevate this story to other levels. ""The Shape Of Water"" is an otherwordly experience and the movie that made me finally fall for del Toro's style. A very unique story,a very poetic story, a beautiul fairytale. So many themes hidden in this movie,so many subtle points were made. Sally Hawkins dazzled me with her performance, she was magnificent! All performances were exceptional but hers and Jenkins' brought so much soul to their characters. A really great movie!","The Shape of Water",9062,4.2,-0.8
"9063",1,"  Jesus H, that was the most bizarre film I think I've ever watched. It was like a mix between Amelie and Beauty and the Beast, which might be acceptable, at least, were it not for the fact that a) the beast looked like a mutant lizard fish out of predator, b) Amelie didn't have the good sense not to have intercourse with it, three times c) we were reliably informed by the lead actress (who had to use hand gestures because she couldn't speak) that the predator's 'funangulator' sprouted from behind its pelvic bone. Call me over imaginative, but a 'funangulator' sprouting from a space more commonly designated (in humans) for a female's 'trunundular' is surely never going to be pretty, heaven forbid 'sexy'?! If you can magnanimously put the beastiality that gradually blossoms between these two creatures to one side - which, call me old fashioned, never seemed to quite go away (but rather kept haemorrhaging, perhaps in syncopation with the beasts throbbing funangulator) - I don't think I can say I've ever watched a film that has moved me so violently back and fore between gripping humanity to such disturbing depravity so quickly within the space of two hours in my entire life. It was like experiencing life with a split personality disorder. I couldn't watch the grizzly bits either, but it was clearly a powerful movie and well acted. My only wish would be to see some of the outtakes of the actors describing the funangulator. It must have caused a few laughs; if not made them question whether anything in the film was 'right'? America concerns me sometimes. How did they even..? Ugh","The Shape of Water",9063,4.2,3.2
"9064",0.5,"  Pornographic filth - poorly written and uninteresting.","The Shape of Water",9064,4.2,3.7
"9065",4.5,"  The Shape of Water basically has it all, a great story, stunning visuals, superb acting and a sweeping soundtrack. Furthermore, It's not that often that B stories are so well woven into the main plot and that every single set-up has a satisfying pay-off. To sum it up, Del Torro's vision applied to a modern day faery tale is a near perfect match.","The Shape of Water",9065,4.2,-0.3
"9066",5,"  Best film Ive seen for ages, interesting, silly and just fun to watch, some critics are so full of their own importance they seem to forget about entertainment!","The Shape of Water",9066,4.2,-0.8
"9067",4.5,"  The love story between a non-human fish God and a mute human was seen and seen again over the past decades, but Del Toro has a unique way of telling a story and it's poetic.The choice of the actors is amazing and having a non-speaking first role practically reinvent the story telling.The image is amazing and I had a really good time watching this movie.","The Shape of Water",9067,4.2,-0.3
"9068",5,"  Great! Inspiring movie about the power of love.","The Shape of Water",9068,4.2,-0.8
"9069",2,"  The Shape Of Water is a derivative, uncomfortable, snoozefest with an overly gratuitous script and directing more worthy of a high school film student than someone as accomplished as Del Toro. Some of the cinematography is worth it and the score and sound editing are fabulous.","The Shape of Water",9069,4.2,2.2
"9070",2.5,"  While the film is somewhat entertaining, I kinda wince at how the value of transgression is reduced to whether a sea creature has a penis or not so that it/he can have intercourse with a human. It makes me miss something like Under the Skin more than ever. Of course, being del Toro film, The Shape of Water can't help but displaying one-dimensional characters. Its failure to dig deep into the theme of alienation is also much expected, given that the film is less interested in that, in comparison with drawing up some senseless fantasy for the audiences to wow at.","The Shape of Water",9070,4.2,1.7
"9071",5,"  Astonishingly beautiful. At its core, a somewhat familiar story, but told in an amazingly unique and touching way. A creature film that is truly a love story. Told in the simplest yet most profound terms possible. I find increasingly that Guillermo del Toro's work now surpasses what Tim Burton's work was for me in my youth (i.e. Edward Scissorhands). A great film.","The Shape of Water",9071,4.2,-0.8
"9072",2.5,"  ...She had sex with a water monster! How is that not more disturbing and absurd with people? This utterly bizarre, really rather gross ""romance"" is probably going to win all the Oscars in the world, and I cannot for the life of me understand why. Gillermo Del Toro deserves an academy award. Absolutely. But while ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was a modern fairy tale masterpiece, this was just offsetting and creepy. Inter-species romance-I'm just not ready for it, I guess. Call me a prude, but the idea of a human actually mating with what is basically a space alien is NOT for me. But the performances were great. The cinematography, effects, lighting, costumes, sets and music were through the roof. From a technical standpoint, this film is a wonder. The actors have been rightly nominated for Oscars. For those reasons, I gave it 2.5/5 stars. But the plot was ABSURD. And the moment when a sea beast starts dancing on a '30s style bandstand is howlingly insane. I'll give it this: it was certainly memorable. And to be honest, perhaps that's enough these days. Creativity should be lauded, and this movie's going to win big at those all-important academy awards. Del Toro will be rightly recognized for his fantastic work. And so it goes.","The Shape of Water",9072,4.2,1.7
"9073",3.5,"  THE SHAPE OF WATER is a romantic fairy tale about an Amazonian River creature. The film is set during the Cold War of the early '60's with culturally attentive pragmatic attitudes and an excellent attention to detail. This film is not the fun-loving HELLBOY movies, nor the PAN'S LABYRINTH masterpiece; it is a piece of art and architecture all its own, and the production designers should receive as much credit as the director. The performances are convincing in every nuance. What this story reminds me of are stories from dolphin trainers who work with stressed dolphins that've spent too much time in captivity and need stress releases. While that comparison may sound bland, knowing characters' motivations for being in a relationship can make the relationship seem matter-of-fact; then comparatively, the neighbor's illustrations show the woman and creature's relationship as having a mythically romantic quality. It's interesting that Del Toro has the neighbor's illustrations to show that art may add romanticism to what are otherwise pragmatic and practical decisions just like this film's designs add a strangely romantic quality to the otherwise familiar story. In addition to the above, and not as an afterthought, this film is a tale of marginalized and misunderstood individuals who gain the strength from one another and from their differences to act against oppressive dominance. It's also a good reflection of how fear can create scary and violent people. Fear in the face of threats to one's values and family. While TIME magazine warns this has an interspecies sex scene, viewers who pay special attention to the mute woman's origin, having been found along a river, and scarification on the sides of her neck, along with the creature's peculiar abilities, may see the plot from a different point of view.","The Shape of Water",9073,4.2,0.7

"9077",4.5,"  My favorite movie of 2017 and maybe the only I've seen multiple times in the theatre. Del Toro's visuals, the fantastic score and a fantastic performance delivered from Sally Hawkins without having her even utter a word all tie together into the strangest and most delightful cold war love story to ever exist.","The Shape of Water",9077,4.2,-0.3
"9078",3,"  Just so-so, okay, nothing special by any means. Acting was very good, I like the visuals and the color of the film, it had some interesting themes and a nice mix of the sad and sweet, but ultimately I think the film was somewhat formulaic, been there done that, nothing much original. Overrated.","The Shape of Water",9078,4.2,1.2
"9079",5,"  Del Toro teki sen vihdoin... Nimittäin viiden tähden englanninkielisen elokuvan. Toimii kuin se kuuluisa junan vessa. Sally Hawkins on mahtava ja ansaitsee kaiken suitsutuksen. Sivurooleissa luottoporukkaa vaikka kuinka. ***** /5","The Shape of Water",9079,4.2,-0.8

"9083",5,"  Sally Hawkins shines beginning to end. If you require characters to care about, you will find them in this film including the water bound male lead. Despite its watery environment, SofW sizzles hotter than some of its dryer counterparts. Yes, it is primarily a watery romance but friendship takes a strong second seat. This film gives you people to love as it portrays villians to hate, I will watch this again on DVD.","The Shape of Water",9083,4.2,-0.8
"9084",1.5,"  Ridiculous movie about a mute who has sex with a lizard man in a flooded bathroom. Avoid at all costs.","The Shape of Water",9084,4.2,2.7

"9086",5,"  I would call it an impeccable reconstruction of The Beauty and the Beast, perfect soundtrack, I loved the photography, excellent performance by Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon.","The Shape of Water",9086,4.2,-0.8
"9087",4,"  del Toro's latest dark fantasy boasts an excellent cast, orchestrated by a rhythmic feel from start to finish. Sally Hawkins perfectly exudes emotion, despite her character being mute. Her performance is backed by solid turns from Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Jenkins, and an impressively dark ambiance from Michael Shannon. A complex and moving score, as well as immersive production design make the fairytale more of a vintage love story with added flare. With the complexity of characters and style, ""The Shape of Water"" falls only slightly short of perfection with an underdeveloped storyline shared between the two leading lovers.","The Shape of Water",9087,4.2,0.2
"9088",3,"  In this unusual mesh of fantasy, romance and science fiction, a mute woman working as a lab custodian in the late 60s falls for an abused, captive sea monster. The film dons many hats, several at the same time, which distract and compete for attention: that central relationship, the military's plans for the creature, a neighbor's quest to reclaim his job with an ad agency, a coworker's marriage, a supervisor's frustrated home life. Each adds a layer to the onion skin, and color to the world, but ultimately they feel like light diversions from the main course. On a technical level, it's exceptional. Guillermo del Toro's work has never been short on conceptual know-how, and The Shape of Water merely continues his habit of one-upping the preceding film. The beast itself, heavily influenced by The Creature from the Black Lagoon with a hint or two of Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy, looks fantastic. Lifelike and expressive, it's easy to buy into as a thinking, feeling participant in the story. Sally Hawkins is wonderful as the human lead, drawing inspiration from dozens of classic silent films in her flourishing role as a mousey, passionate, eloquent young woman. Set designs, too, are distinct and remarkable, from the slimy, clinical confines of the military science lab to her crusty, crumbling apartment just above an active movie theater. The plot drags, though, and more than once edges awfully close to cliche. I enjoyed it, particularly on a thematic level, but I wish it was about twenty minutes shorter.","The Shape of Water",9088,4.2,1.2
"9089",5,"  This is a gorgeous movie. A luscious cinematic confection, with a thoroughly engaging and original story made even better by the beautiful performances it hosts. Richard Jenkins was a standout for me, giving a deep humanity and humor to what could have been a mere supporting role. The actors all gave tremendous credibility to this fantastic story, and worked so very well together as an ensemble. Beautifully directed and shot, it has to be seen to be believed. So glad I saw it on the big screen.","The Shape of Water",9089,4.2,-0.8
"9090",3,"  Well acted and beautiful sets, but in the end it's just another very predictable ""Beauty and the Beast"" movie which has been done a hundred times.","The Shape of Water",9090,4.2,1.2
"9091",1.5,"  The Creature was having sex with the girl come on!!! I have no idea how the critics can think this was a great movie. The acting was good no issue their and the way it was filmed looked amazing but it was the movie itself that was bad. I understand the storyline about the girl who was kinda a little different cause she can't talk and she feels lonely see a creature who is being mistreated because he is different and misunderstood I understand .It started off okay not good but by the time the creature started having sex with the girl I couldn't help but to start shaking my head and start laughing. Also what was up with Giles trying to hit on the guy at the cafe.The director Guillermo del Toro took the whole idea from the creature from the black lagoon but put his own spin on it and took out the good parts of the movie and added a muted girl and a creature who can dance,heal people and even save life or two. They tired to save it at the end but when the girl all of a sudden grew gills like a fish just put the nail in the coffin. The critics need to be drug tested and hopefully a good director will see this be upset and get the rights to make the Creature from the black lagoon the way it was supposed to be. It will be a very long time before I go see a Guillermo del Toro movie. He's weird but not a good weird but an awful weird. I'm glad I only paid 6 dollars to see the movie!!!! even that was about 3 dollars to much.","The Shape of Water",9091,4.2,2.7
"9092",3,"  If the best a ""master storyteller"" can come up with is such a harsh drama peopled by all the current stereotypes in vogue, then we who love good stories are in trouble. What could have been a truly touching love story was marred by trite reruns of bigotry, meanness and sex in most of the characters. A disappointment.","The Shape of Water",9092,4.2,1.2
"9093",3.5,"  This film is a remarkably unique and powerful love story that has already become a classic. It was great to imagine what the creature might look down there but at the same time it all feels a little too cringeworthy. I appreciated the concept of water and the uninterrupted floating of the camera throughout the entire film. Congrats to Del Toro, still I wouldn't say this is worthy of Best Picture at the Academy Awards.","The Shape of Water",9093,4.2,0.7
"9094",5,"  Great movie, emotionally moving, action, discrimination and, in the end, redemption.","The Shape of Water",9094,4.2,-0.8
"9095",3.5,"  I get the Oscar love, its a very well directed, beautiful movie. The cinematography, editing and music are impeccable. The Cold War Era theme is nailed. The story doesn't match up to the elements though.","The Shape of Water",9095,4.2,0.7
"9096",2,"  Not what I expected from the trailer. Unnecessary violence and gore. Weird story. Disappointing","The Shape of Water",9096,4.2,2.2

"9100",4,"  It was honestly quite odd. I think I walked away from it liking it overall though. It was a beautiful looking movie and the cinematography was very good, also the actresses and actors made the characters really come to life. Once again though, it was strange, definitely a monster movie.","The Shape of Water",9100,4.2,0.2
"9101",4,"  Great movie with lots of thrills right to the end of the movie. An Oscar for best picture.","The Shape of Water",9101,4.2,0.2
"9102",5,"  Del Toro bounces back after what others would call a weak film, Crimson Peak, I enjoyed that film. This film plays out like The Creature from the Black Lagoon but is much more beautiful and a labour of love by the director. The film balances a horror film but also a mystery and love that is not commonly shared in this day and age. I'm shocked Del Toro has never made a film at Universal as he has the scope and ambition to remake the Wolfman or Frankenstein something unique. I hope this wins big as it deserves all the focus it is receiving by audiences and critics. 08-02-2018.","The Shape of Water",9102,4.2,-0.8
"9103",4,"  It pulls you back to a time with a time machine direction into a gritty, wet, cold war time that is so true it somehow brings the strange fictional ""monster"" legitimacy. Sally Hawkins and Micheal Shannon performances were Oscar worthy. How the director, Del Toto brings this plot to reality seems impossible, yet you are pulled into a reality you dont want to escape from.. One of the BEST films of the year!","The Shape of Water",9103,4.2,0.2
"9104",3.5,"  The movie started so intriguingly. This new and unusual creature, in need of the help of a strong heroine. The antagonist is gritty and easy to hate, I appreciated all the casting. However some of the scenes seemed forced. Like morning masturbation seemed unnecessary, or the uncomfortable husband& wife scene, they were not poetic or brave; just gross. At other times the movie dragged, altogether Iwould have watched again, maybe with the remote close next time.","The Shape of Water",9104,4.2,0.7
"9105",1,"  Disconnected and awkward","The Shape of Water",9105,4.2,3.2
"9106",5,"  What a visual masterpiece! Sally Hawkins was fantastic! The movie was intriguing and stunning, with pleasing music and a fairytale ending! Highly recommend!","The Shape of Water",9106,4.2,-0.8
"9107",5,"  Excellent film indeed. Stunning cinematography and a great story. A mix of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon, ""Splash"" and Beauty and the ""Beast"". The actors were quite excellent. It deserves the Academy Award nominations it has. Only one scene bothered me and that was the black and white dance scene. It interupted the film in terms of style and seemed unnecessary.","The Shape of Water",9107,4.2,-0.8
"9108",0.5,"  like a dark comedy on all hollywood favorites. Just missing a car chase. I would not see this again.","The Shape of Water",9108,4.2,3.7
"9109",4,"  Great movie, very beautiful love story!","The Shape of Water",9109,4.2,0.2
"9110",3,"  Sally Hawkins does a very good job of playing the lead and I really liked all the other characters but was not that crazy of the movie in general.","The Shape of Water",9110,4.2,1.2
"9111",2,"  A cross between Beauty and the Beast + E.T.Truly, this is a kid's storyline made ""adult"" by softcore porn and liberal violence. I'm reviewing this the this the next morning and feeling used. The plot is just a hash of downtrodden outcasts vs. Evil Establishment Males™. I will say that the acting and computer effects were very good.","The Shape of Water",9111,4.2,2.2
"9112",3,"  The Shape of Water is, as I heard, the pontential oscar winner, but I have to admit that it seemed a little overrated in my eyes. I think that in this story there isn't anything so much original, touching, heartfelting, or unpredictable. I think that what distinguish this movie of other movies with similar stories is the fact that this story is carefully well-told, the photography is amazing too and it has an amazing powerfull unexpected musical number, but despite that I found the story so predictable and vulgar that I don't think it deserves the oscar of the best picture of the year.","The Shape of Water",9112,4.2,1.2
"9113",5,"  ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. The performances in this film are brilliant, with a unique female lead who cannot speak and must communicate with sign language.One of the things that works really well in this film is the way that it takes certain genres or certain norms in film and it will flip them upside down. For instance, Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with the ""asset"" or the Amphibian man (Doug Jones), the film takes a departure from the classic monster-romance film and Elisa is the one who makes a transformation into a ""monster"" or mermaid as the case may be. This up-ends our classical representation of a monster-romance such as ""Beauty And The Beast"" in which a beast is civilized by a woman. Another thing that is done so well that other films attempt but fail to succeed in is that it calls back to different styles of performing arts. The Gene Kelly-like dream sequence that covers a large portion in the ""second act"" if you can call it that, reminds us of the time of musical theater adaptations. This is done masterfully, while not startling an audience with a palate for action and thrills. The dream-sequence is completely in sync with the tone of the rest of the film. There are certainly many more great things about this film that I could go on writing for hours - but these were the highlights whichever stood out the most to me. Go see this movie, you won't regret it!","The Shape of Water",9113,4.2,-0.8
"9114",0.5,"  This movie contrasts too many ideas that conflict with one another. He's an animal, okay. No, wait, he's intelligent, so he's humanized. Okay. No, hold on, he ate a cat, and I can't hold him responsible because he's a wild animal after all. Wait, cancel that, he's still humanized enough for sex... Oh wait, GODLIKE. Because what this story really needed was ""I can heal myself-ex-machina"".There are just other movies that handle the concepts attempted to be explored here, such as in Amelie. It just feels like the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, evidenced by some characters becoming completely irrelevant by the end, and much of the story not being fleshed out in exchange for a badmy written romance (which is ruined as soon as the cat scene shows up).And I can't even give credit to the design of the creature, because there's like, 5 things already in fantasy that look way too similar for coincidence. Watch another movie, this one isn't worth it.","The Shape of Water",9114,4.2,3.7
"9115",3,"  Just could not get into the picture. I didn't care about any of the characters and the whole romance between it/him and Elisa was not believable . The picture was also very long","The Shape of Water",9115,4.2,1.2
"9116",4,"  Solid movie. Excellent acting. Good plot.","The Shape of Water",9116,4.2,0.2
"9117",3,"  Liked the movie a lot but could not help wonder if the movie would be deserving of 13 Oscar nominations were it not for the political under tones (or were they that obvious?). All the schmucks were a left stereotyped Trumpster while all of the compassionate, loving people were a mute a black a gay and a creature who encompasses every other so-called oppressed. I'm so tired of Hollywood preachers.","The Shape of Water",9117,4.2,1.2
"9118",5,"  Del Toro revisits his Pans Labyrinth days and creates one of the most beautiful love stories ever told in cinematic history.","The Shape of Water",9118,4.2,-0.8

"9120",5,"  Sally Hawkins her usual great performance","The Shape of Water",9120,4.2,-0.8
"9121",5,"  I apologize if I'm saying too much-I normally can't stand this piss stain on the slacks of the internet website or the virtue signaling mockery it has made of movie critique. But I'm going to try my hardest nonetheless while I'm still overwhelmed with the film I just saw. I'm going to try to explain why I'm still crying after an hour after leaving the theater. The Shape of Water is perhaps one of the most perfect films ever made, at least to me. The kind in which you have a *need* to see even the credits to completion, and your feet don't work until you do. There was never a moment that felt out of place in this film--the performance by each and every actor in this film was perfection crafted by one of the most beautiful minds to have ever sat in a director's chair. I loved Elisa within two minutes of her initial presence on the screen--every moment in her daily routine revealing something about her character that words simply couldn't express. Even the scene where the actress appears completely naked serves a purpose: Elisa possesses a beauty that most people don't readily see. Her appearance is that of a reserved and timid young woman, but this scene shows us that she has features not unlike the most delicate of flowers. And later when she begins to form ties with her ""Romeo"", we see that this flower has an extremely strong stem. The performance between Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones makes you completely forget that you're seeing a mute woman have sex with a water monster-what you'll see instead is a relationship stripped away of misleading nature of words, and instead built by the subtle power of touch. I'm not sure what to say other than to congratulate every actor that brought this film to life and the crew that built it's world. Mr. del Toro, The Shape of Water is one of the greatest films I ever had the good fortune to see. Thank you for sharing it with me.","The Shape of Water",9121,4.2,-0.8
"9122",3.5,"  A love story that actually makes perfect sense. Never sloppy, though a little predictable, but the music line-up, the vintage air, and the screenplay is monumental. It draws us all back to how perplexed and entangled love is, yet it is still our refuge. I didn't like the feel of relief in the end, but it was still heart-warming and the best romantic stories in decades.","The Shape of Water",9122,4.2,0.7
"9123",4,"  The Shape of Water is an elegant throwback to classic love story that will indeed captivate your heart from the tantalizing beginning to its bitter-sweet end.","The Shape of Water",9123,4.2,0.2

"9127",4,"  it's wild but like it. very romantic.","The Shape of Water",9127,4.2,0.2
"9128",5,"  The Shape Of Water is truly what it means to create a perfect film. It's a story that would work in no other medium. No other director could make this material seem plausible, let alone phenomenal. Every actor could not have been better cast, there isn't a frame of the film that could be removed or added that would make it better.

"9133",2.5,"  If this film is supposed to be a satirical comedy then I'd have to change my rating because it's great in that regard, but if it's intention is to be a serious, romantic drama well...it falls very very far of that. Great visuals typical of del Toro films, a strong performance from Sally Hawkins and a strong middle half are the only things this movie has to offer...oh and maybe some (unintentional) laughs.","The Shape of Water",9133,4.2,1.7

I disagree with other one star reviewers that it was visually appealing and well acted. The dark hues and interior scenes were depressing and anything but appealing. Hawkins overacted several times- though if she hadn't it wouldn't have mattered. I'm so grateful we walked out mid-way as apparently rather than getting better, it actually got worse. Will never trust the TM again.","The Shape of Water",9143,4.2,3.7
"9144",1,"  E.T. for adults. This movie was very predictabe. This movie could have been very good but when it became a romance, it just became stupid. Once again Hollywood is out of touch. Of course because it has a big name producer, the critics in general must go ga-ga over it. Save your money!","The Shape of Water",9144,4.2,3.2
"9145",0.5,"  Dont see what the big hype was. ""Visually a masterpiece""? What?I was excited as i really liked pans labyrinth but this movie was weird, boring and really nothing special. I did not syphazize with neither the creature or the protagonist. Im not a fan of The fact i felt you were supposed to cheer this strange romance on.Prepping us for future bending of what society think its ok and acceptable perhaps.Also, The only one who was good in this movie was Octavia.","The Shape of Water",9145,4.2,3.7

"9150",5,"  Brilliant. Stunning. Beautiful. Guillermo is a visionary genius.Some scenes feel as though you're actually under the water. In other scenes you feel as though your heart will burst with love and heartbreak. This is an unexpected, gorgeously orchestrated Romance with touches of humor peppered throughout.The story is so unlikely but you never question it. It just works beautifully. Although the relationship between the two main characters seems familiar the obvious fact that well, he's not human...makes it enthralling to watch. Michael Shannon's character in this movie was great even though he is the ""villain"" in the movie, I couldn't help but enjoy his character. He's a wonderful actor. And can we talk about Doug Jones!? Being able to portray such deep emotions through layers of makeup and prosthetics is a testament to his genius as an actor and Del Toro no doubt recognizes that. What a duo! Just amazing.This entire film was a joy and privilege to watch.","The Shape of Water",9150,4.2,-0.8
"9151",3.5,"  I did not dislike watching this movie and I am glad that Guillermo del Toro made a movie that he loves completely. The Creature has a fantastic design and Sally Hawkins, Doug Jones, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer are great in their roles, The story being unflinchingly a love story, as well as the film not hiding from aspects like sex was bold and worked. But... how do I put this, Guillermo very much genuinely loves movies and not just Hollywood movies that celebrate the golden era and Los Angeles - but Monster films and actually good movies. Yet it's terribly obvious why this movie got 13 Oscar nods as it's elements definitely will get the Academy's socks off on how much it celebrates movies and actors and that thing. When I would have preferred that that wasn't done, if that's what it had to do for the Academy to finally recognize Guillermo del Toro for the fantastic storyteller that he is, I guess it's a necessary sacrifice. Though this brings up negative feelings - the entire Academy and critic culture needs to fall down a hole - I would say the movie is still good regardless. Maybe though some aspects didn't deserve Oscar nods - like Richard Jenkins as best supporting actor? He wasn't bad but like... 2017 had many more supporting actors more worthy of that, amongst other things. It's not a bad movie, good, but great would be a stretch. The movie does have the best big lipped aligator moment though that might be my favorite scene. You'll know it when you see it and despite how ridiculous it is, despite how it's clearly giving the Oscars and Academy and Hollywood a handjob, it works because of the good writing of the film that makes a love story between a freaky fish guy and a mute woman work.","The Shape of Water",9151,4.2,0.7
"9152",4.5,"  This film lives up to its hype. It fits well with the popular theme of what it means to be human, but does this in a unique way as compared to others, like the resurgence of Blade Runner. Not only is this film aesthetically beautiful, the writing is incredible and Sally Hawkins' performance is compelling. A must see","The Shape of Water",9152,4.2,-0.3
"9153",5,"  This movie captures a spark that brings you into this world. It's a fairy tale like none before. Guillermo del Torros's directing is so creative that it makes you believe that the creature is a real person and not a monster. Though she barley speaks Sally Hawkins' makes you fell for her character and root for them survive.","The Shape of Water",9153,4.2,-0.8

"9160",2.5,"  Guillermo Del Toro's entry to this years Oscar is a fantasy romantic drama set in 1960. It is more like a fairy tale like beauty & the beast. Sally Hawkins as Elisa has done well. But I felt the story did not have substance to support it. Not Del Toro's finest.","The Shape of Water",9160,4.2,1.7
"9161",4.5,"  Beautifully shot, acted and directed, The Shape of Water is an ethereal beauty, a marvel of filmmaking. Sally Hawkins shines in leading a talented cast that includes the always-wonderful Richard Jenkins (appropriately nominated for Best Supporting Actor) and Michael Shannon. Interestingly enough, Octavia Spencer, nominated for an Oscar in the Supporting Actress category, might have been the least impressive thing in the film. Nominated for 13-Oscars, this one is going to get some hardware. Another one destined to make the Top 10 list. 4.5/5.","The Shape of Water",9161,4.2,-0.3

"9164",2,"  Ridiculous chick flick version of splash. Spoiler alert its the same movie down to the escaping from scientists and government to live happily ever after under the sea but in a dark unfunny way. Ultimately it failed to make the romantic connection required to risk ones life. A few eggs and some music does not mean love.","The Shape of Water",9164,4.2,2.2
"9165",4.5,"  Del Toro has a distinct ability to pull off magical realism, and the mastery is matched here with fantastic performance of all leading roles, making a niche subject enjoyable to a broad audience.","The Shape of Water",9165,4.2,-0.3
"9166",5,"  Guillermo del Toro is back!!! and not to mention has crafted out another if not the.. most accomplished and outstanding effort of his career, this film may as well deserve to be called his 'Magnum Opus'. In saying that, the film itself is a mix of a surrealistic fantasy underlined by it's cold war America setting and political context, while at the same time it's an unlikely and uncanny romance that works so well, I can't help but think ""it's like nothing I've ever seen before"", unparalleled and unprecedented in any shape or form (unintended pun XD). While the story is almost a lot more character driven than plot from Sally Hawkins' outstanding performance (high hopes to win gold), del Toro never loses focus on any of the film's characters whose conflict's as well as their developments are just as compelling as the overarching plotting of the film. Even as outstanding as the film is to experience from it's story and characters, it's visual palette is every bit as outstanding as del Toro's direction dictates and the flawless editing and flow of the film's construction alone. Not one moment was I bored throughout the entire run-time of this film, I can't recommend it highly enough for what it's worth and that is; 'every minute of your time and every cent of your money you may pay to see this film, it's an instant classic for the ages and not just for Guillermo del Toro alone.","The Shape of Water",9166,4.2,-0.8
"9167",5,"  In an age of Marvel and Fast and the Furious it's just oh so refreshing to come across a piece of film that is actually art as well. The Shape of Water is by no means a perfect film, regardless of it's Oscar nominations. In fact, at it's core it's a very excellent retelling of Beauty & The Beast. In film, and life, it's never about the destination. The journey is the story. This story has a journey. One that will keep you interested and wondering and maybe even spark some inspiration deep inside you that you never knew you had. This is a story of humanity and love and maybe moreover, who exactly gets to define what either of those things are.I haven't seen all of the Best Picture noms, but I have changed my mind from Three Billboards to Shape. Three is more than deserving. The story and performances are stellar and deserved of recognition. Sally Hawkins however, steals the show. He performance as a meek, caring, loving mute is simply masterful. The emotion expressed in her face and through every sign (sign language) can be felt by the audience. She seems to transcend what it means to connect with a character when all you can do is feel what they feel instead of simply agreeing or disagreeing.If Shape ends up taking Best Picture, I will not be disappointed. If any of you out there are on the fence about seeing this film, remember that it is a beautiful love story and not an action movie about a fishman. Don't watch trailers and immerse yourself in the world Del Toro creates. You will not be disappointed.tl;dr - A stellar film with high caliber performances. Don't miss the best film of the year. With competition like this, that's saying a lot.","The Shape of Water",9167,4.2,-0.8
"9168",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is the latest film from Guillermo del Toro and it certainly delivered. It's well shot and well acted, with great acting from Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon. Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg and Octavia Spencer were pretty good in their roles as well. The ending isn't what I wanted, but the story is still quite engaging.","The Shape of Water",9168,4.2,-0.3

"9173",5,"  Visually wonderful and beautiful. Some scenes you would swear that your actually underwater but special effects comes through. I know some scenes like the bathroom scene, that was actually filmed underwater. Being Guillermo Del Toro, you would think that it's more of a sci-fi movie than anything else, but this is a straight up Romance Drama film with a good sense of humor. I was laughing out loud at times in the theater.I really liked the story, even though it felt like the relationship between the two main characters seems familiar. Very interesting premise and I loved Michael Shannon's character in this movie. He played it to a tee. Even though he is the supposed villain in the movie, I couldn't help but really grow attached to his character. He's a wonderful actor.The beginning scene was amazing to watch. I felt like I was back in Rapture, the main city in the game Bioshock. I really wish he'd gone down that more Bioshock aesthetic but the look of it in the movie was really nice either way.Overall, really good movie with some really good ideas, acting, and a great story.","The Shape of Water",9173,4.2,-0.8

"9180",2,"  I went into this movie with very high hopes, but... I really didn't enjoy it, sadly. The cinematography is beautiful and the effects are great, but the story and characters (other than Michael Shannon's) are just kind of dull. The choices made in the film are very odd and what could have been an interesting and possibly touching love story between outcasts is overshadowed by gratutitous nudity and sex scenes that seem out of place, sudden gore in an attempt to shock, and lack of any meaningful development between the two lovers. Although the time period is mildy fitting, it also seemed plagued by the typical ""White / Christian men are all evil, dumb, sexist and racist (or some combo thereof) and minorities, gays, people with disabilities and freaks of nature are all opressed but generally good-hearted and kind. Yeah... so, what else is new in Hollywood?","The Shape of Water",9180,4.2,2.2
"9181",0.5,"  Like, really awful. Really, really bad. I can't believe it has this many good reviews. Weird, cross-species sex is the only redeemable factor ;)","The Shape of Water",9181,4.2,3.7
"9182",4,"  Guillermo del Toro has found himself to be quite the respected filmmaker over the years but, if I had to be brutally honest, I'd have to say that he's really only made a few films that could be classed as 'great' and he's not adverse to being disappointing on occasion. His latest films, Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim received a very mixed reception with the latter, in particular, being a huge misfire for me. That said, I do admire the man's imagination and I keep returning, hoping to see something of the greatness of Cronos, The Devil's Backbone and most importantly his near masterpiece of fantasy, Pan's Labyrinth. His latest, The Shape of Water doesn't quite hit the heights of the latter but that still doesn't stop in from being del Toro's best film for quite some time.Plot: Working in a hidden, high-security government laboratory, mute cleaner Elisa (Sally Hawkins) stumbles across a secret, unknown amphibian creature (Doug Jones) which is overseen by agent Strickland (Michael Shannon). Not before long, she develops an emotional attachment to this classified experiment that the government see as an ""asset"". As their relationship develops, Elisa is forced take matters into her own hands which is seen as threat to national security. The thing that's sets del Toro's fantasies apart from the rest is his ability to mesh then with other genres while also injecting a realistic element to them. The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth benefited greatly from their political undercurrent while also tapping into horror and folklore, respectively. The Shape of Water feels very much in tune with them and on this occasion he taps into the Cold War paranoia of America while also recognising the psyche that plagued the country during the secrecy of the Roswell incident and pays homage to the old Hollywood monster movies of yesteryear.There's a lot of care and attention went into this; from Nigel Churcher's rich art direction and Dan Lausten's beautifully rendered cinematography which compliment del Toro's vision and evocation of 1960's Americana. It's the kind of meticulous attention to detail that Todd Haynes would be proud of. But again, it's del Toro's ability to create his own niche by giving the film a very European flavour where I was reminded, on quite a few occasions, of Jean-Pierre Juenet's Amelie which is achieved through the magical score by Alexandre Desplat. It boasts a marvellous central performance from Sally Hawkins who's entirely convincing as a mute where she's so animated and expressive that it's easy to forget that she doesn't actually speak a word (with the exception of singing a musical number) throughout the entire film. Great support too from the imposing and always reliable Michael Shannon and the hugely underrated Richard Jenkins. Jenkins, in particular, brings a much needed light-heartedness to the film and despite being better known for his dramatic chops it's often overlooked just how good his comedic timing is. Here, it's on wonderfully subtle display. On paper, The Shape of Water probably sounds preposterous but visually and emotionally it's a vibrant experience that manages to be sweet, suspenseful and exciting all in equal measure. Put simply, this really shouldn't work but it's credit to del Toro that it does. He masterfully balances all of these elements and combines a romantic love story and sci-fi creature fable into a very convincing adventure.Mark Walker","The Shape of Water",9182,4.2,0.2

"9187",0.5,"  Not a good movie. Not a good story.I found the movie pointless. The story was boring. Above all the film did not effectively sell or explain their intended message. I'm sure this movie is about finding loveand being loved and how love often cannot be explained or can. E unconventional. However, this film shows a clearly psychologicaly flawed woman that falls ""in love"" with an "" intelligent"" see creature that at best would be described as seriously mentally handicapped if it were human. The film depicts the creature as fairly clueless to any deep thoughts beyond physical urges and child like. The film never shows why she loves it other than the fact he is rejected and flawed like her. Again the heroine is clearly psychologically damaged demonstrated by this and the fact that she can intermittently speak or squeak suggesting a psychological barrier to her mutism than a physical barrier. To summarizeA crazy lady has sex w a mentally disabled fish so she can feel better about herself. I just saved you 2 + hours of misery","The Shape of Water",9187,4.2,3.7
"9188",4,"  A tremendous, beautifully well-acted drama, with magic and mystery. Sally Hawkins is stunning, in particular, but the entire cast is awe-inspiring. The story has some challenges, and could have been stronger, but this is still one of Guillermo del Toro's best works to date.","The Shape of Water",9188,4.2,0.2
"9189",5,"  More like Beauty and the Beast, but much more than just a fairy tale. The movie carries an educational theme about the imperfect. ""Why?"" and ""How?"" are the questions that always on the top of people's tongue when it comes to the way that ""different"" or ""unique"" individuals ""interact"". People often think that these individuals are incapable of finding ""joy"". The Shape of Water reminds us that they absolutely can, that they are just the same as everyone else. ""God, he's not even a human!"" (G.)""If we do nothing, neither are we."" (E.)","The Shape of Water",9189,4.2,-0.8
"9190",4,"  Within the first five minutes of The Shape of Water, Sally Hawkins' mute maid Eliza sets a timer, hops in the bath, and masturbates. The film has been marketed as an adult fairy tale, and the first part of the statement can't be ignored. Don't get me wrong; this isn't a raunch-fest about fish-sex. But unlike Pan's Labyrinth, which was an adult fairy tale from a child's perspective, The Shape of Water is distinctly mature through-and-through, a brutally violent, quietly introspective, and lusciously gorgeous delight. It also happens to feature a sexy fish-man.Even if said sexy fish-man doesn't work for you, there's no denying how stunningly beautiful this film is, with oversaturated blues giving Eliza's apartment the feeling of an aquarium and neon greens (or is that teal?) frequently blanketing the players. In many fantastic ways, the art design evokes Bioshock's Rapture, particularly when combined with its cold-war setting and record-box soundtrack. In a touch that could be viewed as cheap if I had a heart of stone, Eliza lives above a cinema, and The Shape of Water definitely earns the La La Land/The Artist movie-about-how-great-movies-are slot at the Oscars. But it does so in little ways, such as Eliza and her neighbour Giles performing a small couch dance routine, before paying it off in a big, spectacular moment.The bloody violence might turn some off, and indeed ventures into fairly rough territory at times. Michael Shannon brings a lot of intensity to a fairly one-note heel, finding new dimensions of depravity in every act. One could also fault Del Toro for spending too much time with his side characters, but he paints Giles, Dmitri, and Zelda with a fine enough brush that I wouldn't want to see them excised even if the occasionally feel extraneous. But the heart lies within Eliza and The Creature, whose sensitive puppy-dog attitude never feels manipulative. If this kind of fantastical twist is what movie romance needs, I for one welcome our new sexy fish-man overlords.","The Shape of Water",9190,4.2,0.2
"9191",3,"  While visually beautiful and unique. perhaps my own excitement for this film made it fall a bit flat. I expected a nuanced love story, and that relationship was the least developed of all. I wish they had spent more time on the love story, and less on developing the other supporting characters. Elisa's relationship with her neighbor, Giles, played by Richard Jenkins, was far more compelling than the one with her creature.","The Shape of Water",9191,4.2,1.2
"9192",5,"  A truly magical experience, the Shape of Water is likeable and exciting at every turn. All of the characters are believable and fun to watch, and you understand each characters motivation clearly. There is CGI, but it serves only to enhance the experience and makes things more believable rather than fake-looking. Amazing film, one of my favourites I've seen this year.","The Shape of Water",9192,4.2,-0.8
"9193",1.5,"  I went to see this film, expecting to love it. How could any film with Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins be bad? But, I found it hard to sit through the whole movie, filled with scenes of unnecessary gore and brutality (I even had to shut my eyes for a few seconds in one scene, something as a hardened cinephile I haven't done for decades) because I just didn't want to soak in the gore I knew was coming. Scenes of masturbation in a bathtub, torture (of animals? Or a god? And of a mortally wounded man), oozing wounds, and the ecstatic consuming of junk food.... all distracted from the very thin story. And for all the ASL used by the main character, hearing all her friends recite vocally what she was signing was RIDICULOUS, like much of the rest of the movie. Ignore all the Oscar buzz, and go see ""Paddington 2"" for a good time.","The Shape of Water",9193,4.2,2.7

"9198",3.5,"  I love Del Toro's work, with Pan's Labrynth my favourite movie of his, so I had high hopes. However, it was slightly disappointing, even if this could be down to my high expectations. Sally Hawkins is great, despite playing a mute and using no words, and the the design of the ""aquaman"" has clearly been crafted with care. The storyline is one we have seen many times before though, even if there is a lot of charm surrounding it. Three Billboards outside Ebbing is a better film though in my opinion.","The Shape of Water",9198,4.2,0.7

"9200",0.5,"  The movie had a brilliant idea, bringing an unknown intelligent creature from under the depths of lakes and swamps and oceans but aside from that it didn't have anything going for it. It is like a poorly written fanfiction created by a 14 year old girl who over sexualizes things and mistakes it as good writing. I'm not one against nudity and sexuality in films but in this work the story could have advanced just as well, if not better, without it. 0.3/10 is my rating... Very disappointed.","The Shape of Water",9200,4.2,3.7

"9203",1,"  Horrible. It was like taking the 1954 B film classic, ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and trying to make it into a raunchy, vulgar joke of a film. The movie opens with Sally Hawkins nude in a bathtub masturbating. Then Sally and Octavia get to watch the security guard pee in the bathroom. Then the guard who gets two fingers bitten off by the hokey ""creature"" sees his kids off to school then we get to watch him hump his wife in bed. The narrative was classy too, such as ""You know corn flakes were invented to reduce masturbation."" And, ""as long as you have a finger left to put in her vagina."" The thing is, none of this narrative or vulgar scenes had ANYTHING to do with the plot. I'm not a prude and have nothing against a meaningful love scene pertinent to the plot (such as Leonardo and Kate's love scene in the Titanic) but this movie was nothing but inane vulgar trash.","The Shape of Water",9203,4.2,3.2

"9206",1.5,"  I am really at a loss... how did this do better than The Greatest Showman which is, by far, a movie with a superior story? There's nothing relatable about a woman having sex with a fish. I think people are just claiming to like it because they want to seem artsy and cool... I saw the shape of water right after I saw the greatest showman and was actually offended that it was nominated for 7 Golden Globes. I really need someone to help me out here. Maybe I'm just too clueless to understand...","The Shape of Water",9206,4.2,2.7
"9207",5,"  I went to this movie expecting to really dislike it. The story just seemed too bizarre. So glad I went. Yes...the plot is bizarre, there are so many things that I thought were great.

"9208",0.5,"  liberal garbage. The cast is a Democratic party coalition-of-the-fringes against a generic evil white man. Generic evil white man prevents alien ""other"" from screwing a white woman.

That is literally what this movie is about, pure political propaganda.","The Shape of Water",9208,4.2,3.7

"9213",4,"  Beauty and the Beast for adults. The music leads the film to a place of magic and peace. In love.","The Shape of Water",9213,4.2,0.2
"9214",3,"  Fairy tales attract us because of their symbolic simplicity: they exist in world of archetypes, in this case it's Beauty and the Beast. But that simplicity can easily stray into thinness. Del Toro makes great efforts to mask this with wondrously rich production design (a 40's - 50's world of deco wallpapers, green ceramic, linoleum and chrome has rarely looked so solid and the lighting is phantasmagoric) and by surrounding his central romance with a variety of skilled character actors (Jenkins is gently sublime as ever, with Spencer and Stulbarg lending kindly support,) but the story is simple to the point of non-existence. Hawkins acts like a ballerina but her marine lover is too much a thing of rubber fins and expressionless digital eyes to ever register any real emotion, leaving the burden of transmitting the relationship entirely to the heroine. And, adult as the film may be with its gunshot wounds and nods towards sexual assault, homophobia, racism and torture, any child knows that fish don't have penises. Shannon does excellently in the role of the implacable, self-loathing pursuer, so familiar from so many Disney cartoons. In the end, this has no more substance than any animation from the Magical Kingdom. Even on Del Toro's own terms, this doesn't come close to threatening 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'The Devil's Backbone.' It's too weightlessly neat, a child's toy wrapped in grown-up paper.","The Shape of Water",9214,4.2,1.2
"9215",2.5,"  The Shape of Water is visually interesting but the movie falls flat emotionally. I'm glad I saw it but I wouldn't recommend it.

"9221",5,"  An enchanting visual masterpiece. The Shape of Water challenges your notions of human empathy and shirks the norms of a tired Hollywood with its daring and unapologetic dive into an exploration of human fantasy, love and repression. Sally and Richard's onscreen performance is unnervingly convincing to the point that it hurts to think that they are acting their characters and not exposing their secret reality. The only true pain, however, in seeing the movie was coming to realize how predictable the plot is. Major plot points begin to unravel long after it is obvious what must happen for the story to advance. An unfortunate lack of surprise. With that said, this can stand on its own just as a work of art if not even a film but it makes a stellar film even where it needs not to.","The Shape of Water",9221,4.2,-0.8

"9225",4,"  So how should I put this, The Shape of Water is extremely hard to explain not due intercity of its story but the overwhelming emotions that can not be explained, it can only be felt, the story itself is profoundly moving and touching, although I find myself obligated to admit that I wasn't that amazed by it but I believe it had something special from its beautiful cinematography to the simplistic yet convincing acting by Shannon and especially Hawkins who manged to render a moving performance without saying a single word yet it was so gripping, Desplate's music was so magical and enchanting and it gives the film a charming vibe to it, and now for the directing, Del Toro spared us none of his talents and it is obvious to see, although it wasn't as powerful as I wanted it to be but I believe he manged to put on a good effort that is certainly worth parsing despite the fact that it could have been much better, I won't label it as amazing but I certainly think it's good.","The Shape of Water",9225,4.2,0.2

Got in the movie theater thinking I was going to watch just a far-fetched sci-fi love story. but how wrong i wasWhat most struck me was the breaking of every possible paradigm in main stream plots , tearing apart our socially constructed ideas of what the ""good guy"" should do or be like. All characters are rebellious here, all trying to fight back against the system. The outcasts of society all thriving to survive.

"9236",3,"  An idolization of 1960s nostalgia and little else. The movie makes frequent detours to show classic cars, musical films on old TVs, blinking theater lights, hand-painted ads, old house construction, diners, etc. There's a good dose of artistic symbolism forced in too. People in the movie seem out of place and there's almost no story at all. It's fun to watch, but at the same time so frustrating that it could have been much better.","The Shape of Water",9236,4.2,1.2
"9237",3.5,"  Would have been a great love story but as always Hollywood has to put gratuitous sex, nudity and violence in almost every scene. The backdrop is very La La Land and this outstanding plot is ruined at almost every turn. The bad guy is so very very bad that not one scene that he is in occurs without some type of disgusting behavior to just drive that home. Many aspects of this film were just overdone and insulting to the viewers who, despite what Hollywood thinks, are intelligent enough to get it without being beaten over the head with it.","The Shape of Water",9237,4.2,0.7
"9238",0.5,"  Saw it. Wasn't impressed at all. Unneeded nudity and an unbelievable love story. Vastly overrated. Del Toro's depiction of the straight white male antagonist is typical Hollywood. Of course he's racist, of course he cheats on his wife, of course he's a bully. Apparently Hollywood's idea of diversity nowadays is more about bashing one segment of the population in order to appeal to the others. This is the last film I see by this overrated director.

The feel seems spot on for the period of time and the acting is suburb. It is not a prequel to his hellboy which fans think and that is because they made merman look too much like Abe.

The fish dude is just mediocre at best, and the main character is easily the most cliche kind of woman in a ""romantic"" scenario. The plot is really weak and when you think it'll get better it just stops, the bad guys are pictured as pure evil, without any motivation aside from beeing total jerks.

"9261",5,"  After being released in December 2017, this film FINALLY made it around to the desolate corner of the world I inhabit, and I couldn't be more thrilled! While the trailers do glimpse the premise of the film, they also fall far short of revealing the true humanity (both heartfelt and horrifying) on display by the time the credits roll. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins embody the fragility and insecurity and aloneness we all feel (or have at times felt), and their redemption in the arms of an unlikely (soul) remind us that life is about our relationships with (and treatment of) each other.","The Shape of Water",9261,4.2,-0.8
"9262",0.5,"  Totally overrated and predictable story. Visually excellent, but take away the technical elements and there is not a lot left. Gratuitous sex scenes were like finger nails on chalk board.

"9265",4.5,"  There was far too much nudity in this film, to the point of making it cheap when the idea was to make it starkly in contrast with the dark world surrounding it in richness. It also was a little tiresome and cliche that all of the protagonists were blatantly weird compared to the rest of society, or shunned. Doing so made anyone normal appear to be a villain, though that is generally not realistic. Other than this the film was fantastic, mostly because it is a visual marvel, the power of the dialogues given in ASL, and Michael Shannon's portrayal of a man who has everything and yet really has nothing inside really shined throughout the film.","The Shape of Water",9265,4.2,-0.3
"9266",2,"  I really don't get the love for this movie. It's somewhere between ridiculous and disgusting. I will say the actors gave it a great effort despite being so blasted weird.If you are artsy fartsy film viewer then maybe there is something here for you. If you like grounded movies that tell a relatable story, this is just the worst.","The Shape of Water",9266,4.2,2.2
"9267",2,"  Plot should have set this movie to be a straight forward and uplifting film BUT is murdered by the grim, depressing and overly gory tone of the whole movie.

"9268",4,"  Great movie if a little vulgar and risque at times. Great work in the costume and props department, makes me want to make my own amphibious man costume.

If it were less vulgar and risque, it would have gotten 5/5","The Shape of Water",9268,4.2,0.2
"9269",0.5,"  Probably the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. Incredibly uncomfortable watching a fish/man and a woman have sex.. don't bring your loved ones or family members to this movie. In fact, don't even waste your time watching it.","The Shape of Water",9269,4.2,3.7
"9270",2,"  Too dark, dreary, nonsesical dreck. No wonder got Oscar Nominations.Regreted seeing it. Not since Talia (Coppola) Shire enchanted as Stallone's love 'Adriannnn!' has an actress so charmed the audience. The Amphib Reptile mer-man Monster was slightly more improved since the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Tired old villains southern racist misogynist. Mz Hawkins charmed the audience as not done since Mz Coppola as 'Adrienne!' in the first 'Rocky' movie. Yet as a 'mute' she has been nomd for Oscar. Do they still have a 'silent movie' or 'pantomime' category?","The Shape of Water",9270,4.2,2.2
"9271",4,"  The Shape of Water is written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. It stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Rickard Jenkins, and Octavia Spencer. The story focuses on Elisa, played by Hawkins. She's a mute woman who works as a janitor at a government research facility in 1962 Baltimore. While working, she notices scientists bring in a creature that looks like a combination of a fish and human. They experiment on the creature, thinking that it might help the US in the space race. When no one is around, Elisa goes to where the creature is held out of curiosity. She then starts communicating with the creature and forms a romantic bond with it. Eventually, she decides to break the creature out of the facility after she learns it's going to be killed. It's a very unique story, so I won't reveal more.This original story is a little bit like Splash or Beauty and the Beast, but is easily the most unique movie I've seen this year. It is a rather strange story. What you think will happen doesn't happen and what you think will never happen does happen. It makes for a simple but odd story that may turn a few people off. As for me, it felt odd at first, but by the middle, it won me over. Once I decided to just go with the flow, I enjoyed this movie. At its heart, this is a simple, sweet romance story with bits of drama, fantasy, sci-fi, horror, thriller, and even a little social commentary thrown in. The cinematography is great as this movie looks beautiful. The music score from Alexandre Desplat is very lovely to listen to, and the acting performances across the board are good, though not great. The characters are investing as they're an outcast in some way. Eliza for example can't talk and she feels the creature is the only one who can understand her. Even the villain here has a feeling of being incomplete.In the end, this is a strange movie, but ultimately very charming and original, especially in this time of sequels and reboots.","The Shape of Water",9271,4.2,0.2
"9272",0.5,"  While the movie was visually pleasing, I found the storyline to be boring, predictable, and unnecessarily violent. I'm genuinely confused by the hype surrounding this movie.

"9276",4,"  Unique and visually stunning for certain, The Shape of Water doesn't quite know what story to focus on; giving us themes and perspective shifts that don't feel cohesive. Del Toro's antagonist in Shannon is one dimensional and irritating, with no nuance or development, and he relies too heavily on a gimmick during one of the film's pinnacle scenes; but his protagonists carry the film with gripping performances.","The Shape of Water",9276,4.2,0.2
"9277",0.5,"  I get the story, but I don't get all the hype. I couldn't get invested in this movie. It boils down to a strange romance between and woman and a sea creature.

"9283",5,"  The Shape of Water is a wondrous, sublimely beautiful film that is bursting with heart and overflowing with ideas. It is a unique creation, a testament to the vision of its director Guillermo del Toro. Set in 1962 Baltimore it's a multi layered film that operates on many levels. It is fantasy, romance and even a spy espionage thriller. Without giving too much away a sea creature from South America has been captured and brought to the US. A cleaner at the facility forms a strong bond with the creature. What develops is a film that will sweep you away with its heart and beauty. Emotion overflows and combined with the incredible design it blew me away. Performances are all outstanding but special mention should go to Hawkins, Shannon and Jenkins in their roles. They are truly superb. The score only adds to a film that is an ode to inclusion ,acceptance and love. It is infused with melancholy and hope, making for a very special two hours of cinema.","The Shape of Water",9283,4.2,-0.8

The message of love and the problems of prejudice and fear are managed with dexterity. A great movie that can be watched again and again for various reason. Great Art","The Shape of Water",9286,4.2,-0.8
"9287",5,"  Imaginative, absorbing, visual and oddly romantic, this film was a surprise and a good surprise at that. Who would have thought you could feel for two mute main characters, one a cleaner, the other a fish? Hats off to the film makers for pulling this off with humour and excitement thrown in for good measure","The Shape of Water",9287,4.2,-0.8
"9288",3,"  I wasnt really drawn in. The character development could have gone further. I think the plot and the sexual nature of the characters made me a little put off by the whole story. Its well shot with a good cast and certainly entertains but I dont think it was really that great.","The Shape of Water",9288,4.2,1.2
"9289",4.5,"  A nearly perfect film. I can only imagine the low audience score is due to del Toro fans who watched it thinking they were going to see one of his horror/sci fi genre films and were disappointed in seeing a genuinely lyrical fairytale. A wonderful film about love and daring, and learning about one's own nature as a human being or otherwise. This is a film warning about the danger of hating the living truth while preferring ideology instead. What would you do to protect the innocent from torture? It's fascinating to see the low rating from people who had some kind of aversion to the romance with a water creature, because they totally missed the ""reveal"" at the end of the film. It was clear to me from the middle of the film that those scars on her neck were significant, but it seems the detractors just never got it. .","The Shape of Water",9289,4.2,-0.3

"9291",5,"  the cinematography was amazing. Brsutifully done for sure. Makes you think. One ofthose movies thst uwalk out from and are in awe. Not quite sure how u feel. And then it starts to settle. And u realize how the movie was bigger than u, larger than our banal everyday lives. It really is about how there is touch of monster inside all of us, and what really defines a human. What makes us human? A story abt bout love, compassion, hope, friendship, loneliness, what we seek and desire, the moral choices we all face making and much more. Overall the movie is eerie, whimsical and unusual. Certainly a big contender for the oscars!","The Shape of Water",9291,4.2,-0.8

"9299",3,"  Movie's preview says it all--odd fantasy genre. If that's what you're in mood for, then you'll probably like it to some degree. Movie was alright (especially if you pay matinee price or rent it) but nowhere deserving of the ridiculous amount of Oscar nominations (I believe 13). After the movie finished and the lights went up, I looked at everyone's faces, the vast majority of which were confused or bewildered. In addition, two women in my row kept trying to explain what they thought of it but merely kept saying ""I just don't know what to say."" That says it all.","The Shape of Water",9299,4.2,1.2
"9300",0.5,"  I really want to like it, but I found it a bit presumptuous. I felt like I was suppose to have feelings for fishman and mutegirl but it doesn't really develop. Cinematography is pretty good and a few of the other characters were a little more engaging but the over all movie was little more than a sideshow.","The Shape of Water",9300,4.2,3.7
"9301",0.5,"  I have long ago learned that rotten tomato reviews are extremely unreliable. This movie had two huge problems. Number 1, the storytelling was atrocious and almost nonexistent. Number 2, the filmmakers treat the audience like idiots. If you'd like to see a movie that has very little in the way of story and what little it does have is thrown in your face, because the movie doesn't think you'll be smart enough to pick up on even painfully obvious clues, than this is the movie for you.","The Shape of Water",9301,4.2,3.7

"9304",1,"  This is a really awful movie. The characters are cardboard cut outs, no motivation or interest. The story is so full of gigantic holes, so riddled with simplistic, obvious foreshadowing, that the ending is robbed of all surprise and the audience is insulted by the stupidity they must adopt to follow the plot. Just terrible.","The Shape of Water",9304,4.2,3.2
"9305",3.5,"  Overhyped is the operative word here. A pretty and elegant movie that once again is carried by Sally Hawkins, but I wouldn't call it the achievement of the year.","The Shape of Water",9305,4.2,0.7

"9309",2.5,"  Meh! with all the hype I was expecting more. The story is a romantic sci-fi that is ridiculous at best. Lots of unexplained things even Octavia Spencer's performance was lack luster, and I usually like her. The premise is weak because in a high security facility the only time security is important is in one scene. Why was the equipment made to look old when it's all brand new in that era? Maybe it's a just a beauty and the beast that's all wet?","The Shape of Water",9309,4.2,1.7

"9315",4.5,"  wonderful. captivating. guillermo del toro has shown us his brilliance for storytelling with THE SHAPE OF WATER. who knew the relationship between a 'monster' and a mute could communicate so much. this is the perfect movie for date night. and the rich 1950s setting adds another delicious layer to the experience. i watch many flicks such as star wars & thor. it takes THE SHAPE OF WATER to remind me cinema can reach so much further.be sure to enjoy this at the theatre to take in the cinematography. and torontonians will get enjoyment out of our favourite city woven into this instant classic.","The Shape of Water",9315,4.2,-0.3

"9317",5,"  Beautiful poignant and simpleThis movie is tonally and visually perfect. however the story is just a bit too simplistic at places, with the characters all falling clearly on one or the other side of the beautiful grey area that makes you think.

"9318",2,"  flat out boring movie, the creature looked like Hellboy fish friend, the main character seemed to be obsessed with having sex with this thing, and the story was kind of half ass, it's crazy this guy also made such a great movie pans labyrinth then this? and it's crazy it was up for Oscars, I can't stand the way Oscars look at movies, everything has to have a deep message , and sometimes the message is pretty common sense.","The Shape of Water",9318,4.2,2.2

"9322",0.5,"  It's hard to rate this. Except for 5 scenes that are unbelievably morally objectionable, which could easily have been left out, it would be an absolutely perfect film. It will drift into cult film obscurity, for those who like their fantasy as a chaser for porn.","The Shape of Water",9322,4.2,3.7
"9323",5,"  del Toro is a Master Raconteur - Critics can cram it if they diss this incredible story. I want to see an extended version. The audience that watched with me was totally riveted - you could have heard a pin drop. I will pay to see it again on the big screen before I own this masterpiece. Completely recommend this film.","The Shape of Water",9323,4.2,-0.8

"9325",5,"  It's the best auteur driven ""mainstream"" film out there, that may not outlive Del Toro's previous masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth but may actually be a better film, having been sculpted from pure soul and an outsize imagination.","The Shape of Water",9325,4.2,-0.8
"9326",3,"  hmm; i really like Michael Shannon -- he's such a good bad-guy. this movie was weird though! i think i thought it was supposed to be kinda scary/suspensful, but it is not. it is not at all. it's a fricken love story. & a super weird one at that. i'm not sure i'm on board. the imagery was lovely & the story was fine, but i don't think i liked it. i didn't hate it. but i didn't like it.","The Shape of Water",9326,4.2,1.2

"9328",3,"  Over rated. Hope it doesn't win best picture. Definitely not the best of the year.","The Shape of Water",9328,4.2,1.2
"9329",4.5,"  I thought I wasn't really going to like this film, but because it got 13 Oscar nominations how could I skip it? (Even if I was worried about a sex scene with the amphibian.) Well, I am so GLAD I went. This was a multi-layered story with excellent performances . Michael Shannon was amazing as the bad guy, as he usually is; Richard Jenkins as the gay friend (an unexpected treat--earning him an oscar nom!); Octavia Spencer playing a character you've seen her play a few times, but she won the Oscar for it so you know she nails it this time too (and got an another oscar nom). And then, Sally Hawkins, as a mute, who carries the film without saying a word, deserving of her oscar nom. The cast is brilliant. Naturally, you have to suspend your disbelief from beginning to end for a movie like this, although they try to make it as true to life as possible. Some scenes really test your ability though. That's OK---this was a great film---it checks all the boxes why we go to the movies (which is what I also said about Slumdog Millionaire.)","The Shape of Water",9329,4.2,-0.3
"9330",4.5,"  This Guillermo del Toro film that has received so many nominations and awards is certainly a sight to behold. At a top secret research facility in the 1960s, a lonely mute janitor portrayed by the talented Sally Hawkins, forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity. It is a re-imagining of The Beauty and the Beast tale inspired by the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Richard Jenkins also delivers a great performance, Michael Shannon acts like a very evil villain and Octavia Spencer is definitely the comic relief. The music was perfect and it is interesting to see that greenish tone in the entire movie.","The Shape of Water",9330,4.2,-0.3
"9331",0.5,"  Absolutely terrible. Wish I could give 0 stars. Save your money","The Shape of Water",9331,4.2,3.7
"9332",0.5,"  Stop with the SJW bullshit","The Shape of Water",9332,4.2,3.7
"9333",4,"  Peculiar, arresting and well-made ... and yet I don't want to see it again. If you're wary of Del Toro's endings and subject matter after Pan's Labrinyth, this isn't as bad (but it's not exactly an clear uplifting one either). It's set in the sixties, so if you don't enjoy the inevitable misogyny, racism and toxic masculinity of that era (embodied in the main antagonist) then perhaps give it a miss. It can be difficult to watch at times, but if you're a fan of movies that are confronting and yet arty, this might be just your thing.","The Shape of Water",9333,4.2,0.2
"9334",4.5,"  Despite the accusations of plagiarism and plot holes, the movie is done beautifully and the original score is one of the best of the year.","The Shape of Water",9334,4.2,-0.3
"9335",0.5,"  A boring and poorly paced movie. Did not enjoy one bit, the visuals were good, but the story unappealing, characters are unrealistic, and it too quickly shifts into some degenerate porno. Would not reccomend","The Shape of Water",9335,4.2,3.7
"9336",3,"  Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Phantom of the Opera, King Kong, Splash, and ET all rolled into one. Pretty visuals, very good acting from Sally Hawkins and especially Richard Jenkins. Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri was far better in screenplay, overall acting, freshness, and engagement, without the predictability. Frances McDormand was outstanding in her role, unmatched by anyone else this year.","The Shape of Water",9336,4.2,1.2
"9337",5,"  An emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance.","The Shape of Water",9337,4.2,-0.8
"9338",4,"  Gorgeous filmmaking. Loved the originality in all. Imperfections are subtle. Too on the nose with thematical threads in B and C stories. Might have done better to explore fewer subplots and backstories. Overall impressive and I would watch again because it's just glorious visually. Cannot conceive of anyone else but Sally Hawkins in that role!","The Shape of Water",9338,4.2,0.2
"9339",2.5,"  This movie is very well directed, acted, has amazing production values, score, cinematography, etc. but I just could not connect with the story.I was very underwhelmed overall and think it's quite overrated honestly.","The Shape of Water",9339,4.2,1.7

"9342",0.5,"  Completely ruined a great story by telling it as a shallow love story","The Shape of Water",9342,4.2,3.7
"9343",5,"  Del Toro is one of my favorite modernn directors and this is a good example as to why.The story and concept is equally deep and,as some negative review point out, a little silly. However i find the odd elements of this to be a good reason why this and most of del toro's films stand out.He likes to tell stories about oddities in the real world. He wants to show off the wall ideas. (See pan's laberynth) and he does it in a way that captivates viewersDel Toro doesnt give a shit what people think. It just so happens he is a genius.","The Shape of Water",9343,4.2,-0.8
"9344",5,"  As the movie ended I was in a haze. A dream like haze which I didn't want to come out of because the euphoria was so intense it felt real.","The Shape of Water",9344,4.2,-0.8
"9345",5,"  WOW!!! I have no words. Simply the best movie I've ever seen this year. The storyline, the cast and the set are totally amazing.","The Shape of Water",9345,4.2,-0.8
"9346",3.5,"  Sure its a bit social justicey with the protagonists being a mute woman, a black woman and a gay intellectual against a traditional white power structure. Oh and a Soviet agent too on the ""good team"". Fortunately for The Shape of Water I am ignoring this propaganda as Michael Shannon was simply too terrific as the villain and Sally Hawkins did a fantastic job with her character even with a restriction of not being able to speak. It is too bad though that this film did have the propaganda though and that the story as a whole didn't hit me fully regardless. A decent film to me though I can understand why its getting the Academy Award nominations, it has a very progressive story after all.","The Shape of Water",9346,4.2,0.7
"9347",4.5,"  Beautifully crafted film that may be the best work yet by Del Toro. The acting is superb across the board, with Sally Hawkins instantly enchanting Elisa, while Michael Shannon brings layered menace as Strickland. Of course, Doug Jones gives another brilliant performance as the creature, continuing to show he is the Lon Chaney of this generation. Behind the camera, writer/director Guillmero Del Toro crafts a beautiful & intelligent movie, that is a tribute to the 1950's films (like the ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", which this film heavily references) but with modern sensibilities (the racist & sexists attitudes of the day are front & center). The film is visually stunning (the creature effects are nothing short of brilliant) while being a very adult fairy tale (the opening scene in Elise's apartment fully sets that up). Plus, the love story that forms is organic yet magical at the same time. Simply put, one of the finest films of 2017 and just might be Del Toro's masterpiece.","The Shape of Water",9347,4.2,-0.3

"9349",4.5,"  if i told you about her, what would i say..The Shape Of WaterDragging a man by holding his mouth with only two fingers and crushing or pulling out one's wrecked fingers and a cat being eaten by are not only the scenes that will give you goosebumps but it also lets you cringe yourself on the seat whilst on the other side of it it also contains some genuinely beautiful and innocent scenes like common taste of music and sense of similar symptoms and one of the best is water dripping in the theater. The Shape Of Water isn't just a good movie that came across this year; ""year"" isn't the territory it fits in, it is one of the decades or centuries finest of all. Guillermo del Toro sings all of his love to the phantasmagorical genre films on the highest note possible raising the bar for everyone which won't be easy to surpass. Sally Hawkins; as I have mentioned earlier too, is just soothing on the screen, her calmness, rage, love, fear or even funny emotions just rain drops all over the movie. Michael Shannon is dreadful in it and with all his furious in his eyes and persona he completely overpowers the opposite actors on screen and along with the help of some of the best actors doing their best work (Octavia Spencer, Doug Jones and Richard Jenkins) the film manages to enter the major league easily. The Shape Of Water is filled with hope (that's irony, considering its premise), practicality, amusement and hiding along with all of this, horror.","The Shape of Water",9349,4.2,-0.3
"9350",5,"  Amazing movie! The normals are dysfunctional and the outcasts are pure love. Like no movie Ive ever seen.Must see!","The Shape of Water",9350,4.2,-0.8
"9351",4,"  This movie may be better on second viewing, but as it played out exactly as I expected, an underwhelming feeling lingers. On too many accounts del Toro restrains himself which leaves the film feeling restless as it falls short in succeeding the same emotional hits that his previous films have. But even a weaker del Toro film is still a thousand times better than most blockbusters.","The Shape of Water",9351,4.2,0.2
"9352",5,"  Just saw ""The Shape of Water."" Spectacular, magical, tender tale of love, compassion, and kindness. And a movie with a clear animal rights/anti-vivisection theme.

And bring tissues.","The Shape of Water",9352,4.2,-0.8

"9365",4.5,"  FINALLY, I've been waiting to review this movie forever!THE SHAPE OF WATER.It's General Zod vs Abe Sapian, you can't make this stuff up...unless you're Guillermo del Toro & Vanessa Taylor of course.At just over 2 hours, I felt the story was progressing at both a brusque & leisurely pace; the movie was a slow burn, but nothing dragged.The cast was the best I've seen in a long time. Michael Shannon as the villain was great, like the one from The Iron Giant, but way more intimidating, like you just had this instinctual need to not be around him, & his slide from sinister G-Man to total psycho felt very natural, it did take more than one bad day to push him over the edge, but it was far less than you'd expect from a government agent; it really was a top tier performance. Sally Hawkins as the heroine was truly the highlight of the film, she was able to run the gambit of emotions & sell her character only with her expressions & movements, she could've easily been a silent film era star. The Gill-Man was amazing! Doug Jones' body language made del Toro's makeup effects come to life in a way that almost made the original Abe Sapian look cartoonish, he made me believe the creature was real. The rest of the cast was great, Octavia Spencer & Richard Jenkins gave a real face & voice to just how bad things were if you weren't a straight white person in the early '60s while giving their characters just the right quirks, foibles, & quiet dignity to endear them to the audience from the start.The film takes place in the early '60s, but it felt more like '40s or '50s film noir. The whole thing looked like Leave it to Beaver, but without the cheep TV gloss, you could see the grime & the beautiful ugliness, it all felt very real.The effects were the best I've seen in a film in a long time. Del Toro has truly married old school practical effects with CGI, together, as they always were meant to be. Thanks to this blending, nothing looked fake; if other films put in this level of effort, modern cinema would be in a new golden age.The music was a gathering of late '50s songs that really put me in the moment, plus one that helped us peer into our heroine's psyche; they really complemented the story.This film was pure art. It took from so many sources: Shakespeare, the Universal Monsters, sci-fi, classic tales of Mer-folk, the post WWII Communism paranoia, & so much more, & rolled them all up, into something that feels both familiar, & original. The Shape of Water easily gets 4 & 1/2 stars out've 5. It's destined to become a modern classic. And it's a shining example that the best stories, are the oldest; in this case: (fish) boy meets girl.","The Shape of Water",9365,4.2,-0.3
"9366",0.5,"  This movie had a good but slow story line. If it weren't for the UNNECESSARY sex scenes... (Uncaring sex, Masturbation, and complete nakedness) it would have been sweet & romantic. Take those scenes out and you've got a great movie... But the scenes almost made it akward to watch, and really had no point to the story line at all. I thinking he world relies on sexual content too much these days... And it ruins great movies. Just saying.","The Shape of Water",9366,4.2,3.7
"9367",1,"  This movie has to be del Toro winning a bet that who could work creature from the black lagoon into a soft porn, with a dance sequence and a shout out to racial bigotry, homophobia and The Me Too movement, with spys...be ready to laugh.","The Shape of Water",9367,4.2,3.2
"9368",4.5,"  Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite story tellers and directors. His newest movie The Shape of Water is perhaps his best movie yet. It's moving and thought provoking while at the same time loopy and strange. Just what I would expect from him. Sally Hawkins is wonderful in the film. And Octavia Spencer once again proves she is Oscar worthy. The movie is a fairy tale that only the mind of Guillermo del Toro could have created.","The Shape of Water",9368,4.2,-0.3
"9369",0.5,"  Saw this gem today. A disabled hispanic woman joins a black woman, a gay man and a communist to foil the racist, homophobic, brutal white male power structure and Military Industrial complex in the sixties, in order to save an overgrown piece of sushi.Hollywood Loves it. Excellent cast. Nicely shot. The usual stereotypes and themes.Yawn. jp","The Shape of Water",9369,4.2,3.7
"9370",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro is the best! Like Ramses!","The Shape of Water",9370,4.2,-0.8
"9371",4,"  Lovely story of lonely people or creatures finding each other in a harsh world set against the Cold War era.","The Shape of Water",9371,4.2,0.2
"9372",0.5,"  Excruciatingly boring. Really. What do people see in this???","The Shape of Water",9372,4.2,3.7
"9373",3,"  Wanted to like this more - for it to be truly special and it just isn?t - there are a couple of scenes - but the story is so slight - and the pay off so light....","The Shape of Water",9373,4.2,1.2
"9374",4,"  Vivid characterization; believable, atmospheric creature and setting special effects (del Toro's specialty); quirky, well-written script; and nonformulaic elements make this one worth watching.","The Shape of Water",9374,4.2,0.2
"9375",4,"  Handsome and distinctive like all of Del Toro's movies, this one is also very emotionally engaging and reminded me of what I loved so much about Pan's Labyrinth. Set in the past, it really immerses you in an America gone by while also being a potent allegory for the country in 2017, showing that things really aren't all that different after all.A story about otherness, constantly warring philosophies and an enduring love of cinema, this film swept me off my feet. The performances across the board are fantastic, but Sally Hawkins is who stole my heart. One of the most romantic stories I've seen in a long time.","The Shape of Water",9375,4.2,0.2
"9376",0.5,"  This was a terrible movie. While the visual effects were good, the story line was disturbing. A hard boiled egg obsessed masturbating mute who is frequently nude (in her home), whether it is her morning bath (masturbation time) or when she's having intimate relations with the mer-man....So much unnecessary nudity, it did NOT make the movie better in any way. I decided to watch the movie in its entirety because there were parts of it that made it seem that the story line would get better, but then...NOPE...over and over. The synopsis description and all the award nominations make this movie appear to be sensational, but in reality it is not. I was truly disappointed and left the theater laughing at how ridiculous this movie was and what a waste of time and hard earned money.","The Shape of Water",9376,4.2,3.7
"9377",4.5,"  Great story of love. Amazing directing. Amazing acting. Didn't know what to expect but I understand now why the movie is nominated for 13 Oscars. Highly recommend it????????","The Shape of Water",9377,4.2,-0.3
"9378",4,"  A nice and enjoyable fairytale-film, where a woman and an amphibian creature fall in love. Apart from this, we would never lose the unexpected, over the top, violence made by Guillermo Del Toro, where the amount of blood seen in this movie it's a paradox in contrast with the rest of this cheesy plot, and it's not a criticism.","The Shape of Water",9378,4.2,0.2

"9381",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is an engaging sublime tale about love, marginalization and monsters with mesmerizing performances from Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins. Despite a few tonal inconsistencies and forced moments, Guillermo del Toro presents a wonderful modern adult fairy tale for the times.","The Shape of Water",9381,4.2,-0.3
"9382",4.5,"  Just like its amphibious monster, The Shape of Water is an intricate, beautiful (and delightfully strange) thing.","The Shape of Water",9382,4.2,-0.3

"9386",4,"  Loved it as much as the old Tomb Raider!","Tomb Raider",9386,2.7,-1.3
"9387",3,"  Very predictable, more violent and dark than needs be in many scenes. Not the most believable plot. Despite all these flaws, love Alicia Vikander. Good beginning and decent enough cast, even though the overall experience was quite average. Wouldn?t necessarily recommend and yet, I?d probably watch the sequel if they made one.","Tomb Raider",9387,2.7,-0.3
"9388",2,"  I didnt have any high expectations but still this movie managed to be dissapointing.","Tomb Raider",9388,2.7,0.7

"9391",2,"  Cannot stand this actor. Actually, if she could stop her hoarse screeching and grunting and screaming, it might have been okay. Whoever told her that was the great way to show suffering should be fired. That's my main thing, it was so grating - just over and over scream and screech and squeak. When I've been in terrifying situations, I'm not screeching and screaming and squeaking, and neither does any other real female that I know. I hope to never watch her in another movie unless she knocks that crap off.","Tomb Raider",9391,2.7,0.7
"9392",4,"  The acting and the story was superior to the action. The action, for me, was just to over the top. I liked the story and the characters.","Tomb Raider",9392,2.7,-1.3

"9394",2,"  Had high expectations but as I thought this movie can't beat Angelina Jolie's. Quite predictable, kind of boring but it was average.","Tomb Raider",9394,2.7,0.7
"9395",3.5,"  Alicia Vikander is a fresh start for the video game heroine we grew to love since the 90's. But the ones in the early 2000's with Angelina Jolie ,were awful. With the 2013 reboot and the most recent Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft was given a more instinctive nature that shows the skills she possesses, rather than the goods ;). While this film did have it's flaws, I enjoyed watching her character grow.","Tomb Raider",9395,2.7,-0.8
"9396",4.5,"  with regard to games, i prefer final fantasy and dragon warrior over tomb raider. as far as movies go, turns out tomb raider is my crack. only bit that rang false was lu ren sounding vaguely north american., instead of chinese, or at least british. took off half a star for that. sorry for the caps lock, something's wonky with my notebook...","Tomb Raider",9396,2.7,-1.8
"9397",5,"  Loved Alicia Vikander in this film, very good visual effects as well.","Tomb Raider",9397,2.7,-2.3
"9398",3.5,"  Something for every TOMB RAIDER fan to watch. It's fun, action-packed and dramatic. This Portrayal of Lara Croft was like seeing her first adventure, judging by how the character reacts to intense sequences in the movie, it's Lara's First Adventure. And I hope to see more of these movies in the near future. I loved the game, and I'll say the same for the movie.","Tomb Raider",9398,2.7,-0.8
"9399",4,"  I really enjoyed it, and I can't wait for a sequel.","Tomb Raider",9399,2.7,-1.3
"9400",4,"  I personally loved the move a lot. For those that have played the game, i think that they would agree when i say that the movie stayed true to the character we all know and love.The way the movie explored the character of Lara was very good. I think that this film did a great job of capturing the essence of Lara Croft unlike the other Tomb raider movies by Angelina.","Tomb Raider",9400,2.7,-1.3
"9401",4,"  definitely a good entertaining movie! I personally liked this more than the original one. I grew up on tomb raider, and was expecting a shot for shot of the 2013 reboot game, but this was a really great adaptation with some different twists. a few acting mishaps here and there with supporting characters, but alicia KILLED her role and this was a really great movie!! definitely go see it, tomb raider fan or not!","Tomb Raider",9401,2.7,-1.3
"9402",1,"  Bad acting to bad stunts movie sucks","Tomb Raider",9402,2.7,1.7

"9406",4,"  Really good reboot of the tomb raider movie series. I enjoyed the pace and action in the movie and the performances were spot on. Not much humour but that was good as it could have just been a camp runaround. The actress who played Lara Croft did really well. I was impressed.","Tomb Raider",9406,2.7,-1.3
"9407",4,"  Very entertaining and edge of your seat! I want more!","Tomb Raider",9407,2.7,-1.3
"9408",2.5,"  Acting: Alicia Vikander gave a very good performance as Lara Croft and was the highlight of this film. However, she was let down by the acting around her. Storyline: I felt the storyline really became stuck in places and there was a lot of lazy writing. Another aspect of the film that really let down the brilliant approach of Alicia VikanderPacing: Due to the failures of the storyline the pacing of the film was all over the place. At moments it felt like not much was happening and then things were happening too quickly. Genre: For an action film I didn't really feel like there was a lot of action and what there was could have been done better. Enjoyment: The film was ok. I really enjoyed the last 15-20 minutes of the film and found myself wondering why the rest of the film couldn't have been as good. There were moments throughout where Alicia Vikander gave really compelling performances but I found myself daydreaming in places where the storyline faltered.","Tomb Raider",9408,2.7,0.2
"9409",5,"  Great film, similar to the games in many ways, though the story is different.","Tomb Raider",9409,2.7,-2.3
"9410",2.5,"  The movie is not perfect. There are many things one can complain about. But overall, it's entertaining and much better than Wonder Woman.","Tomb Raider",9410,2.7,0.2
"9411",3.5,"  Take as a purely action flick, movie is pretty good. I liked a lot of the visual effects, and to me Matthias was an excellent antagonist.","Tomb Raider",9411,2.7,-0.8
"9412",5,"  The best Tomb Raider/Video game adaptation ever!","Tomb Raider",9412,2.7,-2.3
"9413",4,"  A grounded and more realistic version of the iconic female protagonist. Paying proper homage to the reboot game which you will like even if you didn't play the game but will absolutely love it if you did.","Tomb Raider",9413,2.7,-1.3
"9414",4,"  Considering the bad reputation of video game movies, I was surprised by Tomb Raider. I have actually played some of the games so I did feel like certain things fitted in the games. This movie is an origin story for the character but it's based more off of the 2013 game. I have only played the games from the second era. You know, the ones where Lara was trying to find out what happened to her mother? The action sequences actually do feel like something out of a Tomb Raider game. The platforming elements, the bow-and-arrow and some tense moments actually feel like a quick time event. Naturally, since that's what the third era of games are built upon, the movie has Uncharted elements. Alicia Vikander is actually a pretty good choice for Lara Croft, especially this one based off of the M-rated games. I have never seen the Angelina Jolie movies but she does look perfect for the choice of Croft as well since they both base themselves off of their attractiveness and resourcefulness at the same time. Perhaps the braid and dual pistols at the end of the movie are a bit too much for the sake of fanservice. The sequel hook at the end for me was ""...eeeeehhhh"". I didn't think I would enjoy Tomb Raider as much as I did but here I am. Maybe I should see more Alicia Vikander movies. The movie rises on the strength of her performance.","Tomb Raider",9414,2.7,-1.3
"9415",2.5,"  sometimes the average is right","Tomb Raider",9415,2.7,0.2
"9416",3.5,"  The heart of Tomb Raider is there they did their homework sadly the execution is lacking on some aspects and they took several liberties with the characters and the story overall but is really hard to adapt such a lengthy story and cram it all together in only one movie, they put the effort.","Tomb Raider",9416,2.7,-0.8
"9417",4,"  awesome, fact paced , ????????????","Tomb Raider",9417,2.7,-1.3
"9418",4,"  This felt more like the Lara I used to manoeuvre in the video games, trying to survive and succeed both in the old and new genres. I love this film reboot and watching Alicia wikander establish herself as lara. Alicia brings lara to life very much in the way I had hoped to see in the earlier films. There are some great moments in this film and I look forward to a sequel, with a stronger story line I hope.","Tomb Raider",9418,2.7,-1.3
"9419",3.5,"  Video game movie adaptations, boy have they been bad. Here is one that is not bad, not stupid, and very watchable. Cool!There's not a lot to say about Tomb Raider. It's an action movie, and it succeeds at that in nearly every way. The action scenes are interesting and fun to watch. Alicia Vikander, who did nearly all her own stunts, is also great. She helms the role in a way that will please fans of the game. While in the original movies, Lara Croft was very sexualized, but in this reboot, she is a strong female hero, which is amazing and refreshing to see in a blockbuster. The stunt work and action scenes are fantastic. I have only a few problems with this movie. The beginning relies on narration, which is really unnecessary and weird. Everything that is explained in the beginning is directly explained later, so why is it there? The story is pretty generic, too.Tomb Raider tries to adapt the 2013 reboot game and is mostly successful. It's an enjoyable action movie that I would recommend, and is definitely the best video game adaptation, but there isn't too much competition. It's a video game movie that is action-packed and enjoyable, and has a female action hero, which is awesome! While it's not without it's flaws, I think it's worth seeing.","Tomb Raider",9419,2.7,-0.8
"9420",2.5,"  Angelina's First is irreplaceable","Tomb Raider",9420,2.7,0.2

"9422",4.5,"  The original movies were like the original games; an oversexualised Lara, over the top moments and not a lot of character. This was more like the new games; a more grounded setting, better story and characters, and more sense. It also stands out compared to other video game movies like Mario Bros as an enjoyable movie for fans and newbies to the series.","Tomb Raider",9422,2.7,-1.8
"9423",2.5,"  MINOR SPOILERS.I was forced to go see this because my girlfriend is in it. She was great, as always, but was held down by the constraints of a relatively uninteresting story and a mediocre script. This could have been compelling and a fine start to a franchise. It wasn't. The script never popped. It never rose above the pedestrian. It never became memorable.The first 20 minutes of the film was totally wasted and could have been handled better with a mere three minutes of skillful writing. Several of the scenes were complete throwaways. Thus, the very weak first act failed to establish interest and convincingly build both the character origin and necessary relationships. Instead, we got a silly bike race. I can only recall a single outfit for Alicia, whose grace and beauty should have been far better utilized in the setup at the very least.The initial second act Hong Kong scene also a total waste that should have been cut from the script before production. Walter Goggins did a good job, but the villain he portrayed was a cardboard cutout without depth, sufficient motivation, or any redeeming qualities. A one-dimensional and unconvincing baddy who also couldn't overcome a boring script. His character created an unnecessary plot hole left unexplained and gaping like an open wound. Rote and verbatim oral and visual repetition of the subject of the whole quest seemed to indicate they knew the whole point of the story was weak and uninteresting. Rather than fix it, they just repeated it to make sure we didn't miss the little bit they had done. The twist wasn't one, and was obvious from the beginning, lifted wholesale from ROTLA III. The stakes never felt real or significant, although they should have. The final cliffhanger a seeming paradox that could have been easily resolved by the father, yet was inexplicably left to become the story's not-so-secret moving evil force. Had the father simply removed the impediment in his control, there wouldn't have been any story at all. Hard to believe that none of these things were addressed before the flat, mediocre script went into production.Hadn't seen Daniel Wu before. He was excellent, but just as they began to use him effectively, they cut his involvement and forgot what was working. Disintegrates into a CGI fest that mimics and palely echoes ROTLA. Still worth seeing if only for Alicia, but a very mediocre film. **.5 /*****. 49/62.","Tomb Raider",9423,2.7,0.2

"9429",5,"  Good action movie. Alicia Vikander is great as young Lara.Well worth seeing. Far better than any of the Angelina jolie era tombraider movies, and stays faithful to the new generation of Tombraider games. One of the best movies based on a video game in my opinion.","Tomb Raider",9429,2.7,-2.3
"9430",4.5,"  I almost did not go see this in the theaters due to all the mediocre and bad reviews, but they are all undeserved. This new reboot of Tomb Raider brought some gripping and intense scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. Alicia Vikander more than live up to the part and delivered a very sexy and fierce young Lara Croft while remaining vulnerable when a scene called for it. The action is good, the special effects are great, and the acting is convincing and not over the top like many movies of this genre. It was impressive. This is by far the best movie based on a video game I have ever seen.","Tomb Raider",9430,2.7,-1.8
"9431",5,"  At last, a fully fleshed out Lara Croft for 2018! Those who know me know I'm a Tomb Raider fan. I played all the games, love the movies, collected the comic books and action figures, and did plenty of cosplay back in the day for contests and cons.This year's Tomb Raider - 2018 pulls the entire IP together with a totally believable Lara Croft. Brilliantly acted, this rendition took the time to flesh out Lara with an updated backstory and character arc that is touching and heartfelt.Gone are the campy villains of previous cinematic portrayals. Lara faces a truly desperate psychopath in her quest to discover the fate of her father. She gathers friends and allies that support the story admirably. Gone is the pandering body padding. Instead, we are treated to an athletic protagonist capable of meeting the physical challenges that confront her.Reckless, vulnerable, ambitious, independent, charismatic, and a little naive, Alicia Vikander as young Lara brings her origin story to life. Without pulling punches (literally), this movie magically incorporates both classic and contemporary game memes with a Lara who redefines today's vibrant female hero.And it's got action, puzzles, and pathos with a mere touch of humor. I just finished watching it the 3rd time, and it holds up to close scrutiny. Tomb Raider - 2018, I love what you've done with Lara. Can't wait for the sequel.","Tomb Raider",9431,2.7,-2.3

"9434",0.5,"  We did not intend to see this movie but we did only because of free tickets that was given to us.There are many kindergarten school plays that's better than this movie and if anyone seen the movie, they would think my comment is an insult to kindergarten school plays. I apologize to all the kindergarten teachers for the comment.This is my first Tomb Raider and I don't understand how the studio approve of this script. If you are the writers (I can't believe if there is more than one but just in case), congratulations, you have pulled off the greatest scam or prank in history. Hats off to you!Storyline doesn't make sense and the dialogues are intolerable. I wanted to walk out but my wife wouldn't let me because she thought the movie was gonna turn around.

"9450",2.5,"  What to say about this film. I liked about half of it, and at different points. Maybe it's because it felt like 3 different movies during each act. I will try not to spoil the movie but will probably explain basic elements of each act to demonstrate my point. So the first act felt like your typical college film about a young 20-something year old woman trying to make ends meet while living in busy London. That was fun, funny, not tomb raider, but overall fine. Once the second act begins (the adventure) it tries to become this mysterious quest surrounding questions about Lara's father. Overall this part of the movie is boring, uninteresting, and predictable. And the second act feels like it drags on forever. But the third act is where we get actual tomb raiding and adventure/action akin to the video game series. Really liked the third act. So the movie was a rollercoaster in terms of quality. If you're a fan of the two new video games (like I am) you might like, but other wise it's not that good. But its still not terrible enough to maybe wait for a matinee screening or redbox.","Tomb Raider",9450,2.7,0.2
"9451",0.5,"  Really disappointing, rubbish story line, nothing happens. Had potential but was a load of crap.","Tomb Raider",9451,2.7,2.2
"9452",1,"  With a plot that is full of logical flaws, and characters that don?t click, this verison of Croft often feels laughable, and not in a good way.","Tomb Raider",9452,2.7,1.7
"9453",5,"  I honestly think the main reason people are giving this film flak, is that Laura Croft doesn't have giant breasts and her body isn't a main focus of filming. Tomb Raider stands on its own story. To be fair, it isn't the g.o.a.t, but it is an engaging and entertaining film. It is certainly a fun film worth watching.","Tomb Raider",9453,2.7,-2.3

"9459",3,"  Don't let the reviews get you down, this is a fun action flick with a strong lead in the iconic role of Lara Croft. Following the story of the reboot 2013 Tomb Raider game, the story takes place on a lost island off Japan with the mystery of an ancient power and an evil force coming after it. It veers enough from the story of the game to keep fans guessing and it really helps the film stay grounded. There are problems, the lack of other major female characters makes the film feel a little unbalanced with a lot of male perspectives in a film that would have been far more interesting with other ideas. It also seems the budget of the film limited the scope of the production as there were some impressive elements of the game that would have improved the spectacle of the film. If you love action films and have an affinity with the Tomb Raider franchise I would recommend seeing this movie.","Tomb Raider",9459,2.7,-0.3
"9460",3,"  the movie was good, but the movie was only good because the only interesting character we got was Lara...","Tomb Raider",9460,2.7,-0.3
"9461",4,"  In my opinion this movie was quite an upgrade from the previous installments (starring Angelina Jolie) I really loved Alicia Vikander's performance as Laura Croft. It was a combonation of her acting ability and the writing of the character. I felt that this team had a better idea of what the games are like and stuck more to the source material. I enjoyed the development of the character in the beginning even if it were a little slower I think it will pay off especially if they have a sequel in mind. Really fun action flick.","Tomb Raider",9461,2.7,-1.3
"9462",3,"  At first i didnt have high hopes for this movie cause every game adapted movie has failed miserablely but from after seeing the movie it was better then i assumed. A bit of a average action origin movie but would have to be the best game adapted movie made so far and Alicia Vikander did brilliant as lara croft if there will be a sequal i'll look forward to seeing her return as the tomb raider and hopefully they can do a bit more with the movie.","Tomb Raider",9462,2.7,-0.3

"9464",5,"  Definitely different than the video game is based off of but quite enjoyable and a new twist on the same basic story. Alicia Vikander delivers a stellar performance. I hope to see more of her as Lara.","Tomb Raider",9464,2.7,-2.3

"9467",4,"  As far as video game to movie adaptations go, this movie is by far the best that I have seen. Any deviation from the video game canon only serves to amplify, and not detract from, the story and character development. This crossover grounds several of the elements that would be farfetched in reality but is commonplace in today's video games, and this makes this movie all the better. Better still, I found myself at the edge of my seat just as I do at home when the action sequences began. Alicia Vikander plays a wonderful Croft, not like the campy Jolie version. This movie is a must see for anyone who truly enjoys the Croft universe. 4 out of 5 for this highly enjoyable adaptation.","Tomb Raider",9467,2.7,-1.3
"9468",2.5,"  It was actually decent, once in to the movie it has a rocky start but a pretty good ending.","Tomb Raider",9468,2.7,0.2
"9469",5,"  Go see it, it's really good IMO.","Tomb Raider",9469,2.7,-2.3
"9470",4.5,"  Loved it, even for those who haven't played the game this is a thrilling adventure, Alicia Vikander is incredible in the role of Lara and I was surprised by how realistic the movie was, certain scenes are hard to watch as you can see the physical and emotional impact combat has on her character. I have a few problems with the movie that I wish wern't there but didn't significantly hurt my viewing, the music is pretty generic and the twist at the end was unnecessary and sequel- baiting. Despit these small flaws I definitely recommend this movie to fans of the game or general viewers.","Tomb Raider",9470,2.7,-1.8
"9471",4,"  Alicia Vikander makes an excellent and engaging Lara Croft. The story is slight and shows its video game roots with Lara leaping from obstacle to obstacle. It has all the improbabilities of most action films but Tomb Raider still manages to be fun.","Tomb Raider",9471,2.7,-1.3
"9472",3,"  Tomb Raider is one of the best video games movies to date. However, this is not saying too much as the translation from the console to the big screen has been subpar in general. Despite the poor reputation of video game movies coming into Tomb Raider, it holds its own as an enjoyable action thriller. The movie features a lot of elements from the 2013 reboot of the game, but differs with the story. Alicia Vikander is good as Lara Croft and holds true to the version portrayed in the 2013 reboot. Her backstory is a little different, as she chooses not to attend university and lives a quiet life in London, but this benefits Lara's character. We get to see her struggle in these early stages, and she builds and grows as a character when facing difficult situations throughout her journey. After getting arrested, she is bailed out by one of her father's business partners Ana Miller, where Lara receives her father's inheritance. This leads to clues and an adventure to the island of Yamatai in the Devil's Sea. Lara is accompanied by a ship captain named Lu Ren, who is a decent character, but does not receive the screen time to overcome his one dimensional presence. The story on the island is a little underwhelming and the pace moves very fast until the tomb is opened. This is where some of the sequences from the video game are featured however, and the best action scenes take place. The villain Mathias is very underused in the film. There are a few scenes where his intimidating and reckless presence are felt, but there is not enough of them to fully understand or care about Mathias. The story of the curse of the island stems away from the video game version, but still works. The Third Act is also very action packed, and tests Lara as a character, which builds on her arc from the First Act. The visuals of the movie are stunning, as the action sequences are very realistic and the camera angles add to the intensity and stakes of these. It can be a little unrealistic in the aftermath of some of these sequences, as Lara survives a lot and has very little physical injury. Overall, Tomb Raider is a step forward in the right direction for video games movies. Alicia Vikander provides a good interpretation as Lara Croft, providing great acting performance and her arc sees her grow as a character throughout the film. The story is a little underwhelming and differs from the source material in many ways, but the action and Lara's strong character make up for most of these flaws. The most important aspect of the Tomb Raider reboot is that the character of Lara is well cast and proves a strong and likeable character. This will bode well for potential sequels, as the plot can always be improved.","Tomb Raider",9472,2.7,-0.3
"9473",1.5,"  Boring! Dialogue incoherent","Tomb Raider",9473,2.7,1.2
"9474",4,"  Normally video game adaptation movies tend to flop due to its weak plot and poor execution on the tone, but 2018's Tomb Raider does not belong to that category as it exceeds my expectation. First off, Alicia Vikander is almost the perfect casting choice for Lara Croft as she is really a great actress and does have the looks and body shape for the character in 2013's Tomb Raider, the other casts such as Dominic West and Daniel Wu also did a good job on portraying their respective roles. It started off showing Lara Croft's life before she goes to her adventure with a fun tone and surprisingly realistic scenes. When Lara Croft arrived to the mysterious island, it has lots of cool action scenes with good CGI and fighting choreography that will make you get on the edge of your seat. This movie is not perfect by all means, its plot isn't something groundbreaking or original, and although Walton Goggins did provide a menacing antagonist, it does not have any backstory or character development to allow us to sympathize with his motives and intentions, they should've added a flashback with Lara Croft's father to let us know more about the character. Also, the pacing of the movie is a bit too fast as they tend to skip through the decisions of some of the characters without explaining too much. Overall, this movie is a lot of better than the two Tomb Raider movies by Angelina Jolie, and also provided a good origin movie if it does well enough to have a sequel for this franchise.","Tomb Raider",9474,2.7,-1.3
"9475",5,"  A decent plot, great CGI, action scenes are good and well executed. Not Perfect But Still Well Done. With that said, this is entertaining and a really fun movie to watch.Alicia Vikander carried the role beautifully","Tomb Raider",9475,2.7,-2.3
"9476",2.5,"  While there's certainly some fun to be had, an inactive and uninteresting protagonist where there should be one empowered and exciting brings an already bland story tumbling down.","Tomb Raider",9476,2.7,0.2
"9477",5,"  Loved the movie and reboot. Shows Lara from the very beginning. Loved her look and that the shorts were ditched.","Tomb Raider",9477,2.7,-2.3
"9478",3.5,"  Video game movies, for the most part, just completely fail, or at least are entertaining enough where it doesn't matter if they're bad (looking at you, RESIDENT EVIL series). This one didn't. I was satisfied with WARCRAFT and CASTELVANIA anime, and thought they were good enough to set a standard. This one went above the standard. And don't worry if the end is predictable; we've played the video games to know how it starts, and what are the environs. If Vikander wants or is willing to do another, that's fine with me.","Tomb Raider",9478,2.7,-0.8

"9482",4,"  I really enjoyed this new Tomb Raider. I think everyone should give it a chance! I don't see how its so much different than the cheesy ones with Angelina Jolie....except Vikander looks more human! My only slightly complaint is that they altered the video game plotline. Himiko was different in the video game. However, this is a good start to a new type of Tomb Raider. I really want to see another! PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER!","Tomb Raider",9482,2.7,-1.3
"9483",2.5,"  Well, I had awaited this flick with quite some anticipation, and while Alicia makes for quite a good representation of the young Lara, something just didn't come across as it should have. I felt the supporting cast was simply too cheap (B-movie actors) to have her face a worthwhile opponent. All in all it is watchable but it won't get you too excited. And I even watched it in a 4DX cinema. In a normal cinema one might feel a bit of drag. 5/10 points. One can, if one owns a big screen, easily wait for it to come out on Blue Ray or cable TV.","Tomb Raider",9483,2.7,0.2
"9484",3.5,"  There are some really good elements here - great performances and plenty of exciting action. Unfortunately, the story is so listless is barely gives anyone anything interesting to do.","Tomb Raider",9484,2.7,-0.8

"9491",3,"  The visuals in this film are amazing. A lot of scenes look like they have been taken straight out of the games, most notably the plane scene. Has a fantastic performance by Alicia Vikander and she really tries with the terrible script she was given. The other performances are mediocre at best. Overall, it was fine. 6/10","Tomb Raider",9491,2.7,-0.3

"9494",3,"  This is the ""exact tomb raider"" as we wanted to see. Alicia was really good on her character but still a complete bland plot was quite marred the whole movie. The whole action of the movie was quite similar to the game and the look of it as well.

"9497",3,"  Ms Vikander shows that she can act. She was very good in the dialogue driven scenes: and even better in the action sequences. The problem here is a weak story line. It did not make much sense. Also, the PC police seemed to be at work. Our very attractive heroine is captured by a murderous bad guy. The beautiful Ms Vikander is the only woman in sight. She is put to heavy manual work along with the male captives. There is no hint of potential sexual assault or even casual leering. She remains fully clothed in a steamy tropical location. This is not plausible. It was an OK trip to the flics.","Tomb Raider",9497,2.7,-0.3

"9500",0.5,"  This is a genuinely awful film, the only good thing about it will be seeing CinemaSins rip it to shreds. The plot is nonsensical, which can be forgiven because it's an action flick, but what I cannot excuse is that the action sequences in Ferris Bueller's Day Off are more thrilling.At a character level, this movie makes Lara a total idiot (NB mild spoilers ahead). Her marvellous plan at the start of the film is to agree to cause literally tens or hundreds of thousands of £ worth of criminal damage to get paid £600. Her plan in the middle of the film is to run off (injured) on her own with no food, water, medical supplies or WAY OF GETTING OFF THE ISLAND. Her plan towards the end is to strand a baddie by taking out the only escape route across a bridge - she is literally half way across the bridge at this point she could easily cross it to safety and take it down from the safe side, but no, she needs to go back to the side with the baddie so she can get stranded with him... Don't get me started on the magic reloading guns, the tomb-raiding party carrying everything including the kitchen sink, the boat trip to an island North East of Japan starting from Hong Kong... Ludicrous from start to finish.","Tomb Raider",9500,2.7,2.2

"9505",3.5,"  I kind of liked it. I have not played the recent games, but I remember the old ones (my dad played them and I watched and helped him). I do believe Alicia Vikander looks like Tomb Raider and the suspension of disbelief worked very well. It was a typical Tomb Raider-story, made less fantasy than the game actually was.I loved that in some scenes you really have the feeling you are playing the game. The graphics looked somehow different than in other movies.For my taste there could have been more puzzles to solve, but overall it was fine adventure-movie.","Tomb Raider",9505,2.7,-0.8

"9508",3.5,"  Not sure why no one is talking about the fact that it's easily the best video game adaptation ever.

Movie did a good job to combine the elements from both the movies.There were some issues that I found but overall a good action movie.","Tomb Raider",9508,2.7,-0.8

"9510",3.5,"  Ever since her father (Dominic West) disappeared from her life, Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) lives a carefree life in the city despite being the heir to his massive fortune. When she finally agrees to inherit her father's business and manor however, Lara discovers a secret office where she finds evidence that he might be alive on an uncharted island believed to hold a powerful treasure sought by the shady organization, Trinity.Aside from Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, Lara Croft is one of the most popular video game characters of all time. Ever since her creation in 1996 by the British video game company Core Design, this archaeologist has appeared in so many videogames, comics and even two live-action films with Angelina Jolie starring as Lara Croft, that her popularity even rivals that of Indiana Jones himself. Although most video-game film adaptations are mostly terrible train wrecks with the likes of Warcraft, Assassin's Creed and Uwe Boll's entire filmography, Norwegian director Roar Uthaug combines elements from the classic games with the gritter 2013 reboot of the franchise to create one of the better examples of the failing sub-genre with this rebooted origin story.The way in which the origin story of Lara Croft has been presented in this version is not that interesting compared with what was given in the 2013 game as the screenplay heavily relies on cliches and the tone is really inconsistent as it jumps back and forth between the fantasy tone of the classics and the grittiness of the reboot, that it becomes odd to watch at times.However, what makes this film better than the Angelina Jolie films and most other video-game films out there is that the screenplay does at least feel like a proper story that can entertain both fans and non-fans without alienating either and the action set-pieces, especially in the third act manage to incorporate elements of the gameplay within them such as the bow and arrow, grappling hook and puzzle-solving, without looking weird for people who don't play the games.Alicia Vikander, while not being as good as Angelina Jolie's more confident take on the character, does manage to get the look and the physicality of a mis-mash between the smaller 2013 Lara Croft and the more mature version of the original games right enough to be serviceable, while the likes of Dominic West, Walton Goggins and Daniel Wu do the best they can with their archetypes.Overall Tomb Raider may not be the best thing that the 22 year old franchise has to offer in terms of quality, but compared to what usually comes out for video game films on the big screen, being an OK film is equivalent to being outstanding in this sub-genre and one can hope that The Rock can overcome this hurdle with the upcoming Rampage film.","Tomb Raider",9510,2.7,-0.8

"9513",2.5,"  While Tomb Raider may have its appeal to the fans of the video games legacy, this new installment, just like in the past, fails in many areas, although not as badly. In particular, it comes short in it's somewhat meaningless plot and obnoxious action sequences. Additionally, the sound mixing could be better, there were parts of the movie when Lara Crofts (Alicia Vikander) grunts could be to clearly heard while she is running through the jungle and enduring gun fire. Junkie XL put together a decent original score, but even if it was as great as some of his other work like in Mad Max, it wouldn't be enough to bring this movie out of the tomb it's going to continue to bury itself under.","Tomb Raider",9513,2.7,0.2
"9514",1.5,"  Jolie dodged an arrow with this oneTOMB RAIDERWe continue to hope that this ""video game curse"" will be lifted by some divine spell that will come from the skies and change the whole panorama of this kind of movies but let me tell you that the only part that this has to do with witchcraft is the craft (or lack there of). You can't fake your way out of a lack of vision and a good eye, just as you can't fake your way out of a horrid screenplay. Tomb Raider belongs in that category of bad which comprehends any other movie you've seen and, granted you have the ability to percept repetition, you'll eventually forget. It's an extremely dull, mind-numbing piece of wannabe entertainment who falls into this modern pretence that tension isn't found in character, story or camera but in cutting 5 times faster than an audience's beating heart. And when you've seen many movies your heart starts to beat solely when a movie breaks out of the mold, when it shows me something exciting. In the end, when there isn't even an attempt to be original, you'll end up with a story which me, an experienced viewer, and even the general moviegoing audience will know by hard, bit by bit. Cinema, amongst other things, is about mystery, what you hide from the audience, so when you display all you have at once and all you have is an exact copy of the movie that preceded you, my compassion won't be won. Tension doesn't come from cutting but knowing when to cut. Action isn't a direct result of turning on a camera and shooting from 6 different angles and joining them together later, but from making decisions (tough ones). Maybe, when Lara is taking out a shard off her leg, instead of cutting 6 times, choose just one shot where the impact is unavoidable. If it's entertainment you want, make me feel entertained! I'll just end by saying that these are not the movies that will survive in a decade or so, these are the ones forgotten. And that is the only thing that is reassuring to me.","Tomb Raider",9514,2.7,1.2
"9515",3,"  The bar was low when I went to see this and while it certainly wasn't a masterpiece, I did find the movie to be relatively watchable and not as disastrous as reviews had made out. Obviously, the first rule of thumb with all movies of this type, is to suspend disbelief and once you do that you get a solid action movie. Alicia Vikander was surprisingly good in the role and supported well by the other actors, the action pieces were good and the dialogue while not highly original stuff, was not overly cheesy either. The plot was the real let down for the movie, it just wasn't strong enough. With a better plot, this could have been a better film.","Tomb Raider",9515,2.7,-0.3

"9518",4.5,"  If you like Indiana Jones movies, you will like this. I also like that Lara (Alicia V.) isn't a super sexy, vampy badass like her predecessor (Angeline) played her. She made the character more appealing, imperfect and believable for an unbelievable movie.","Tomb Raider",9518,2.7,-1.8

"9520",4.5,"  Alicia Vikander and Entertaining Action Set Pieces Help Tomb Raider Succeed.This incarnation of Tomb Raider is specifically based on the reboot of the Tomb Raider video game that came out in 2014. I have played that game and I came away from it being really impressed and hopeful for this movie (I picked it up on sale last year). So one of the things I was able to notice was how they did a good job of bringing in specific parts of the game and weaving them in organically. They borrow several of the action set pieces from the game and Lara uses the same weapons and tools. But the key thing is that they do it well and having played through the source material, they called back to it for the fans but you wouldn't be missing anything if you haven't played the game.Tomb Raider is another example of a project where casting talented actors and actresses makes the difference in making the material seem more believable. I initially thought Alicia Vikander was an odd choice for Lara, she's known better for acting in serious drama and this is a departure from that. But she nailed the role, she carried this movie instead of just slipping in as a cog. The supporting cast capably filled in their parts too. Dominic West was an improvement as Lara's dad over previous performances in the Tomb Raider series and he brings some genuine emotion and regret as Lord Richard Croft. I also enjoyed Daniel Wu as Lu Ren. I wish he and Alicia had a few more scenes together before they got to the island because they worked well together. The only disappointment was Walton Goggins and it wasn't his fault. He's such a fun actor to watch when he's on screen but he's so toned down it was like stripping a superhero of his powers. He's not bad, I just wanted a more animated Mathias Vogel and the character wasn't interesting enough for an actor of his calibre. I also want to credit Nick Frost and Kristin Scott Thomas for making the most of the material they're given to work with.Being an action/adventure film, the next thing that's on the checklist is that has to be there is some cool action. I wouldn't call this the next John Wick but Tomb Raider does have some thrilling moments. The beginning fight scene was a little choppy but the rest of it was fun to watch. The bike chase, the deserted plane and her fight in the jungle were all noteworthy and handled well. They lack the humour that something like Indiana Jones has but the set pieces are inventive enough and highlight this new version of Lara's strengths beautifully.I've been happy to praise Tomb Raider up to this point but there were some negatives that I'm going to point out. This movie could have benefited from some organic humour, Tomb Raider's jokes fall flat for the most part. One of the things that makes Raiders of the Lost Ark and the rest of the Indiana Jones series special is the fact that they can sell Indy as a bad@$$ action hero in one scene and in the next scene he's incredibly funny. A meta crack or two would have helped Tomb Raider float through some of the absurdity of the plot. The next and the biggest problem is that Tomb Raider can't parkour around some of the small plot holes as easily as Lara does around traps. From the motivations of some of the characters to the decisions that Lara, Richard, Mathias and Lu Ren make, there were some baffling choices. They didn't wreck the movie for me but they were big enough that I had to bring them up.I do want to finish by saying they took a unique turn with the ending that was pretty clever. A lot of movies in this genre are content to chalk things up to spirituality or magic when we get to the ending (the video game does but you don't mind it so much in the game). Tomb Raider takes a different direction with trying to being a little more practical and bring it closer to reality. This was definitely a nice touch and I appreciated that.Even though I would describe Tomb Raider as I movie I enjoyed instead of loved, when I was sitting in the theatre, I found myself wondering why we can't have more movies like it. I love adventure movies and while this movie borrows from the classics, they do some fresh things to separate from the pack. It seems like a genre that could use some more attention and I understand bringing in Tomb Raider to fill that hole. I think the cast and the action lift this movie over the problems the script has. If we're lucky enough to get another one (which isn't a sure thing, the box office returns for Tomb Raider so far aren't going to blow anyone away) hopefully they learn from this one. I still recommend Tomb Raider to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.","Tomb Raider",9520,2.7,-1.8
"9521",3.5,"  While not being the most original film with a predictable plot I found this reintroduction of the character to be thoroughly entertaining and engaging.

"9522",3.5,"  I personally enjoyed this movie and i thought it was a light in shining darkness for video game movies. The plot did take a stupid turn at one point but i thought towards the end that it redeemed that aspect of itself. Loved the main actress, didn't care for the supporting actor. He was good but his character was undermined and pushed to the side.","Tomb Raider",9522,2.7,-0.8
"9523",5,"  You can't replace Angelina Jolie as Tom Raider, but I thought Alicia Vikander played the character great!","Tomb Raider",9523,2.7,-2.3
"9524",1,"  Blotchy transition. The cast has no acting ability except the ones playing Lu Ren, the man coughing in the jungle, the Croft business partner/ friend, the workers and some of the fighters. Lara Croft's actress can't pull off the lines albeit the lines are often so basic, cheesy, and virtually cut-pasted. She's just not suited for the role though she tries. She did have some good action sequences. The father seemed to have potential but upon meeting him at the jungle that seemed lost. I know that Tomb Raider games and movies are so fantastical it's exciting, but there is always that element of "" Ok if I were there I would have done this...or this..."" It's fantasy that allows us to feel as though it could be true if only for 1.5 hours. But not here. The jungle vines seem fake. The temple door has such a perfect circular cut in the stone after it was bombed open?!? And it couldn't be open with the bombs? And the people are on an island for 7 years when all they had to do was what they did in the end.... ? No one thought of that? The smugglers were going in and out often bringing in equipment and bombs lol... The father is some intellectual but a Moses looking dude while everyone else is pretty neat and clean? The queen comes up in a random Halloween booby trap... THAT was supposed to be the wow factor....Some of the computer effects: the boat crash, the airplane, the end run scene where fine but again not believable. Also couldn't the father just have cut his arm off???","Tomb Raider",9524,2.7,1.7
"9525",5,"  This movie was much better than the critics thought it would be. Saw it with my 11-year-old daughter and she really loved it, too, although the dark tomb and music scared her a bit (due to her age). She found is as thrilling as the original Indiana Jones movie and liked seeing a positive female role model and would love to see this series continue. They should change the name, however, to Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, so they can launch a Lara Croft series of movies that aren't limited to tombs every time. Alicia Vikander also rocks as a realistic and extremely intelligent adventure hero. My daughter and I highly recommend this movie to our friends and family!","Tomb Raider",9525,2.7,-2.3

"9527",0.5,"  WHERE TO EVEN BEGIN, THIS MOVIE tried to copy the plot of the tomb raider game from 2013 and failed. it was nothing but lazy writing as they copied himiko and yamatai straight from the game while still trying to add a twist to the story. These writers are nothing but talentless hacks because the story for both the setting and himiko were already taken and if they were going to put an entirely new spin on what himiko was they should have just made a new story. But they didn't, which shows you how pathetically untalented these people are. Some things to note: 1) They changed Himiko from sun queen to some goddess of death 2) they introduced an evil organization named trinity that seeks to control the supernatural, and that they hired mercenaries to get Himiko's power, which replaces the game's original idea of stranded madmen that knew that they were being kept on the island by an unnatural force and wanted to find an ancestral link in Lara's friend, Sam, in order to sacrifice Sam to Himiko so that they may be freed from the island (Long story very short).so they copied the game plot but removed lara's asian friend sam, which in the game, served to be the reason that lara pursued the villains of the island she was trapped on. Sam was taken and Lara, being a loyal friend went to save her; bringing Lara into direct confrontation with people trying to kill her and thus leads to the development of lara's fighting abilities. At first, she struggled with killing people, which was entirely reasonable as this is her first encounter with bad situations. The game lays out the foundation for Lara's development in both skill and character from the beginning, but the movie does not succeed in any character development of Lara at all. Instead, it was so condensed that we could hardly see a city girl develop into an explorer, and the main reason she went after the mercenaries was because her father was written into the script to be alive on the island and that he said some DISAPPOINTING things to her because she didn't burn his notes like he asked. Is that really the kind of motivation for a city girl with no background of violent encounters to suddenly risk life and limb and go toe to toe with ruthless mercenaries? no, it is not, and it's infantile and stupid.Next, we see the writers try to copy the game's original wound near Lara's hip, but that just makes the whole writing seem even more lazy. In addition, the ice axe was an important part of Lara's arsenal in the game, where Lara had to climb on multiple OCCASIONS and use it as a weapon as well. HOWEVER, the movie had decided to introduce it without Lara needing to climb anything serious at all. Instead it was brought out later (ALONG WITH THE USE OF THE BOW AND ARROW) as a marketing ploy to draw the connection to the game. Lara only used it once, and we didn't even see snow. There was no point for these mercenaries to have it at all, and out of all the weapons available, that was the most pointless one she could have picked. Next was her fight with the main antagonist, and she honestly threw her ice axe on the ground so that she could jump on a shaky ladder connecting the pathway into Himiko's chamber to the entrance of the cave so that she could go toe to toe with a trained mercenary. On this shaky ladder, she also decides to use plenty of kicks, which is stupid and pure nonsense. This might seem petty for a movie, but the whole point of the Tomb Raider reboot was precisely to be more realistic and show a vulnerable character grow into the explorer we all knew her to be, and neither the experienced Lara Croft, nor the inexperienced Lara Croft would kick someone while standing on a ladder hanging above their drop to the death. Of course, the whole fight scene was pointless as she drives the antagonist back from the ladder and in towards Himiko's cave only to kick the ladder down anyways. All of this pointless crap just to say the most eye-rolling catch phrases ever. Finally, their twist on Himiko was that there was nothing supernatural about her, that she was a carrier of a disease that killed anyone by her touch. Not only does this go against all the adventures of Tomb Raider, but unfortunately they introduced trinity as the organisation that seeks to control the supernatural; and they were active on Yamatai, looking for Himiko's power. So they introduce an organisation that seeks out the supernatural to increase their power and they merely introduce a disease, it simply doesn't work. Honestly, Richard's (Lara's father) description of trinity could be wrong, this would have been a nice twist, perhaps for a later installment after they introduced Trinity earlier on and actually introduced Trinity as an organisation that went after supernatural power only to uncover a disease; however, with a bare minimum introduction, the lazy writing and theft of the plot of the Tomb Raider 2013 game, I believe that the writers unintentionally contradicted themselves here. They are that bad. The writers should be fired for having no talent and sent to prison for their theft and destruction of a great story and character.","Tomb Raider",9527,2.7,2.2
"9528",5,"  Loved it. Not sure why the critics hated it. It was exactly what you would expect from a movie based on a video game. critics seem to all love obscure boring movies just to prove they are artistic and objective... but the fact that they think alike proves they are lemmings completely out of touch with the general public they are supposed to serve. tomb raider never stood a chance with critics.","Tomb Raider",9528,2.7,-2.3
"9529",3.5,"  You know what? I liked it. At least a little bit. It doesn't have the same, campy fun as the original movie has, but it trades that out for a main actress with an amazing performance who isn't defined by sex appeal, and a story that, yes, has some structural and pacing issues, still manages to be faithful to the source material while being easy to follow and overall enjoyable. Would I recommend this to people who aren't fans or haven't seen the original? Eh, probably not, but I wouldn't say skip it or run away from it if you aren't interested. But if you're a tag-along to someone who wants to see it, I think you'd be surprised.","Tomb Raider",9529,2.7,-0.8
"9530",3.5,"  quite impressed to be honest, the movie takes its time. it builds the flaws of Croft which is a total different tone then what we are used to from the orgininal movies. Vikander does an amazing job carrying this movie, there are some scenes where she blew me away with her acting. the one thing the movie lacks is as much action as I expected, I really hope this does well enough for a sequel because I really loved this","Tomb Raider",9530,2.7,-0.8
"9531",2,"  The acting is a generally cringeworthy, but some are better than others. Attempts at comedy & sentimentality miss the mark more often than not. Most big set piece action sequences are really good, (the bike chase through london was done well), but the chase through the docks is a pointless waste of screentime. Overall scene should have been allowed to play out in longer cuts rather than trying to needlessly build tension with fast editing and stupid sound effects. The hired goons that make up the army personnel are terrible, people are smarter than that and have more soul/personality.The Himoko story line was badly fleshed out, lara's father's obsession is bordering on insanity with little evidence as to why he is actually obsessed (fair enough your wife died, but get a grip man and move on - flashbacks are a cheap way to fill out backstory and don't work here)","Tomb Raider",9531,2.7,0.7
"9532",5,"  Very entertaining. Good acting, good action, good stunts, all good","Tomb Raider",9532,2.7,-2.3
"9533",3.5,"  At just under two hours, Tomb Raider feels a bit long in the tooth by the time the credits roll, especially with the bulk of the first act feeling largely inconsequential, and the final ten minutes being devoted to laying the groundwork for an inevitable sequel. But the core elements - Lara using a combination of intelligence and athleticism to solve puzzles, outwit adversaries and navigate thrilling action beats - are superbly entertaining, and this outing may provide the film series with the same jolt of life enjoyed by its video game counterpart.","Tomb Raider",9533,2.7,-0.8
"9534",3.5,"  Is tomb raider... actually kind of good? This movie had some serious pacing issues around the middle, but overall it extremely exciting and fun to watch, and it actually had a lot of tension. It was a decent movie in general, which for a video game adaptation is amazing. This is basically the Dark Knight of video game movies.","Tomb Raider",9534,2.7,-0.8
"9535",3,"  I think Alicia Vikander is a great Lara Croft and I've really enjoyed the beginning with an inexperienced Lara in combat and without being the rich heiress, but someone normal; the problem begins with the development of the plot, which is simple and they don't stop explaining it again and again as if we were stupid to get it, the father and daughter scenes are repetitive, bored and they don't have chemistry for you to believe it also and this hurts me so much is that is a movie whose action scenes are very similar to those of the new video games (almost the entire movie) but the characters are horrible, the villain's motivation and evil are pathetic and there is no group dynamics with the sailor (I don't remember his name) I still do not understand at what point he begins to worry so much about Lara to the point of risking his own life ...It is a short and mediocre copie and paste of the stories and action scenes of both new video games but with mediocre and stereotyped characters, I miss the group dynamics that the characters of the video games or the old Lara Croft had.","Tomb Raider",9535,2.7,-0.3
"9536",3,"  This was a movie I was looking forward too. I've always been a fan of the Tomb Raider games so it was great to see it back on the big screen. As origin stories come, it's a good character one but it falls into the usual pitfalls and cliches of an action hero, or heroine as the case may be, movie.Lara's father died on a mystery trip to find an ancient supernatural being called Himiko and Lara has been in denial since. In the 7 years, Lara has not accepted her inheritance because it means it would confirm her fathers death. There is so much emphasis on the relationship between Lara and her father and we are constantly reminded of it in the film. So much so that you could see what was going to happen, no matter how much I didn't want it to. Lara eventually gets to the island and low and behold, finds her father alive. This was something that really annoyed me. The origin of Lara is that she picks up her father's love of tombs and interests and carries on his legacy, something that can't be done if he is alive. By the end of the movie, Lara's father does die and in turn, she will carry on her fathers legacy but I felt it was unnecessary for him to be alive and something we have seen before.Another thing that we have seen before is the 'supernatural being' that will destroy all mankind if found so it has to be stopped. It did have interesting mythology and in the end, I enjoyed the twist that it was a disease and Himiko was sacrificing herself so it didn't spread. It was better than the VFX monster I thought we were going to get, but at the same time it did feel very general. For this type of movie, this is the standard type of villain or goal if you will, it didn't bring anything new to the table.Tomb Raider is far from all bad and it's shining light is without a doubt, Alicia Vikander. Vikander really brings the character of Lara to life and humanises her. There was always a risk that the character would be very 'video-gamey' and she would not fear death and be good at everything. With Vikander, you can see the fear and the growth in Lara. Lara isn't good at everything and she makes mistakes and by the end, when she is in her signature pony tail and double handguns, it does feel earned and satisfying. You can tell Vikander really threw herself into the role and she has to be praised for it.The one thing this movie had to get right was it's use of puzzles and problem solving. It's the fundamental basis of why Lara Croft is a well loved character. It doesn't delve too far into puzzles but we get a few at the end and it's great to see Lara figure them out and save them from the brink of death. The set pieces in which Lara flings herself to safety, although questionable that she could really jump that far, they are great to watch and it does ramp up the tension.Once Lara is back in London, it seems like Lara stumbles on a bit of a conspiracy in the fact that this big bad company is actually owned by Croft Industries and it seems to set up future movies. I wish it had started this through out the movie. Drop Easter eggs and throw away comments the whole way through, it would have felt worthy of a sequel then as there would have been more unanswered questions. It does seem like the last 5 minutes are a little racked on in the hope of a sequel.DIAGNOSIS - MINOR TO MAJOR SURGERYTomb Raider falls into the usual plot points of a movie, father is dead, then alive, try and save the world from virus, save world. If we can look past the story and focus of the movie, we do get a really compelling character arc and it's great to see Lara grow into the Lara Croft we love. Vikander alone deserves to explore this character more and I think it would be good to see a whole movie as Lara Croft being the confident Tomb Raider. I hope it gets a sequel but stay away from dead family members and supernatural diseases!Matt","Tomb Raider",9536,2.7,-0.3
"9537",0.5,"  Ok, so you know how everyone dislikes less flashy marvel superheroes and hates their mindless origin stories? So what we essentially have is an origin story of low-tier superhero. This unappetizing meal is garnishied by politically correct AND no-name casting. Entire movie is literally shots of some groups of men of random racial attunement, mixed up with attempts of our brave soldier Jane, the only somewhat redeemable character in the flick, to outplay them. The plot is beyond atrocious; nothing bad guys ever do makes sense. Same goes for acting. I was taking 2 year break from going to movies, and the first thing i see is this piece; the break was caused exactly by being subjected to a movie of a same caliber of quality, the Equals.

"9541",3,"  After a long plagued history of dogged video game movies, it's assuring to call this one at least ""okay"". Alicia Vikander fits into her action-loving character like a glove - and thankfully with zero female objectification. The effects and designs also deserve mention.

Being a mega Tomb Raider fan for the past 15 years now, I was worried how this movie would live up to the character of Lara Croft and her type of adventures (Alicia Vikander was an odd casting choice in my eyes). However, after seeing this movie, I can proudly say it holds the Tomb Raider spirit and effectively portrays the new Lara Croft. Vikander's small intricacies in her performance really sold me on her Lara. The story was interesting and full of tense moments, and the visuals were top notch. Many of the action scenes were genuinely gripping. I was a bit disappointed with the big reveal of Queen Himiko's powers towards the end, it didn't have the oomph I was hoping for.Overall, a fun, thrilling, well-acted video game movie that lives up to the franchise it comes from.","Tomb Raider",9543,2.7,-1.8

"9546",3,"  Tomb Raider is a step in the right direction for video game movies, although a rather minor step; the movie plays it safe, avoiding being either dreadful or great. At least I can say it was mildly entertaining. A decade has passed since Angelina Jolie portrayed Lara Croft and now someone new is taking a stab at the role - Academy-award winning actress Alicia Vikander. Vikander gives the character a higher degree of authenticity; each grunt and scream that follows her colliding with a tree or doing something else dangerous actually sounds like it is coming from the actress. The sounds are not masculinized to obvious falseness and make Croft appear the vulnerable young women she is. Vikander's Lara still has the high-level of courageousness and toughness of the traditional character while still appearing genuine. It is Vikander's portrayal of Lara Croft that is the standout element of the film; the movie focuses less on the sex appeal of the character and more on the heroism she possesses. Walton Goggins plays the villain, ""Mathias Vogel."" While his performance is fine, there are flashes of intensity and intimidation from him here and there, the character himself is as bland as they come. Vogel is no more than the ""gun-toting psychopath"" the movie describes him to be. To call him a villain is even a stretch as the only true intention he has is far from evil since all he wants to do is leave the island and get home to his family. With a weak antagonist and an uninspired origin story, the film is both plain and forgettable. Lara Croft heads out to an island where she believes her father vanished, runs into a guy that likes to shoot people, and has to stop him from getting his hands on a supernatural tomb or else there will be astronomical consequences. It sounds like something you would get out of an Indiana Jones flick. However, Indiana Jones was great because its characters made the sometimes-cheesy plots entertaining. In Tomb Raider, there is only one significant driving force, and that is Lara Croft herself. The side characters lack value and as mentioned earlier, the antagonist does little to push Croft forward. Daniel Wu might have had a chance as a side character if he had been given a reasonable amount of screen time. The story and movie suffer from these faults. The latest Tomb Raider reboot is two hours long and yet only feels one-and-a-half; time flies by fast. The action scenes are cool no matter how exaggerated some may be. There is almost never any downtime. If the scene is peaceful one moment you can bet that something will happen to change that. I had a fine time watching Tomb Raider and believe if the writers can get a little more inspired there is value in creating a sequel and continuing the newest form of the franchise; but based on what I saw, I can't help but call Tomb Raider merely average.","Tomb Raider",9546,2.7,-0.3
"9547",3,"  Alicia Vikander certainly makes this saga worth watching. There was more of a plot played out than what I was expecting. The action sequences are well choreographed, although some appear far more like a game than natural, which I suppose should be expected. It?s fun entertainment.","Tomb Raider",9547,2.7,-0.3
"9548",5,"  I loved the grounded approach to the story. I think a story is always better when there is at least an attempt at plausibility. Tomb Raider delivers on that while still providing plenty of good action. I rather liked the background story, so I don't know what the critics are complaining about. It makes Lara a very real person that many people can relate to, not just some rich girl with a taste for action. Despite the rating by critics who almost always get it wrong, and fanboys who would have rather seen a big tit Lara, I highly recommend this movie!","Tomb Raider",9548,2.7,-2.3

Lots of stunts, including four or five hanging by one hand over a something or other. She also has a Elf Quiver that never runs out of arrows.

I hope someone decides to make a sequel because it's ending definitely made doorways to other movies.

"9555",2,"  You know what you haven't heard enough about recently? That's right, identity politics, and I'll bet for movies in particular representation has hardly even come up. Well just leave it to me, a white, cis-hetero male to man-splain or, if you will, com-man-plain (?) about our cinematic paradigm and the shift that should be happening but isn't (even though it seems like it is). In the past year or two there have been a spate of films that have broken the mold for representation in Hollywood, and for all the avid audience members that cheer triumphantly at a particular casting decision or character trait, there is a white, cis-hetero man with tears welling up in his eyes for joy at the steady increase of his bank account. Ultimately, it's people like Kevin Feige who are on cloud nine when a movie like Black Panther dominates the box office, and people like Jim Whitaker who taste the pain when a movie like A Wrinkle in Time will most certainly fail.Admittedly, it is a cynical viewpoint to consider only the financial results of a film and who benefits from it the most. After all, Ryan Coogler will have a massive budget on whatever his next film is if he doesn't get resigned to the Mediocre-Superhero-Cinema-Industrial-Complex. He will probably cast as many people of color as he can fit into the movie because he can and probably should. As proven by the Oscars this year, Hollywood is a diverse, splendorous world where all are freely invited to spend their money. They have always had a one-size fits all attitude about what a film can be about and who it's for. Up until a few years ago, the size that fit all consisted of diverse casting, but not too diverse because they didn't want to alienate the WmiddleHaged,ImiddleTclassE demographic who frequented theaters the most.See, it's not just finances, it's marketing too. Since we've had a p(l)easant three decades of Reagan America's ""War on the Poor"", the dwindling middle class and the even more dwindling movie-going public have become the diverse melting-pot of ethnicities, races, genders, and sexual identities that we were told America is supposed to be all about. So it's no wonder that gender and race inclusive casting seems awesome in the cultural vacuum of the few people who actually still want to go to a theater and the film makers who need to make money off of them. However, it reeks of hollow lip service to pretentious assholes like moi. ""Think of the children"" one may retort, ""finally, they have heroes to look up to that look like them."" There's the problem: I don't like children - regardless of race, gender, and nationality. There are too many of them, the world owes them nothing, and they are annoying especially in a movie theater and most of the time on film.This is at the heart of my argument, there's a massive problem with the glorification of nostalgia and childhood. It allows film makers to be even more lazy with themes, dialogue, plot logic, and character development than usual. Nothing more is expected past a certain intellectual threshold, and it is childish in every sense of the word. Wonder Woman is strong and cunning, and that's it. Black Panther is strong and cunning, and that's it. It's not a new thing. There have always been these stoic and simplistic archetypal leads filling an anthropomorphic hole in their respective films, but that was before CG sucked the soul out of everything surrounding the Person with No Name. A constant upping the ante of fantastical environments has led to a clinical and critical shortcoming of major productions. These worlds and characters are transient thrills to fill a progressive atrophy in imagination. They are hot-button trigger words to trick you into aligning with a blank canvas of a character for reasons almost completely external to the films they inhabit as opposed to experiencing a fantastical world through the open eyes of a timeless character. They've overspent their value as pre-nostalgic set-pieces for the sake of a quick buck and at the cost of your attention. It's another superficial ""by the numbers"" decision to maximize revenue.It wouldn't be so bad if these characters had some insightful sense of depth. I'm not talking about an elaborate set of titles and fart-box MacGuffin swords they acquired on the magical Neptunian archipelago of Antarctica. I'm talking about real human emotion. I'm talking about strange and terrifying ethical conundrums that changed them as people, deep-seated regrets that haunt them at night, splendorous moments where they felt connected to something beyond love and thought - not fate and destiny and that one guy who died or that one guy who killed everybody that always seem to be the stand-ins for character motivation. Everything is spelled out unambiguously and simplistically because if an audience is left to ruminate about something too long, they will probably get out of their seats and trash the theater in a mass hissy fit like the children they are assumed to be. I feel bad for the races, genders, ethnicities, and orientations being represented in these movies because the audience they are meant to embody are being talked down to and sold short.Lara Croft, the titular Tomb Raider, is a woman who is overly capable of a decathlon, but most importantly, she is a pre-existing IP that is easily capitalized upon amidst our socio-political disdain for patriarchy despite the fact that every motivation she has is in service to or as a reaction to her daddy (who loves her, as we are reminded through constant flashbacks). The plot is a mixture of the vastly superior Raiders of the Lost Ark and the similarly crappy The Mummy (2017). This pisses me off because Alicia Vikander is a great actress who should be in more movies, but here she is given a boring, sexless, ersatz-empowerment role in a film where her character might as well have been played by a blue chimpanzee, or worse, Tom Cruise. I'm sorry if what I'm about to say will irreparably crush your nine year old daughter's dreams of becoming the President of Earth, but this movie sucks.","Tomb Raider",9555,2.7,0.7

Otherwise, this was just another really bad and seriously unnecessary reboot of a franchise that was bad in the first place.","Tomb Raider",9563,2.7,1.2
"9564",3.5,"  Tomb Raider brings back pieces of the best parts of the series while allowing itself to set new standards for the franchise on screen. Although, many of Lara Croft's motivations seem slightly uninspired and sporadic, it's still an exciting and entertaining experience.","Tomb Raider",9564,2.7,-0.8
"9565",3,"  Alicia Vikander is great, there's some excellent action that reminds you of the game (in a good way) and there's a decent mystery/puzzle/trail making up the plot. It's got problems but there's lots to enjoy too!","Tomb Raider",9565,2.7,-0.3
"9566",3.5,"  Led by a strong performance from Alicia Vikander, Tomb Raider is a fairly harmless popcorn movie with glimmers of potential, at least whenever the story avoids the video game elements.","Tomb Raider",9566,2.7,-0.8
"9567",2,"  Plenty of suspense, but this movie is inferior to the previous Tomb Raider movie series and honestly has some pretty boring scenes. I was expecting more from the actual tomb itself too. Those scenes fell way below expectations...eh.","Tomb Raider",9567,2.7,0.7
"9568",4,"  It was so much fun to watch this new lara croft reboot. I like how it starts at the very beginning. Even if you have never played any of the games your not missing anything. I am hoping for a sequel.","Tomb Raider",9568,2.7,-1.3

"9572",3.5,"  This movie step up with a new champion who added a grit and humanized the Lara Croft character. Alicia Vikander has brought to Lara what Danial Craig brought to James. You see he bleed and can feel her pain. She can get her butt kicked but pick herself up and kick back. The movie sets up the relationship with her father which will drive her in to sequels to be more the Lara that we know. I enjoyed the movie the narration and scrip could use some work and the plot was typical and predictable but Alicia Vikander is a Lara I can look forward to seeing again.","Tomb Raider",9572,2.7,-0.8
"9573",4,"  My kids and I enjoyed this show. Fun entertainment. The plane and waterfall scene was suspenseful. Not as good as a Raiders of the Lost Ark but entertaining and fun. I am posting a positive review and we will likely see it again.","Tomb Raider",9573,2.7,-1.3
"9574",3,"  While the storyline is generic, Alicia Vikander's performance elevates this movie above all other video game films. It is certainly not a masterpiece, but definitely a step in the right direction.","Tomb Raider",9574,2.7,-0.3
"9575",4.5,"  I really like this movie, glad it is set up for sequel. It is a video game scripted movie and was really good at being just that. It was really entertaining, never slow.

"9576",2,"  Never saw the original, so don't know if this version is better or worse. I did find it comical that Kroft is shooting arrows, while everyone else is using machine guns. She can hit her targets, while the guys shooting guns can't.","Tomb Raider",9576,2.7,0.7

"9579",1.5,"  In 2001, Angelina Jolie brought to life a video game character and added a sense of humor, fun, and sexiness that makes these characters appealing. While the Jolie Tomb Raider movies are not memorable in terms of story, there is no denying that she made a memorable character. Alicia Vikander's turn at this origin story leaves much to be desired, not in terms of acting, but in terms of caring. We simply don't get to care enough about Lara because there really isn't much there to care about. As a result, we don't really care that much about the story, her relationship with her father, or whatever secret shadow organization is pulling the strings for the inevitable sequel. There are some great action sequences, but they run just a little bit too long, making them more of a chore to get through than fun to watch. Here's hoping that any future installments will be a lot more fun.","Tomb Raider",9579,2.7,1.2
"9580",0.5,"  This actress isn't good to be Lara we all deserve. Her rettagnle face just cant be watched for whole time od movie, i really regret i spend my money for this.","Tomb Raider",9580,2.7,2.2
"9581",5,"  I was extremely impressed by how well Alicia portrayed Lara. While the other films were amazing, they felt more like a video game (which they are) but this one feels more like a true action film to me! This movie makes me feel like I'm in the world of Lara and the other characters. I was amazed by the stunts. In an interview I briefly heard Alicia talking about doing stunts but I wasn't sure if they were done all by her. Props to whoever did them! They were amazing! Alicia can fill Angelina's position quite well and I'd look forward to seeing another Tomb Raider film or a film following Lara Croft.","Tomb Raider",9581,2.7,-2.3

"9585",0.5,"  It's Lara Croft, that watched and could not believe what this actress took on this role, they took replaced the Canon, it's not ""tomb raider, and some survival of"" okay game, but the film, we waited for 17 years that used here she played A. Vikander, where she for this role, it is not like, not canonical, is another issue Vikander is that it does not feel of aristocracy, rather, it is suitable for the role of Jessica Jones or Bella from ""Twilight"" or the heroine of ""the hunger games"", a kind of normal girl from a small American town (actually Swedish). There in her eyes no anger, no pain, no adventure, only anxiety tired rabbitIt's funny that the story eventually plays the theme of survival, which was stated in the promo for the game, but in reality the game was absent. To survive Vikander can, and to be a Lara Croft - is unlikely. ( to the actress I'm good, but that's not her role, it's a pity the petition never came to the bosses of the film). Lara Croft, which is not in different parts of the world riding and gets into different adventures, and survives almost the entire film in one location, I sincerely want that b was not continued and, God forbid, by 5 to 10 years will restart again with the Canon actress","Tomb Raider",9585,2.7,2.2
"9586",2,"  Forgettable and boring. This Tomb reboot is undoubtedly action-packed and enthusiastic, but fails to deliver in the narrative, hanging precariously onto the missing father - pining daughter trope that was more irritating than endearing. Couldn't help pining for Angelina Jolie who looked more the part of Lara Croft than Alicia Vikander.","Tomb Raider",9586,2.7,0.7

"9589",5,"  I didn't expect anything like Black Panther, and it was plenty good. Story was entirely predictable through the second half, but it was sufficiently fun to earn a bunch of stars.","Tomb Raider",9589,2.7,-2.3
"9590",3.5,"  My ratings aren't polished in the least bit. Just a warning. Considering that it's a movie based on a video game, it's pretty good. The father daughter connection was definitely a great direction to take. I don't know what it is. It almost feels like I'm watching video game cinematic scenes sometimes. Objectively, this may not be the film's fault. Perhaps the mere fact that I know it's based on a video game unfairly colors my opinion in a negative way. Overall, it's a solid competent action movie. With a good attempt at balancing the action with character development and story.","Tomb Raider",9590,2.7,-0.8
"9591",3,"  I went in with low expectations and ended up liking the movie. I think Vikander is great and I love her version of Lara. She's not just a physical bad ass, but also has human qualities and makes mistakes. She's also intelligent without being too clever. The plot was a bit boring and paint by numbers but some of the action was great. Overall not a bad movie.","Tomb Raider",9591,2.7,-0.3

"9598",5,"  This action movie had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved it! I like that it is filled with lots of suspense and tense moments that make you feel as if you are inside the scenes. I love when a movie draws me in like that, because there are unexpected surprises. What also attracted me is the actors' work and the impressive way they portray the characters that make you feel as if you are with them and feeling what they are going through. The storyline and the actors combined make you forget what is going on around you and focus on the interesting film that is unfolding right in front of you. The storyline is about Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander), the independent daughter of an adventurer who mysteriously disappears for years. Croft embarks on a journey to find her missing father, in hopes to solve the mystery of his disappearance. She goes off to a weird destination she reads about in one of her father's journals and leaves without hesitation. Even though the destination is a tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan, she leaves with the drive to find out what happened to him. Lara must trust herself, mind, and spirit, to make it out alive of this adventure. My favorite scene is when Lara is stuck on the airplane and about to fall into a waterfall. This scene markes the moment when I most felt as if I was living this tough moment with her and the one that completely drew me. It is a complex scene where she finds herself at the top of a waterfall almost falling and then, finds an old helicopter that she can hold unto. She gets on top of the helicopter, but later realizes that the old helicopter is breaking down and she has to get out of there as soon as possible. Watching her go through all that without falling made me feel super anxious and nervous, as if I was in the scene with her. The important messages of this film are to never give up and to always fight for what you believe is the right thing to do. In the movie, Lara always has this drive to accomplish any goals she sets herself to complete. I think that is the secret for all challenges in general and all the objectives Lara reaches in the film. You need to believe in your abilities to achieve the goals you want and need to have the motivation that helps get you there. I rate this film 5 ot of 5 stars and recommend it for people from 13 years old to 18, as well as adults. reviewed by Alejandra g., kids first! film Critic.

"9600",3.5,"  A Lara Croft who's top priority is survival rather then looking cool. This is a mix of Katniss Everdeen and Indiana Johns. This is a movie that took the best things from the video games, and made into a cinematic experience.","Tomb Raider",9600,2.7,-0.8
"9601",4,"  I lile the treatment they give to Lara Croft, she is no longer a walikung pair of gigantic boobs, she feels relatively real.","Tomb Raider",9601,2.7,-1.3
"9602",5,"  An inspiring adventure that fulfills every expectation I had. Alicia Vikander, Dominic West, Walton Goggins and all the other actors seem to be made for their roles. Just as fresh was the harsh reality in contrast to the earlier Tomb Raider films, which is also due to the surprisingly unmagic but no less entertaining solution to the riddle of Yamatai. A classic masterpiece that draws you into a spell.","Tomb Raider",9602,2.7,-2.3
"9603",5,"  I loved it! I am a huge fan of the games and in my opinion the movie was incredibly made amd pulse-raising even though the plot was completely different from the game it was based on.","Tomb Raider",9603,2.7,-2.3
"9604",4,"  This film is an amazing adaptation of the new games, similar enough to exite fans yet new enough to surprise us. A lot of people are complaining that he body isn't as curvy as Angelina Jolie, but that's not the point of Lara, she's not a sex icon she's a powerful woman. As for the other complaints, it's an origin story and a brilliant one at that, the gun toting fully fledged acrobat Tomb Raider is clearly now set up for next time. I personally think this is the best game adaptation yet and loads better than the original Tomb Raider films that are only really popular because of physical attraction to Angelina's chest, as the story of that film is so weak compared to this one.","Tomb Raider",9604,2.7,-1.3
"9605",3,"  A very boring first hour and a half, filled with uniteresting characters and senseless plot developments. The movie starts getting good at the final half hour, but by then is too late. Unfortunately, Lara Croft is not the feminist icon everybody wanted her to be. Alicia Vikander does a fine job, but it is not one of the best female action characters by far.","Tomb Raider",9605,2.7,-0.3
"9606",4,"  In a genre dominated by men it's nice to know that strong women can be represented in the world of Archiological Mystery and Crime Fighting. But leave it to game makers to create a Bad-ass Barbie who still uses her over-sexed physique to get the job done. So when Hollywood came calling a decade ago it wasn't about ability to encompass a female version of Indiana Jones it was about who will pre-teen boys and gamers lust after that embodies the pixel-created Lara Croft? Jolie fit that mould perfectly. But 10 years later the world is different...or at least trying to be. Girls can be whoever they want. Woman are tired of being objectified. The age of Mad Men is past. A new Lara Croft can be imagined and she doesn't have to be tits and ass to get the job done. Alicia has the smarts and the chops. I'm going in to compare her to Jolie. They are not the same. As far as I'm concerned this is a stand alone movie with a cast that gets it done (albeit predictably). If you're looking for fantasy fodder grab a magazine of an unrealistic figure, if you're looking for strong female character with grit then grab a ticket and enjoy the adventure.","Tomb Raider",9606,2.7,-1.3
"9607",3.5,"  more believable than the Jolie versions, worth a view","Tomb Raider",9607,2.7,-0.8
"9608",3.5,"  Having played the games, I went into this movie with limited expectations for it to fill out the wonder of its source material. I found that as a possible movie franchise, I can see the direction it took in an origin story for this character -however, as a lover of the newer game reboot, I found it somewhat disappointing in the character's development. In the game, Lara is very autonomous and her reasoning for wanting to travel is purely internal motivation and does not rely on the crutch of having to figure out what happened to her father (as if you play the games, you know exactly what happens to him). She is already becoming an established archaeologist in the footsteps of her father - whereas in the movie she is still trying to figure out who she is. By the end of the movie, she does develop a sense of self, and the movie evades any of the extra CG with the supernatural elements that was brought to the game itself and instead opts for a more realistic allure for what is going on the island. Despite all this, the lead actress does a pretty good job on the portrayal of Lara and fits the role pretty well. The movie also omits a lot of the NPCs and instead adds in a newer character that you pretty much... don't care about, wheras the game left you with a sense of connection with them because Lara had already made connections with those people, like one is her best friend from college. They also lead with Trinity right out of the gate, replacing them with the island cult and didn't really develop them much. On the plus side, the movie is full of action that reminds you of the game and you're left with a sense of game mechanics being fulfilled, as well as a very entertaining action piece - and you're still left wondering how Lara is surviving any of this by the end of it. Overall it was a pretty entertaining action movie with a lead actress - I just was left with wishing that she wasn't being portrayed as needing to be saved and having more of an idea of her self worth in all of this. Going forward, I hope that the next movies will be a more confident Lara and fill in some of the expectations I had going into this movie as far as her character is concerned.","Tomb Raider",9608,2.7,-0.8
"9609",2,"  I hate when intelligent people makes stupid decisions","Tomb Raider",9609,2.7,0.7
"9610",3.5,"  Tomb Raider was an relatively enjoyable movie. The movie tries to establish the character before rushing into the plot and does a decent job. The visual effects are interesting and well done with a lot of detail and interesting imagery. The problem was it felt like a compilation of other movie scenes recast with a slightly new angle. Like looking at yourself in an angled mirror, same image but slightly different. The building collapsing as the star runs out, doom feet away. A chase scene to regain a stolen journal with important facts. A secret society and a ruthless bad guy who uses local people as slaves. Insert just about any Indiana Jones or Mummy movie here and I would say you have seen it. In summary, I don't regret paying to see this, but I would definitely recommend you wait for this to come out on TBS rather than pay for it yourself,","Tomb Raider",9610,2.7,-0.8

"9612",5,"  Probably one of the best computer game to film adaptations I?ve seen.","Tomb Raider",9612,2.7,-2.3
"9613",4.5,"  Attending a performance of the Edgar Wallace play The Case of the Frightened Lady later that day,I decided to go to town early in order to see a movie. Having found Alicia Vikander's film choices to always be at least interesting, and with co-star Walton Goggins The Shield being my favourite TV series of all time, I excitingly got ready to open the tomb.View on the film:Playing the two main men in Lara's life, Walton Goggins and Dominic West (Shane Vendrell meets Jimmy McNulty!) give fun performances as boo-hiss baddie Mathias Vogel and her reckless dad Richard,with Goggins firing up Vogel's years of desperation to find the tomb,and West bringing a joy out in Richard witnessing Lara follow in his footsteps. Leaping into the first raided tomb, Alicia Vikander gives an excellent take on Lara. Doing the hand to hand combat and running stunts herself, Vikander gives the action a real crunch with a fluid performance of each sweeping punch/jump. Set before Lara gets her hands on the family cash, Vikander brings out the vulnerability in Lara over the question of Richards disappearance.Inspired by the 2013 re-boot of the video game, the writers do very well at giving the origin set-up a lightness,as each piece revealed about Lara's childhood is pushed with the momentum of an adventure on the horizon. Going into Adventure Movie mode, the writers get Lara to face an exciting obstacle course, from Vogel's henchmen to fighting to avoid going downstream,and raiding her first tomb. Locking the tomb up with curses, the writers intriguingly make the main twist be a change in perspective on the reason for the tomb being built.Riding the wave of his Disaster movie The Wave,director Roar Uthaug & cinematographer George Richmond successfully adapt the video game with closely held camera moves giving the leaps in physics for the major CGI set-pieces a cover system atmosphere. Presenting Lara as a real sporty type, Uthaug and Richmond give the hand to hand combat scenes a rough and tumble mood, with crisp tracking shots following Lara's run to be the first tomb raider.","Tomb Raider",9613,2.7,-1.8
"9614",2,"  A painted by numbers film with horrible direction; filled with shaky-cam, mudded cinematography and painful expository dialogue. Wasted potential.","Tomb Raider",9614,2.7,0.7
"9615",5,"  When I watch movies based on video games they tend to be a failure. But not this one. This movie is based of the 2013 reboot of the same name and I loved the similarities it had to the game, Alicia Vikander did a great job portraying Lara Croft. Great cast enjoyable story, and did not want to miss a minute of it.","Tomb Raider",9615,2.7,-2.3
"9616",1.5,"  Angela was not ideal but this bitch sucks hind tit. Way too much SJW bullshit, way way worse than Angela.

Shitty work in general. Stop the SJW bullshit already.","Tomb Raider",9616,2.7,1.2
"9617",5,"  Awesome movie. Very realistic. Lead actor was very powerful. This could be compared with what Nolan did with the first batman to portray him as a human being, in this movie Lara was portrayed as real human. Worth watching.","Tomb Raider",9617,2.7,-2.3
"9618",3.5,"  Felt a bit lame on the scale of the National Treasure movies, but still enjoyable. Full of action and some spooky moments. Generally liked it. Is under 2 hours but drags a bit in the middle.","Tomb Raider",9618,2.7,-0.8
"9619",3.5,"  A much stronger video game film than most, even if it's not perfect. Lara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father's global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he's truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can't understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death. Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad's last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn't be higher for Lara, who--against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit--must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.Having played only a tiny bit of the Tomb Raider games so far and avoiding the adaptations with Angelina Jolie, I didn't really have a lot of expectations going into this film. Alicia Vikander has been a personal favorite of mine ever since ""Ex Machina"" so I'm excited whenever I get to see her performance again. On the other hand, video games have a history of being, well, shitty. Thankfully, this adaptation really wasn't too shabby, and there's plenty of fun to be had with it if you let yourself.One thing that was great about this film was the talent themselves. Alicia Vikander really took control. It didn't feel like her character was ever objectified or sexualized so that was certainly a plus. Vikander really made a name for herself and seeing how this movie ended, we'll probably be getting a sequel. Thankfully, she did great in her role. She was accompanied by a strong Asian counterpart in Daniel Wu and as an Asian-American myself, it makes me happy to see Asians getting bigger roles in Hollywood. One thing that was absolutely terrible, and I mean terrible about this film, was the editing / action sequences. It was obvious the choreography wasn't too great so the film relied on the jump cut method. In a single move, there could be 5 cuts that just made you disoriented. When one punch is thrown, they have to cut 5 more times just to hide the choreography flaws. This fell into the pit that is poor action and if it wasn't for the entertaining story, I probably would've been annoyed rather than entertained. Honesty, this film is just simple fun. I think it's fun to see Lara Croft and the kind of person she is. The story is iffy and not the most coherent, but the film is fun. The visuals are decent, or at least good enough for the most part. It's got a solid beginning and a thrilling end, so if I wasn't having fun that'd just be personal preference. It was a fun time and certainly better than expected.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It isn't without its flaws but it was certainly good popcorn fun.","Tomb Raider",9619,2.7,-0.8
"9620",4,"  I give this movie a positive review for Alicia Vikander's performance. Her Lara Croft is a bit more realistic than Angelina Jolie's. The movie had some tender moments like Lara discovering her dad. The story kept one's interest until the end which was ultimately unsatisfying as a plot resolution. I hope they make another one as Alicia deserves a better story.","Tomb Raider",9620,2.7,-1.3

Granted, there were a few moments that reminded me it was from a video game, but overall, this movie definitely had a higher quality to it than other video game movies out there. Tomb Raider tells the origin story of how Lara Croft becomes the titular Tomb Raider. After many long years of having her father missing and presumed dead, Lara decides to finally sign the necessary paperwork that would grant her permission of acquiring her father's inheritance, including ownership of his company. After unlocking an ancient Japanese puzzle box left to her by her father, Lara uncovers a secret that leads her to a perilous journey into a fabled island off the coast of Japan where she believes lies the truth of her father's disappearance and where an ancient power has lain dormant for centuries.Alicia Vikander was a great choice in playing Lara Croft, The improved writing for the movie along with her acting combine to make for a more humanized Lara than the ones depicted in past movies. As an adventure movie, this film had me engaged from beginning to end and it had a satisfyingly enough ending that I am now genuinely excited for a sequel to be made.","Tomb Raider",9634,2.7,-0.8
"9635",4.5,"  I really liked this movie. Alicia did an excellent job bringing Lara to life! Hope there's a part two!","Tomb Raider",9635,2.7,-1.8
"9636",3.5,"  Watched #TombRaider for Alicia Vikander. It was a decent reboot, but the franchise needs to work on differentiatiating itself from Indiana Jones. Looking forward to the inevitable sequel and more Vikander (3.5/5Scales)","Tomb Raider",9636,2.7,-0.8
"9637",2.5,"  I only watched this for Alicia Vikander's outfit, overall the movie was just forced and lacking story elements","Tomb Raider",9637,2.7,0.2
"9638",4,"  Lots of fun. Half the critics are idiots, just like half of America is comprised of idiots.","Tomb Raider",9638,2.7,-1.3
"9639",3.5,"  If you think about it as a stand-alone franchise then it's really good it build up backstory, it also sets it self up for at least one sequel. One big plot hole is that the ""villains"" were owned by mr Croft so surly he could cancel all funding to said ""villains"". But all in all a good film just big plot hole","Tomb Raider",9639,2.7,-0.8
"9640",5,"  Finally a video game adaptation that feels like the people who made it actually played the game. While trimming the story down to fit in a movie they managed to keep most the elements of the game. I didn't like how they basically switched Roth for Lara's Dad but I understand why they did it, to add a bit of emotion to it. I understand why they added the story on the start but personally I would have liked to see this part trimmed down a bit in exchange for more time on the island.Overall I think they did a great job and can't wait for the inevitable squeal.","Tomb Raider",9640,2.7,-2.3
"9641",3.5,"  Loved The Story But The Movie Was So Fast.","Tomb Raider",9641,2.7,-0.8
"9642",3,"  Can't lie, slightly disappointed with this one. I had higher hopes for a better story line. While Alicia Vikander was solid in the role as Lara Croft... the story felt somewhat flat and uninspired. Still enjoyable... but I had higher hopes.","Tomb Raider",9642,2.7,-0.3
"9643",4,"  I couldn't believe it until I saw it. They actually made a video game movie that's genuinely good. Mortal Kombat is good in that ""cheesy 90s"" way, and other video game movies have been watchable, but none of them were actually great. Tomb Raider may not stray far from the origin story formula and it does suffer from some of the same problems as other movies based on video games, but it more than makes up for it. Alicia Vikander embodies Lara Croft better than Angelina Jolie ever could, and like a female video game version of John Wick, she bucks most of the typical action hero cliches in the process. Instead of always being victorious, she loses fights. When she goes crashing through the jungle, she doesn't have perfect hair upon landing. Rather than being invincible, she gets hurt, and those injuries have lasting effects. What's more, she shows real emotion. When facing extreme danger - whether it's falling hundreds of feet, trying to escape a ship that's breaking apart, or crawling on and through a 70+ year old crashed plane - she shows genuine fear. Most importantly, like Superman in Man of Steel, she actually has a realistic emotional reaction when she is forced to kill someone. Additionally, Dominic West (is it just me or does he look a lot like Hugh Jackman?) does a great job as Richard Croft, and Walton Goggins puts his own spin on a slightly unhinged guy who's willing to kill so he can see his family. Overall, Tomb Raider is genuinely great, and arguably the best video game movie so far.","Tomb Raider",9643,2.7,-1.3
"9644",1,"  This was the worse of the Tomb Raider Movies. After waiting years to see father for years her stupidity caused her fathers life.","Tomb Raider",9644,2.7,1.7

"9648",5,"  Seriously forget about paid movie critics, they're all useless garbage. This movie is great. Great acting, direction, and story. Seriously...burn Rotten Tomatoes to the ground.

"9649",5,"  Amazing!!!! correct archery technique, athletic lead that can actually do stunts, epic choreographed fights that you can actually follow (real MMA technique with few cuts = authentic work). on top of all that you get a story that is killer, liked it way better than the video game one, totally will blow your mind go watch it!!!","Tomb Raider",9649,2.7,-2.3

"9651",3,"  This was the most inconsistently I've ever enjoyed a movie. I think I finally get what every guy feels when they watch a Star Wars or Marvel movie - you're so happy to see the characters you love doing the things they're famous for that you almost forgive its entire lack of a coherent plot. I don't think I'd recommend this movie unless you're a hardcore fan of the franchise. But for me, I have played all the games on PC and systems and I was so happy to finally get a female video game heroine when I was young. As a fan, I was perplexed by how they tried to fit in old tomb raider and the new survivalist tomb raider. I was annoyed that they included the campiness of the old games with the aesthetic of the new. All of the physical aspects of this tomb raider were STELLAR though, and they took painstaking care to make all of the stunts physically possible, but they forgot to make the plot possible. I still fangirled hard in places, and overall I thought it was a good attempt. I want to see Alicia Vikander in more movies, because, despite the awful writing, she kicked ass - way more than Wonder Woman. For what it's worth, I haven't believed in a woman's physicality this much since Terminator 2. The action, stunts, and Alicia Vikander were great, but the writing was ridiculous. I personally would re-edit the film with ONLY Alicia Vikander scenes.","Tomb Raider",9651,2.7,-0.3
"9652",2,"  Probably one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Alicia Vikander's performance. As for the rest: uninspired and nonsensical plot and flat characters, let alone the nonsensical plot twist.","Tomb Raider",9652,2.7,0.7
"9653",5,"  A great popcorn-movie! Not a perfect movie by any means, but Alicia Vikander is charismatic as ever, and carries this movie on her shoulders. Great fun with friends :)","Tomb Raider",9653,2.7,-2.3
"9654",5,"  Really fun treasure hunting outing with the pitfalls, puzzles, traps and a neat legend. Also, we got an actress who is fitting for the Lara role.","Tomb Raider",9654,2.7,-2.3
"9655",0.5,"  Epic fail. Why would you want to watch a movie where there is no bad guy? And no being forced to leave on an island and work for the bad guys, doing what they pay you to do so you can one day go home to your family, doesn't make you the main bad guy, it makes you a goon.","Tomb Raider",9655,2.7,2.2
"9656",5,"  It's much better than the other two I like the new girl she is more serious the best tomb raider movie ever I hope there is another","Tomb Raider",9656,2.7,-2.3
"9657",2.5,"  The plentiful and artistic stunts and special effects could not overcome a story that made no sense whatsoever. Spoiler alert! Try this out... Evil contractor labors 7 yrs in the jungle for evil organization to find the source of a disease that can wipe out humanity. They want it's power. The evil contractor doesn't believe in this power. Doesn't have any resources to harness this virus let alone transport it safely to whatever the evil organization is (shown at the movie's end). It's quite idiotic. As the intrepid and evil explorers trek to the middle of a mountain as their path is constantly destroyed right behind them by countless ridiculously complex booby traps, no one seems concerned about how they will get out once they they find their destination. Don't worry, Lara makes it thru everything with only a forehead scratch and a lot of body smudges.","Tomb Raider",9657,2.7,0.2
"9658",4,"  A very enjoyable movie, not sexualised, not overly cliched and suprisingly good for a movie made after a video game.","Tomb Raider",9658,2.7,-1.3
"9659",4,"  They should have invested some time and effort in the script. It was very linear and predictable. There were no surprises or plot twists. Action scenes were OK. Overall its a decent one time watch.","Tomb Raider",9659,2.7,-1.3
"9660",1.5,"  While the action sequences are satisfactorily thrilling, they are strung together by a boring story and often agonizingly stupid plot.","Tomb Raider",9660,2.7,1.2

"9665",3.5,"  A decent adaptation of the video game just pretty forgettable. Vikander throws herself into the role and makes a good Lara Croft and I?d be interested to see where the franchise can go from here","Tomb Raider",9665,2.7,-0.8
"9666",2,"  Death and taxes are not the only certainties in life, as Benjamin Franklin famously asserted. Another certainty is that video game movies are always bad, but that is not a lesson Hollywood has learned. If anything, they seem to be doubling down on video game movies by giving Tomb Raider yet another shot. The result is by no means the worst video game movie, but it's still a pretty bad one.The inescapable core problem of Tomb Raider is the same as every other video game movie: going from the interactive experience of a game to the passive one of a movie is inherently a step down. Sure, Tomb Raider features the same mechanisms, visual style, and sound effects in its puzzles and death defying stunts as the game. One scene in particular was ripped right out of the game. Watching Lara Croft pulling them off, however, is nowhere near as satisfying as doing them yourself. As is, the action is pedestrian, but compared to the game's combat, it's downright boring. That the movie intrigues me more with the fast-paced lives of London couriers than the actual tomb raiding is an early bad sign.If it's unfair to judge this film by video game standards, then allow me to inform you this movie isn't that much better from a pure film-making perspective, either. The lighting alone is atrocious, especially during night scenes. They are so poorly illuminated that they strained my eyes. Worst of all is the thunderstorm scene. The filmmakers' idea of simulating lightning is to rapidly flicker the lights on and off. This extremely uncomfortable technique drags on for so long, there should be a warning in case it triggers an epileptic seizure. At least the movie's unconventional camerawork manages to impress. Each shot rarely gets followed up by the logical next camera angle, while the 180 degree rule shrinks to more like the 120 degree rule. For a style that plays fast and loose with the rules of cinematography, it is quite a feat that the action remains visually coherent.Granted, video games are about much more than game-play, and this movie, based off of the 2013 reboot, has a story to tell. If Tomb Raider was an earnest attempt at adapting that story for a wider audience, it would probably be a much better movie. Instead, it ends up another attempt to kick-start a sequel, so the most interesting elements of the 2013 Tomb Raider's story are replaced with franchise tropes. The entire supporting cast is swapped for a pair of less interesting characters. To the movie's credit, each character is well-acted enough to distract from how two-dimensional they are. Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) definitely looks the part for Lara Croft, and she brings the tough, quick-witted attitude Croft is known for, but her Croft lacks the character arc that made the game's story so good. She begins the movie close to mastering her talents, getting all but the bare minimum character development out of the way. It's hysterical that one of her nameless friends what appears to be a Mass Effect jacket, because the writers reduced an interesting journey of a sheltered college student thrust into becoming a hardened survivalist into Daddy Issues: The Movie. The main plot begins with a pair of cliches that only get compounded. While this movie commendably portrays what kind of punishment the human body can take better than most of its peers, it only does so to a certain extent. A named character can take a gunshot to the back of the shoulder, but the exact same injury kills an extra instantly. The game's twisted villains are now part of a generic shadow organization. Tomb Raider is such a transparent reenactment of Indiana Jones, that the main villain is even named Vogel, just like the Nazi in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Moviegoers who never played the game might not notice a lot of this movie's flaws, but if you want to experience Tomb Raider in the best way possible, the game is still the superior version in every regard. It has more content than this 2-hour film. Its interactive nature makes the action more enjoyable. Visually, the game is far more stunning, especially the remastered version. The story, by Rhianna Pratchett, whose father was the late great author Terry Pratchett, is quite well-written, too. Plus, the game has been out so long, you could easily buy it for the same price or cheaper than a movie ticket, and get so much more bang for your buck.","Tomb Raider",9666,2.7,0.7
"9667",4.5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's easy for the critics to come down hard on the story, but the writers were simply modifying the storyline from the game to fit a film. Overall I think they did well. Alicia Vikander does an excellent job playing a much more believable Laura Croft, and despite my original with a Swede playing a Brit, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role now.","Tomb Raider",9667,2.7,-1.8
"9668",4.5,"  This movie is the adaptation of the video game Tomb Raider (2013) which itself is a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. And so the movie takes you on Lara Croft's first adventure: to find her missing father and to solve the mystery of the Death Queen Himiko. This movie stands well on its own as a solid action thriller. There are several fight sequences throughout the movie, all of which feel very kinetic and very physical. Alicia Vikander's commitment to the role shows really well. The element of mystery regarding Queen Himiko is also handled quite well. But the movie also has its share of flaws, such as a weak villain and a general lack of emotional investment. This could be attributed to the quick pacing of the film, which covers a lot of ground in terms of Lara Croft's development as a character. Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch for its action sequences and Alicia Vikander's performance as Lara Croft.","Tomb Raider",9668,2.7,-1.8

"9672",5,"  Saw this movie at the European premiere, I've never been interested in video game movies because they usually sucks. I am a big Tomb Raider fan and didn't like the two Angie movies but this one is a huge step up! The actress is incredibly talented, same as the supporting cast. The director did an amazing job! The story is pretty good, I espec loved the london parts cause the scenes are really intense in term of character building. The island scenes are really good too but I really really loved the third act in the tomb!!! I really recommend this movie to fans, people who didn't like the trailers (They showed the wrong tone of the movie), and people who've never Played the game too!","Tomb Raider",9672,2.7,-2.3
"9673",2,"  I should preface this review by stating that I am not a gamer. I've never played the ""Tomb Raider"" video games, but like many, I'm familiar with the character of Lara Croft given the two previous movies. The video game got a reboot in 2013, which apparently means that a movie reboot was the natural next step. This iteration finds Academy Award winner Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) as Croft. We learn that at a young age, her father (West) left his family to go in search of a hidden ancient tomb belonging to the Japanese Queen Himiko. It's been years since her father has been seen and is now presumed dead. Lara is strapped for cash, yet is leery about signing over the death papers, which would in turn give her his inheritance. She ultimately decides to sign the Declaration in Death papers and as part of the process is given an ancient artifact leading to a hidden basement of clues, texts, papers, and notes her father left behind. Her father's dying wish was to have his files on the Himiko case destroyed. She's too intrigued by what she finds, and disobeys his orders. Her inquisitive nature leads her to Hong Kong to finish her father's work. Lara learns the hard way that he wasn't the only one looking into Himiko's tomb when she's taken hostage by the Trinity group led by Mathias Vogel (Goggins).If the premise seems a bit generic, that's because Tomb Raider has that general quality about it. This isn't the Lara Croft type of movie we're used to as this iteration decides to tell the origins story of the character. Do we really need this? I'm so exhausted by origin stories. The new DC Extended Universe made the same poor choice with the Ben Affleck Batman. I think we could have rebooted the Lara Croft franchise and gone the James Bond approach by just casting a new actress and given her a fresh mission to go on while incorporating the father angle.The casting of Alicia Vikander is a daring choice as she doesn't quite fit the design we're used to seeing of the character from the games. I want to be clear though that it's not a bad thing despite the image people may have of her in their heads. Angelina Jolie originally played her and has the stature and masculinity typically associated with the character. We see Vikander's Croft trying to find her strength throughout this film. She's not quite the fighter we've come to expect. Vikander brings a softer edge to the character, which fits the origins/pre ""Lara Croft"" side of the character. She's a strong enough actress to carry this version of the character representing the everyday woman who, in this case, has distanced herself from her family's past but is now forced to confront her legacy. Vikander can also pull off the intelligence of the character as we find out her father's knack for solving clues and riddles has been passed down to her.A big film like this should be an action juggernaut. The first initial sequence follows Croft in a ""Capture the Flag"" style bike race through the narrow streets of London. It's a pretty slick chase that's one of the more exciting moments in the movie. Croft is a speedy character whether it's by bike or by foot. Too much of the rest of the action relies heavily on CG effects, poor CG effects to be exact. It begs me to wonder if the film's budget wasn't high enough to pull off what was asked for or if the stunts and tricks are too elaborate in the first place. I had the same conundrum while watching A Wrinkle in Time. It feels more aligned with The Mummy than say Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's missing the fun and humor that came with Indiana Jones. I get that they're different characters, but I want to feel the exciting thrill factor. Tomb Raider takes itself too seriously and isn't deep enough to find the mystery or urgency present.This is the biggest film to date for Norwegian director Roar Uthaug. I can't tell if the movie is attempting too much or too little. Is there too much going on with trying to reboot a franchise with an origins story and a new actress? Everyone involved is trying to make an exciting action film to be respected by the gamers who have invested countless hours with the character. At the same time, there's too little going on as the story and the characters are lacking any sort of creativity. I'm not a gamer, and I barely know Lara Croft from any other game, but even I don't feel a need for an origins story. Tomb Raider has a few good things going for it mainly with the leads. Alicia Vikander has the potential to make for a whip-smart Lara Croft. Walton Goggins, who was excellent in The Hateful Eight, is always reliable as the bad guy. He's sleazy and vial and just what is needed for this kind of movie. The ending leaves the impression the studio wants to create a new franchise as Lara realizes there are more secrets and skeletons in her father's closet. We start seeing that shift from innocent Lara to vengeful Lara. I'd be curious as to what Vikander will do with the character, but I wouldn't be saddened if a sequel didn't happen.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies?

It's not progress. This is not the path for a good actress to take. The film is one miserable cliche after another with overblown effects and tired action.

"9680",3.5,"  I think Alicia Vikander is the best Lara Croft yet. I never really liked the old Lara Croft games (90's) PS1 or Angelina Jolie movies. The new Tomb Raider games and this new version of Lara is far better IMO than any previous iterations.This movie is based on the Tomb Raider game reboot (2013) that takes place on Devils Island. Great story and Alicia Vikander is great in the role. I gave it a high review. I have been a fan of Alicia Vikander since her role in Ex-Machina, she does a fantastic job in this roleI enjoyed her character developoment through the movie, she goes from being a Daddy's little girl, challenging him when he falls short. The rest of the characters including the villain seemed one dimensionalthey could use some improvement for the sequel. I will definitely support this franchise in the future.

"9687",3,"  March 16, 2017Anyone going into ""Tomb Raider"" (2018) will (hopefully) not be expecting cutting edge cinema. It is, after all, just another fantastical adventure story along the same lines as the ""Indian Jones"" movies, ""The Goonies,"" and, well, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider."" Yes, this is a re-imagining, if you will (it's not exactly a remake), of that Angelina Jolie vehicle from 2001, which was the first filmed incarnation of the popular video game franchise. And just like Indiana Jones, the heroine in this series is a resourceful archaeologist, although at the beginning of this movie she doesn't officially have that title. Even so, she embarks on a quest around the globe to find a supernatural historical figure, while simultaneously using her wits, unique athletic abilities, and trusted bow and arrow to battle and thwart evil men.Because ""Tomb Raider"" hardly brings anything new-neither concept, character nor narrative-wise-to the action-adventure table, its success depends heavily on the likability and enthusiasm of its star and whether we can get behind her in spite of a lackluster plot and mostly traditional action sequences. Luckily, Alicia Vikander is not only physically capable as Lara, but her sympathetic expressions and genuine emotions bring an unexpected depth and vulnerability to the role. She's not just a pretty face and so we end up getting more out of ""Tomb Raider"" than we initially anticipated.I used lackluster to describe the plot, and it is, but that's not to say it's bad, just ordinary. It simply serves, like most plots in movies of this nature, as a clothesline on which to hang over-the-top action sequences, such as a road bike race along the streets of London; a foot chase across parked boats in a fishing harbor; a giant sea storm; a downhill mountain pursuit that ends with Lara falling in a river and hanging onto a crashed plane that sits on the edge of a waterfall; mighty leaps across pits; jumps and slides on stone floors to avoid booby-traps; and of course, more than one instance in which Lara gets to show off her mixed martial arts skills, including a direct hit to the villain's family jewels.Essentially, the action sequences are the plot, since they take up most of the screen time. The other minutes are filled with a basic back story and introduction to Lara, a carefree twentysomething and borderline ne'er-do-well who, despite being the heiress to her father's massive fortune and the Croft family manor, often lives hand-to-mouth as a courier. When she's not delivering packages, she's either kickboxing or living recklessly one way or another. Following her latest run-in with the law, Ana (Kristen Scott Thomas), the overseer of her father's estate, tells Lara she has to finally accept that her father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), is dead, and if she doesn't claim her inheritance, she runs the risk of losing it all. But Lara isn't convinced her father is really gone. Years ago, Richard, an ""official"" archaeologist and seeker of truth, embarked on a mission to find the lost tomb of Himiko, an ancient Japanese queen who ruled with black magic and had the power to inflict death with just a touch of her hand. Later on we learn exactly why Richard sought Himiko's sarcophagus (it's not a huge twist, but I'll refrain from spoiling it), and once Lara uncovers specific instructions from him within a Japanese puzzle, she starts her own search for Himiko, hoping that maybe she'll also find her father. Lara's journey starts in Hong Kong, where she partners with Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), son of her father's travel companion who also went missing. They eventually make it to Yamatai, the island Himiko once ruled, and here they face the merciless Mathias Vogel (Walter Goggins), who claims to have killed Richard in order to exploit his research. Without giving too much away, although it doesn't really take a genius to figure out how ""Tomb Raider"" will play out, Lara must escape Vogel's clutches and prevent him and his cronies from obtaining Himiko's power and using it for evil. If the plot sounds familiar, it should, because it's essentially the plot of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which created the template for other movies in this genre, including ""The Mummy"" and ""National Treasure."" Ideally, the makers of ""Tomb Raider"" would have sought a more original story to place Lara in, but nevertheless, we go along with it. Besides, the real reason to see ""Tomb Raider"" is because Vikander is so charming and passionate. We root for and ultimately care about Lara because of her, and what's refreshing is the way the screenplay paints her not as a superhero type, but as someone who's vulnerable and still has a lot of growing up to do. Vikander herself is not yet 30 and, as Lara, she comes across as a kid, still shaping herself into the warrior we know she'll become (which is where Jolie's version started off). For now, though, she gets hurt, makes her share of stupid mistakes, and has a hard time accepting she doesn't know everything. If there's a sequel, I believe Vikander could make Lara's growth and development rather interesting, and it'd be wise for the next movie to focus on this instead of another hackneyed plot.As a re-introduction to Lara Croft, ""Tomb Raider"" functions well as mindless, Saturday-matinee entertainment. Fans of the genre will be satiated by the action scenes, which are energetic and tactile, not coming across as too CGI-laden. But what ultimately keeps the movie together is Vikander, whose spirit and emotion convince us to buy what the filmmakers are selling. She takes command and we sense she could really take this series beyond where the genre has already explored, which would be fitting, since by the end of this movie, you could say her character is now an ""official"" explorer.*NOTE: The final scene, I feel, is a misstep. Without giving anything away, it takes place at a pawn shop and involves guns. In light of recent tragedies and public outcry regarding the accessibility of firearms, it would be interesting to see, if there ever is a ""Tomb Raider"" sequel, if Lara's character would be just as gung-ho about guns. While I don't encourage any weapons of any kind against people, if Lara must have one, she should stick with her bow and arrow.","Tomb Raider",9687,2.7,-0.3

"9689",2.5,"  mostly fun as mindless entertainment. cool adventure feel. also some dumb stuff and things to make fun of. and not very well made overall. lots of shaky-cam, and some mediocre CGI.SPOILERSafter the story was done, they added this ridiculous part to set up a sequel that was really dumb. the step mom was the leader of the organization trying to get the virus??? not only that, but they do the reveal while replaying certain things that were said earlier in the movie, which is pretty normal, but one of the things they repeated was said about 2 minutes earlier, no exaggeration. she told her step mom you can deal with the day to day stuff, and then she realized it as her mom walked away, and it repeated that same line as if we forgot about it","Tomb Raider",9689,2.7,0.2

"9691",4,"  A movie with a certain amount heart, where the audience can empathize with a likable Lara Croft (Vikander). Something the Jolie films failed to allow us to do. Sure you cannot analyze it, (video game Movie), and sure they could have gone further with the jungle (Jane Rambo) sequences and (the Indiana Jones ) Tombs, but it did suceed in becoming what it probably set put for... bring a very good video game movie.","Tomb Raider",9691,2.7,-1.3
"9692",2,"  This movie is a piece of garbage. I was completely unimpressed by the story or lack there of. None of the actors know how to act. It takes about half the movie to even start the story. Half the characters are completely and utterly pointless. There is one scene where the super evil guy shoots someone for just being sick. I presume that this was to show the brutality of the character, but all is it does is make it more ridiculous that he doesn't kill Lu Ren when he tries to kill like all the guards with a shovel. Anyway this movie is terrible. Do not watch it. Spend your two hours that you would be watching this movie, helping the homeless.","Tomb Raider",9692,2.7,0.7

"9700",5,"  Being a Tomb Raider gamer my opinion?????out of 5. A Great Tomb Raider Origins movie. Captures the heart & theme of Tomb Raider. Game play moves, story, exploring, action & puzzles.One critic was scathing saying nothing new and that Alicia Vikander was a stoic & exasperated character. Well my friend Tomb Raider is survival. Maneuvering through varied treacherous terrain, life threatening obstacles and challenges -- no fun time ride.Alicia Vikander gave a GREAT performance. Bringing us deeper into the depths of Tomb Raiding with sweat, dirt, scrapes, bruises & wounds -- with a realistic appropriate stoic, exasperated feel to her character -- surviving.Shall we say ""shaken but not deterred""","Tomb Raider",9700,2.7,-2.3
"9701",1.5,"  Es como ver una versión adolescente de ""Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)"".

"9709",2,"  Had a lot of promise, but it ended up being a worse version of ""Raider of the Lost Ark"". The plot tries to do too much; e.g. we are barely introduced to one important character before he get captured and put in a chain gang (and from then on really doesn't affect the story in any meaningful way). The back-to-back ""cliffhanger"" scenes also get tiring; it even seems that Lara's character acknowledges this when she says, ""Really?!"" after one particularly egregious example of having to escape a cliffhanger sequence 3 times in a row. Oh, the film briefly turns into a (completely unnecessary) zombie flick as well.","Tomb Raider",9709,2.7,0.7
"9710",5,"  Greatly enjoyed.Hollywood has been working for years to try and turn successful video games into successful movies. While they have been met with limited success, these studios have yet to really make a movie that has won over audiences on a broad scale. The most recent effort, Tomb Raider, was not the first great video game movie that so many of us have been waiting for, but it was the closest that we have come so far, and it was clearly a step in the right direction. It certainly qualifies as the best movie based on a game so far. Tomb Raider wasn't perfect, but it was good. That by itself puts the movie above nearly all its competition. There are several things that Tomb Raider did right in making the transition from the video game to the theatrical release. Here are a few of them. If there's one thing that most of the reviews have agreed on, even those that didn't love the film, it's that whatever faults Tomb Raider has, Alicia Vikander is not one of them. The actress puts forth a strong performance as the new Lara Croft and is able to make her a believable action hero while also making her a relatable character.","Tomb Raider",9710,2.7,-2.3
"9711",4.5,"  I WaS SO PLEASANTLY SHOCKED AT HOW AMAZING THIS MOVIE IS. iT WAS CLEAR FROM THE TRAILERS THAT THEY WERE HEADING IN A BETTER DIRECTION FOR THE TOMB RAIDER SERIES THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST WITH NONE OTHER THAN ANGELINA JOLIE. Alicia Vikander TRULY SOARS IN THIS PERFORMANCE AND HAS CREATED A BELIEVABLE, VULNERABLE CHARACTER. THE PLOT IS GOOD, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TOP-NOTCH, THE CINETOGRAPHY AND DIRECTING IS SPOT ON.gO SEE THIS MOVING IN THE BEST THEATER YOU CAN FINE (AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY) AND GRAB THAT POPCORN. IT'S ABOUT TO BE A WILD RIDE!","Tomb Raider",9711,2.7,-1.8
"9712",2.5,"  Should've cut the first 20 minutes, just start on the boat. Poor story decisions lead to a main protagonist that can't do anything on their own for most of the movie. Iconic moments from the source material are weak and wasted in this adaptation.","Tomb Raider",9712,2.7,0.2

"9715",3,"  While it won't push the video game genre to greater heights, Tomb Raider is one of the better movies of the genre and Alicia Vikander makes the role her own.","Tomb Raider",9715,2.7,-0.3
"9716",5,"  Surprisingly decent, especially for a video game movie. Lara set out on her first expedition finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai.The storyline based upon the 2013 reboot of LC, was lauded for revitalizing one of gaming's biggest names and most venerable franchises, and it did it in part by leaning into the narrative side of the medium, with greater depth and characterization for its lead and a clear and compelling story it wanted to tell with her. It surprisingly plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of ""Cliffhanger,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans. Alicia Vikander did a great job here. She's correctly cast as a woman who's literally to-the-manor-born. More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence. Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral performance, letting out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or gets slammed on the ground by a brawny foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace","Tomb Raider",9716,2.7,-2.3
"9717",2,"  Another victim of the ""Video Game Movie"" curse. I knew this was gonna be a terrible reboot as soon as I saw the trailer but boy, was I in for a treat.First of all, it boggles my mind as onto how this movie got financed with 94 Million Dollars and got handed to people with barely any experience. Thankfully it's flopping at the box office so we won't see a sequel but whoever is using this project as means of money laundering still got their cash back. Tomb Raider made a pathetic 28Mil domestic and a total of 133Mil worldwide as of this moment.Now let's move onto the movie itself. The writers and creators of this project had dozens of ""Tomb Raider"" games to seek inspiration from as well as millions of myths and legends from all around the globe, they picked the weakest concept to be converted into a movie. They chose the 2013 Tomb Raider relaunch of the game series, which focuses on a young Lara Croft going out into the world for the first time and becoming the legend that she is. NOBODY want's to see this as a movie, (I'm assuming) most of us who saw the movie are familiar with the game lore to at least a minimal extent. The developers of the game had to start fresh and make a new Lara without outrage, this movie didn't have to worry about that. Audiences wanted two hours of an epic action-adventure set in exotic locales, following the story of the most badass female hero in the world. Instead, we got to sit through an excruciating and cringy two-hour drama about a whiny, entitled, dumb ""teenager"" who is repeatedly humiliated at every single task that she attempts on her quest to find and save her daddy. It's not ""relatable"", it's just bad and sad. Personally, the casting of Alicia Vikander was the first disappointment while the movie was still in production. Why not use Camilla Luddington who the new Lara Croft is based on, played by and voiced by? Why go for a C-List actress in hopes of a higher box-office? Those choices are beyond me. Alicia's Lara reminds me of Kristen Stewart's performance of Bella in the ""Twilight"" series - lifeless, bland and annoying. Perhaps, it's just the horrendous writing and she's a good actress, I honestly can't tell, however I know for a fact there is lots of wasted potential in this movie. Take Walton Goggins for example, fantastic performance in The Hateful Eight, sub-par performance in Tomb Raider, however, I don't think the script gave the actors much to work with, no room to act or express themselves/their characters in this adaptation.Literally, everything about the writing in this movie is depressingly bad, characters often speak their motivations, emotions and plot exposition through the blandest, most boring, unnatural dialogue you can possibly imagine. This movie feels like it was written by somebody who's never written a movie before. Oh wait, Geneva Robertson-Dworet who wrote this movie has never worked on a single other movie before. Shocking, I know! You know what's more shocking? She's set to write Marvel's first female-led superhero film ""Captain Marvel"", as well as ""Sherlock Holmes 3"" and the upcoming live-action adaptation of ""Dungeons & Dragons"". I pray to the studio executives and the ""big mouse"" that they take those movies away from her because they will be a train-wreck otherwise. The other contributing writer of this movie, Alastair Siddons is almost equally inexperienced with 1 movie behind their belt (which sits at a 27% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes).If you've ever though some movie checks off every single cliche and trope of its genre, whatever movie you have in mind has a new competitor. Tomb Raider is one of the most painfully predictable movies to a point of hilarity. Literally, I was laughing my entire way through this film because it follows it's own formula beat by beat leaving nothing behind. I would honestly say it's as bad but also equally entertaining as ""Suicide Squad"". To be fair, I would assume that most average moviegoers who are programmed to enjoy their mindless entertainment made by a formula won't even notice anything off and shrug it off as a ""decent"" movie. However, if you have any amount self-respect and prior knowledge of films, I think it's safe to say this will be a great new addition to your ""so bad it's good"" collection of movies.Moving on from that, the action is honestly as boring and predictable as the writing, with some of the best scenes being lifted directly, frame-by-frame from the 2013 video-game. The fighting choreography is equally ""meh"". The cinematography is also not this movies strong suit, nor are the special effects or acting or production design or anything really. In fact, the movie consists of maybe about 15 minutes of tomb raiding, meaning if you cut this movie down by about an hour and a half, it would make a perfect short film. Also, most importantly, even though nobody wants to see an origin story, that being the crucial part of this movie and it's plot, I'm afraid to say it fails on that promise and there is absolutely no character development at all. Maybe with the exception of cheesy lines such as ""You messed with the wrong Croft"" and ""I guess I'm not that kind of Croft"" and Croft this and Croft that and ""I'll take two guns please"". Get it? It's a reference for nerds like you! This movie beats it's gaming audience in the head with pointless Easter eggs and makes sure to point them out and scream about it as if we're all dumb babies.My conclusion is that even ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was significantly better and had its moments unlike the 2018 adaptation of ""Tomb Raider"". So, if you like learning from ""bad Hollywood"" or just want to have mindless fun or maybe need to fall asleep on a flight, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise, be it the games or the movie franchise starring Angelina Jolie, you'll be severely disappointed. If you're a fan of the action-adventure genre and want a thrilling escape from reality, desperately trying to scratch that itch, wanting to feel the way you did when you watched movies like ""Indiana Jones"", ""The Mummy"" (original trilogy), ""National Treasure"" or even ""Sahara"" then once again, prepare for disappointment.","Tomb Raider",9717,2.7,0.7
"9718",4,"  Tomb Raider was pretty good. Alicia Vikander is awesome. She does a great job playing a younger more innocent version. Then at the end she becomes the Angelina Jolie version.. She was great in Ex Machina too. What an actress.","Tomb Raider",9718,2.7,-1.3
"9719",3.5,"  Just saw it and it's not bad at all. It's an action film so don't expect too much character development. If you want that then go an watch an oscar bait film. This movie serves it's purpose of being two hours of good fun to just sit back, eat ypur popcorn, drink your soft drink and chill without having to over think anything. It's one of the better video game adaptions so don't worry about what these critics say and watch it for yourself.","Tomb Raider",9719,2.7,-0.8

"9722",3,"  For an adventure movie, it is above average. For a video game movie, it is the greatest ever made. I had a good time with this movie. It also gives me hope for future video game adaptations.","Tomb Raider",9722,2.7,-0.3
"9723",3.5,"  Call me crazy but I actually really enjoyed this movie. No doubt, there were some parts of the dialogue that I found lacking but that blame falls on the script righter, not the actors. I also felt like Daniel Wu's character was really under used. However, the places where the movie did excel where with the action scenes. Even to a mundane bike chase scene was portrayed as an exciting action sequence. The sound producers also did an excellent job illustrating the spooky atmosphere of the Tomb of Himiko, with a horror moviesque jump scares. Overall, I think this movie does a good job adapting the 2013 video game. Unlike many other critics, I like the more serious attitude that this movie and the newer games take on Lara Croft's character. But it appears that many horny men can't find interest in a movie with a female lead unless she is overly sexualized and makes jokes.","Tomb Raider",9723,2.7,-0.8
"9724",5,"  I have been a huge Tomb Raider fan since I was very young. I remember my dad buying the games for me and taking me to see the movies with Angelina Jolie as Lara. I loved those movies, and thought they could never be top them. This movie is a great representation of the new Tomb Raider games. I think the moive was entertaining to watch but this might be just because I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan. But the movie was beautiful and I felt that the acting was on par with great actors such as Alicia Vikander playing as Lara Croft. I will admit there are flaws in the movie, some of which that will need to be improve if there is to be a sequel but overall I was impressed with what they did with this movie adaptation of my beloved favorite video game.","Tomb Raider",9724,2.7,-2.3
"9725",2,"  Entertaining in parts, but this script needed a lot of work. The story makes no sense at all. I can suspend belief, but don't spend so much time on exposition when what you are saying makes no sense. Only surprises are when something that would make sense doesn't happen.","Tomb Raider",9725,2.7,0.7
"9726",5,"  As a major fan of the games since the first game, i was very worried I would hate this film, but I really enjoyed it. I think they did an excellent job with the pacing of this film. The story to action ratio is very reminiscent of a lot of the games in the franchise. The character doesn't feel quite like the Lara Croft we were expecting to see, but that's because she isn't... Yet. This story aims to show how an ambitious, grounded, and adventurous girl becomes the badass, skilled, and experienced Tomb Raider we know and love. Optimistic for the next film.","Tomb Raider",9726,2.7,-2.3
"9727",5,"  As a love time fan of the video game and of Alicia Vikander I have to say this film is amazing! It captures the true essence of the game and it's characters. While I would have liked more to see Lara battle with the main antagonist that doesn't hurt the film. The acting was spot on especially between Lara and her father. Great Tomb Raider moments and Alicia Vikander is a solid Lara Croft! I hope this movie gets a sequel. Not perfect but definitely a solid film and worth the watch.","Tomb Raider",9727,2.7,-2.3
"9728",4,"  Just finished watching this last night with my student apartment neighbour... and my 2nd time at IMAX!!

"9729",4.5,"  It's no surprise that this movie shines in the action department, but I was pleased to see that there were likable characters attached with just enough interaction and development to ground the whole movie. I enjoy Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, as she's a very good representation of the original VG character - Alicia Vikander very much embodies the new Lara that was rebooted by Crystal Dynamics is the 2013 game.Overall this focuses more on becoming the Tomb Raider, coming to terms with her family's power, her place in it, and finding her own agency- all of which will help to add to Lara's depth if the franchise continues.","Tomb Raider",9729,2.7,-1.8
"9730",3.5,"  I just saw this movie today and it was great. But the reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it seemed like a rip off of Indiana Jones and Rouge One A Star Wars Story","Tomb Raider",9730,2.7,-0.8
"9731",4,"  I enjoyed this movie from the beginning to end. Based on the Survivor series, this movie had some pretty brutal moments, and a okay story. Alicia Vikander did a great job playing Lara Croft, but the main villain Mathias Vogel felt like any other cookie-cutter villain. I did enjoy this movie, but it could've been better.","Tomb Raider",9731,2.7,-1.3

The pull on her bow is so weak the arrows it shoots would probably just bounce off somebody's forehead.More please.","Tomb Raider",9735,2.7,-1.3
"9736",4.5,"  I really enjoyed this film. I've played the most recent video games and it did have a similar feel to it. Of course the games are better, but it was still nice to watch. Alicia Vikander Really made it. What an amazing actress!","Tomb Raider",9736,2.7,-1.8
"9737",2,"  The movie is not bringing anything new, the story we saw 100 of times in other movies and it is all cliche at this pointWe didnt get the feeling of Lara Croft that excel in physical but felt more it was luck she survived this situation I wasnt able to feel the characters outside of Daniel Wu eveyone acting was mediocre at mostThe shots of movies werent that great starting with the first scene and the fight scene where the director used every single shot he got from all angles, not just it hurt my eyes jumping between all these cuts but it didnt look good at all, im sad that directors are still using this technique to force the audience to feel the actionI didnt get my self to finish the movie and I left the moment she found her father, i was like im done bad scenes, bad shots and bad storyI will give 1 star because I realy like Daniel Wu doing a drunk man scene, that was a great performance","Tomb Raider",9737,2.7,0.7

"9739",5,"  I love the game and love this movie","Tomb Raider",9739,2.7,-2.3
"9740",4,"  A ridiculous movie, but one that fits incredibly well into the universe of Tomb Raider. It keeps very well with the tone of the games while making a story that works well for the big screen.","Tomb Raider",9740,2.7,-1.3
"9741",4.5,"  Solid action movie and Alicia Vikkander is a delight as Lara Croft. A pretty faithful film adaption of the 2013 game with enough that's different to not make it a copy and paste job.","Tomb Raider",9741,2.7,-1.8
"9742",3,"  If you leave your expectations at the door, 'Tomb Raider' w/ Alicia Vikander is a decent movie. If you're expecting Oscar worthy performances or award winning dialog, shame on you. Tomb Raider is about action-adventure and nothing else. There are no super-human powers. No alien space tech from across the universe. No inter-galactic world crushing bad guy. What you do get is Lara Croft chasing her father's ghost half way around the world to a remote island in an attempt to stop people from unearthing the goddess of death. Yes, this movie is flawed but there is enough action to hold your attention for two hours. If you're good with that, great, just remember to leave your expectations at the door. It may not be worth full price, but it is worth your time.","Tomb Raider",9742,2.7,-0.3

Even though it was long, I didn't feel bored or like it was dragging- the time went by quickly, and I wish there were more Alicia Vikander Tomb Raider movies to watch. It was a perfect mix of action, emotion, and Alicia Vikander was the perfect Lara Croft. I also loved Daniel Wu's character. Overall, I thought it was the perfect movie to escape for a little while, and I hope they make more!","Tomb Raider",9747,2.7,-2.3
"9748",4,"  Very much a new Indiana Jones and, in that genre, perfectly watchable.

"9775",2,"  Quick review of Tomb Raider: A mishmash of action cliches and cheap jump scares that do not do the franchise any justice. Try to remember the cliches found in 2012 (2009 with John Cusack) where the protagonist was on the verge of collapse, only to be saved by deus ex machina. Have that image in your mind? Now rinse and repeat for virtually every action sequence in the 2 hour time span and you've summarized the ""action"" portion of this film. Alicia Vikander was wonderful in Deus Ex Machina (2015) and entertaining in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015); however, her role fell short here. I felt that the role of Lara Croft will be attempted by many female actresses and much like the role of James Bond, each individual should add a unique twist on that role - a signature, if you will. Such a signature would separate that actor's contributions from past iterations. Unfortunately, Vikander added little to separate her from Angelina Jolie's sultry and seductive take on a then-sexualized role. Granted, it could be argued that the role wasn't designed for a lot of emotional development, but Jolie still brought a sense of emotional attachment to her father in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). This degree of depth and even the dilemma, upon further reflection, was copied in all-to-similar fashion in this rendition. Dominic West performed well and it is a shame his personal demons were not given more screen time. This leaves us with a conclusion: this movie, as a reboot, works as a copy to the original. If you want a more humanized Lara Croft in a predictable screenplay, this may work for you. If you are looking for something new, look else. 2 Jumping Mummies out of 5.","Tomb Raider",9775,2.7,0.7
"9776",4,"  i enjoyed the character building aspect. then the 2nd and 3d act were filled with great action. The movie provided some heartfelt moments and some well placed levity. Finally, the musical score was amazing. Junkie XL really killed it.","Tomb Raider",9776,2.7,-1.3

"9779",0.5,"  We left 1 hour into the movie. This wil be on the all time worst five list, forever. The script is poorly written. The lead is too young and too simple a character. A spoiled tempermental brat, that doesn't have enough intelligence to to be a heroin or to even travel alone to a remote area of the world. The long, drawn out drama scenes make up 85 percent of the movie. I will stay clear of this director and actress in the future. The dentist would have been more enjoyable.

"9792",3.5,"  Lara Croft was best known for her exaggerated physical assets (rendered as Madonna-worthy pointed polygons) and short shorts than as any sort of character. She was realized on the big screen in 2001's Tomb Raider as an elite physical specimen portrayed by Angelina Jolie, where the filmmakers went the added step of padding Jolie's bosom to better reflect the source material's image. The filmmakers literally thought this aspect would be make-or-break with fans, as if Jolie herself was not naturally vivacious enough. As you can imagine, Lara Croft was primarily seen as a sexy avatar, whether on the small screen or the big screen. This new Tomb Raider aims to better ground its story, tone, and central heroine, and it mostly succeeds. This is a solid, pleasantly enjoyable mid-tier action movie that might also qualify as the best video-game-to-film adaptation so far (sorry Uwe Boll).Lara (Alicia Vikander) is struggling in the wake of her father's (Dominic West) disappearance. It's been years but she holds onto hope that dear old dad is still out there. One day, she discovers her father's secret study and a video message he recorded confessing why he left. He's seeking a fabled tomb on a hidden island off the coast of Japan, a tomb devoted to a powerful goddess of myth who sacrificed her admirers. Also looking for the tomb is Vogel (Walton Goggins) and a team of armed mercenaries. Lara must stay ahead of the mercenaries, find her father and the long-lost hidden tomb.This is a Lara Croft stripped down and absent the male gaze, which has defined her travails just as much as the treasure hunting adventures. There's not a single shot in the movie that seeks to ogle Vikander's lean body. Even her outfit, as mentioned a staple of Croft's early appeal, is a modest take top and khakis. The emphasis this time is on what she endures and overcomes rather than the curvature of her body. This is an attempt at an origin tale, rebooting Lara for a new generation of fans. She's less the cool buxom sexpot with the twin pistols than a struggling young woman facing her fears. This is the first time Lara Croft has been envisioned as a character. There's a level of broader realism that the movie holds onto, positioning this Croft as less the gun blazing super cool badass and more as a stealthy, plucky, and scrappy figure of moderate action. There are moments where she hides and moments where she runs, as they are the best recourse. She's not imposing in her build and poise like a Gina Carano (Haywire) but Vikander's got some serious moves. With all that in mind, let's not get too carried away here. Lara Croft may have some extra dimensions but she's not exactly a fully formed, three-dimensional character or boasting the kind of magnetic personality that drew us to Indiana Jones or even a Nathan Drake. She's capable but also limited in interest and charisma.The action is invigorating enough and given a clear scope of play. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug (The Wave) orchestrates the action in clean long shots and precise edits, allowing the audience a clear sense of what is happening. A frantic bicycle chase and foot chase in the first act are given extra vitality by a roaming camera that takes in the full view. There's enough variety in the action and natural consequences to keep things interesting. This is a movie that doesn't feel overpowered with CGI, even though I know it's present. Uthaug makes a point of emphasizing practical effects and sets, which adds a further level of realism to the excitement. I'd call it a more pared down, realistic version of an action adventure but it still has outlandish set pieces like Lara finding refuge atop a crumbling WWII era bomber that just so happens to be wedged atop a rock face overlooking a steep waterfall. Even during these moments, and the last act takes place almost entirely within the ancient tomb and its traps, the movie keeps things relatively credible. It's fun without being too flippant and serious enough without losing its sense of amusement. Tomb Raider reminded me a lot of a big-screen version of an Uncharted game, a rollicking adventure that also feels rooted in our own world, but with a hint of the supernatural creeping along the edges. The conclusion has a few nice surprises following this pattern even with the possibility of actual zombies emerging.Vianker (The Danish Girl) acquits herself nicely in the realm of action-adventure. She gained twelve pounds of muscle and has a pretty impressive six-pack. Vikander is a smaller actress by nature but the filmmakers do a fine job of placing her in believable action scenarios that rely upon her athleticism. Her Lara is a stubbornly independent protagonist who refuses to give up, which makes her a winning force even when her personality fails to sufficiently light up the screen. Vikander hurls herself into the role, performing an impressive array of stunts, and yelping along to the genre demands.There are some plot holes that are hard to ignore, mostly pertaining to motivations. In the first act, we learn tat Lara is heir to a vast fortune of money and a big company that owns many other subsidiaries. However, she refuses to essentially inherit the company because it means having to sign papers declaring her missing father as deceased. I understand the character's rejection of wanting to accept her father's death, but when taken to this extent it becomes almost comical. Lara is seen scraping by for enough money to survive on her own. She's forced to pawn her heirlooms and work as a bicycle messenger. She's struggling to get by and yet her pride is standing between her and a massive fortune. This is just stupid. What's to stop Lara from signing the paperwork, inheriting the fortune, and using said fortune to continue the search for her father? There's also the motivation of her absentee father, who left to thwart the bad guys from finding the special tomb. However, he inadvertently leads them there because he was tracked. Had he not even left, the bad guys would not have found the island's location and he could have been in Lara's life. This is transparent potting to simply move the pieces across a board. Another example is Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) a ship captain ally she picks up that serves no real purpose other than ferrying her to the island. One character that benefits from motivation is the villain, Vogel. He's not some mustache-twirling rogue but rather a guy hired for a job that wants to go home and see his kids again. It's a nice, empathetic touch that makes Vogel grounded and a better fit.Tomb Raider is a smaller, leaner, and enjoyable little action movie of modest ambitions. That sounds very conditional, I'll admit, but it's a scaled-down version of an exaggerated character doing splashy, sexy, exaggerated action heroics. It's a stripped down reboot that grounds the action while still finding enough ways to have fun. It does get a little caught up in the edicts of an origin tale, overpowering moments with ""First"" significance (First Adventure, First Kill, First Fight, etc.). There are also some head-scratching plot holes that get glossed over to keep things moving along. Vikander is one tough cookie, and the film celebrates her brains as well as her brawn and absent any ogling camerawork. Tomb Raider is a suitably exciting action film that gives some hope for future Croft adventures.Nate's Grade: B","Tomb Raider",9792,2.7,-0.8
"9793",1,"  Alicia Vikander tries to replicate Angelina Jolie's failure of a performance in this failed blockbuster hit. As this unfortunately is the best video-game movie of all time, it is a failed attempt of such a great game released in 2016.","Tomb Raider",9793,2.7,1.7

"9795",4,"  After seeing this movie with a long anticipated wait, I was rather happy money was spent to see on the big screen. There was quite a bit of a different take on this movies story line especially when it came to Lara's father. The puzzles could have been a more tricky and more interesting to see being solved. There were a few major scenes taken from the newer 2013-15 games that were incorporated into the movie which made me very happy. The actress was an amazing take on a modern Lara Croft ( in her younger days when she first started out raiding tombs... or fighting mercenaries at best). I feel like there could have been more squeezed into the movie that would have made t better. The adventure Lara went on as well as running into Mathias and his gang, could have had more. Also, what Lara does with her iconic necklace really bothered me even the at the end,","Tomb Raider",9795,2.7,-1.3
"9796",5,"  This is by far the best video game movie ever made!When I first saw the trailers for the movie I was skeptic that the movie would do well. My initial reactions were: (1) the lead actress did not resemble Lara Croft, and (2) the most recent video game movies (Warcraft and Assassins Creed) both did horribly.Boy was I wrong and happy to be so. The cast of the movie was believable, charismatic, and genuinely brought their characters to life. The story was tight with a great balance of action, humor, and emotion. I especially love that the film did not try to incorporate any cliches.In my opinion, if this movie is an example of what video game movies can become then we gamers are in for some good times. Here's me hoping that this film gets a sequel.","Tomb Raider",9796,2.7,-2.3

For a film that obviously had a good budget, the directing and story-line choices were abysmal at times. Worse though was the completely misguided casting of Lara Croft. Not once did I connect with Alicia Vikander which is too bad because she normally is a likable actor.

Vikander tries hard, but she doesn't have the screen magnetism to play such a beloved character.

"9825",3,"  Tomb Raider is now the third feature film adaptation of Square Enix's game series, this time around Lara Croft is portrayed by Alicia Vikander no longer Angelina Jolie of the original first two films.Lara Croft is the heir to the Croft family her father has been missing for quite sometime and she's very independent, she doesn't feel the need to take any of this money; but once she uncovers some truths about her father and a possible location where he may have gone missing, she sets out on her very first adventure to find him.This film is very much based on the 2013 reboot game and it follows it very closely, many visual elements from that game carry over to this film including tiptoeing across a plane that's stuck in a waterfall or tiptoeing across a tree that's fallen over a cliff, surviving a lot of falls even certain wounds that she gets are straight out of the game.When she comes face to face with danger and a life-threatening situation in which she has to make a terrible choice, it plays out similar to the game and in that way, this is one of the most visually faithful video game adaptations ever made.This film was directed by Roar Uthaug and with him he's brought a good sense of momentum, he understands the important stepping stones that have to be present to setup Lara Croft as the Tomb Raider we know her to be and all the things that have to happen for that development to make sense. Her first Adventure, her first kill, her first wound she has to dress all of these are setup fairly well and that's my biggest takeaway as a positive from this movie is the character of Lara Croft has never been portrayed in a film more realistically and better.Alicia Vikander is really good in this movie, she honours this character so well and whether or not fans end up liking this movie or not I think the majority will walk away happy with the portrayal of Croft on the big screen.As someone who is a fan of the games, who has played most of them, I was overall happy with this adaptation, it has a few issues storytelling wise and in the first acts pacing, but I think Tomb Raider fans will mostly be happy, it's not great film by any means it has a lot of silly elements and for the most part it's just a fun action thriller.","Tomb Raider",9825,2.7,-0.3
"9826",2,"  Vikander is entirely misplaced in this generic clapboard house of a script, delivering hackneyed lines of dialogue to drive home predictable emotions and an equally predictable storyline riddled with plot holes. This is no fun to watch.","Tomb Raider",9826,2.7,0.7
"9827",5,"  its a good movie that you need to go see","Tomb Raider",9827,2.7,-2.3
"9828",3,"  Watched it a second time, and enjoyed it more. The sound throughout the film is well crafted. From the soundtrack that revs up your emotions at the suspense or the sounds within the film the characters hear and that are heightened so the audience is cued into what is important. The archery she did as a kid was a cleverly placed flashback since she used it and it is a motif of the whole film. She could have so easily killed the bad guys by pushing them into the many chasms. Plot line was well organized. Humorous throughout. I definitely want to box. and do a bike fox hunt. Incredulous that she escaped death by rocks at the end, but whatever. There will undoubtably be a second movie.","Tomb Raider",9828,2.7,-0.3
"9829",4,"  This movie is certainly a step up from other video game movies, A+ for Alicia Vikander and the fathers casting ????????????????????","Tomb Raider",9829,2.7,-1.3
"9830",0.5,"  This is an origin movie between the Assassins and the Abstergo Templars. And the Assasin's name is Bruce Wayne.SPOILERS:I didn't want to write ""SPOILERS""... since the movie already ruined it for you at the beginning by mentioning the existence of Himiko and Yamatai island anyway...But...Faithfully? Really? After they change the motive of Himiko from a villain with a desire to be reborn to a savior to keep deadly virus out? The huge take of the game was on supernatural phenomenon of how Himiko can control weather, summon mythical creatures or transfer souls ceremonially. Yet, instead, the director came up with what he thinks that make sense to him and invent a disease for the sake of the potential of making it into a bioweapon - just to introduce Trinity ( for sequel purposes ). The whole supernatural thing were being mentioned all movie long yet completely ignored at the end of the movie. This movie is a disaster - I am indignant that such a good origin story of Lara Croft wasted on the needs of being logical. Lara ending up fighting against trinity is analogues to Ezios against Abstergo. In fact, this would make a great AC Origins movie. Oh yea, btw, Lara is rich because of her dad's inheritance (thus the Bruce Wayne part).Speaking of being logical, the decision made by Clara wasn't so sense-making: in the scene in which Lara tried to stop the Trinity guy from escaping with the Virus, while the villain was on the step ladder that connects the cliffs, Lara chose to jump along onto the ladder rather than to remove the ladder so then the dude would just fall into the abyss (chasm of souls). One might argue that she didn't want to take lives... Yea, do a body count of the people died on her arrow tip as she went to steal the radio walkie-talkie. Absolutely ruined the scene that toughened her up by the waterfall and her first kill near the cave. She is just a daddy's girl towards the end.","Tomb Raider",9830,2.7,2.2
"9831",3,"  It was entertaining but had plenty of silliness such as a woman with a bow and arrow taking on guys with machine guns.....successfully. But it was fun and ok entertainment. Lots of action.","Tomb Raider",9831,2.7,-0.3
"9832",2.5,"  Story was not great but there were some fun parts. Lara carries the movie, she seems to be good in everything I have seen her in. Better story could get Part 2 much higher rated.","Tomb Raider",9832,2.7,0.2
"9833",3.5,"  Great action and good plot. Alicia Vikander crushed this role. I am so in love. This is a flawed movie, but overall it was entertaining and a fun watch.","Tomb Raider",9833,2.7,-0.8

"9835",5,"  Amazing movie! Alicia Vikander was amazing.","Tomb Raider",9835,2.7,-2.3
"9836",1,"  The movie was just to unrealistic I'm mean at no point of the movie did I feel suspense because the characters could jump of a plane and then run 30 miles per hour not to mention there being a scrappy plot I almost left the Theater because I hated the movie so much spoiler ...............It a Laurel Croft movie not the ya no what the movie was so forgetbel I fort the fathers last name they should have keeled him dead theye was literally no porous for the father to be in the movie I think that it would have been even better if she never knew how her father died it was and all and wast of your money and more importantly the two hours of your life that you spent watching it now don't get me wrong the actress that plaid Laura did a good job in the role but the movie still sucked it was like watching a gif of a cat falling of a tree for two hours go see another movie oh and if you aren't watching this movie please don't go see a wrinkle in time trust me your safer renting at home or simply slamming your face agents the wall for two hours then wasting your time and going to see this movie that's all have to say ??","Tomb Raider",9836,2.7,1.7

"9839",0.5,"  this movie was very bad","Tomb Raider",9839,2.7,2.2
"9840",4.5,"  Not the greatest story ever told, but it was at least logical and entertaining. I'd watch it twice and hope for a sequel","Tomb Raider",9840,2.7,-1.8
"9841",4,"  More action than the previous ones, this establishes Lara Croft's story beautifully. Excellent female action role! Very fast paced, and lacking some of the fantastical elements of the previous two films.","Tomb Raider",9841,2.7,-1.3
"9842",2.5,"  I mean it gives me an Uncharted: Drakes Fortune vibe. Just nowhere near as epic. Still, good acting and stunts.","Tomb Raider",9842,2.7,0.2
"9843",3,"  The movie was well done, it really feels like the games in a lot of ways. It's not a GREAT film, but it is good. It felt a bit predictable at times. Plot was good, but a bit cliche. I'd give it 6.5-7 out of ten.","Tomb Raider",9843,2.7,-0.3
"9844",4,"  Tomb Raider uses a more realistic and sensible approach to tell a simple story of a compelling protagonist brilliantly played by Alicia Vikander, making the film a lot more entertaining rather than the horrid mess that the franchise was in before.","Tomb Raider",9844,2.7,-1.3
"9845",5,"  I love the way they bring my favourite character to the big screen!","Tomb Raider",9845,2.7,-2.3

"9851",5,"  Better than what Angelina Jolie crapped out.","Tomb Raider",9851,2.7,-2.3
"9852",5,"  I approached this with caution, video game movies being what they are etc. However, this is a stand out, Vikander is excellent and the nods the the game are good and don't break your immersion. My favourite video game movie by a long shot. My only complaint would be some annoying music near the start, it's the type you either love or hate and that not great for the first chase/action sequence.","Tomb Raider",9852,2.7,-2.3
"9853",3.5,"  I would just like to say that it was a pretty good attempt to deliver a good video game adaption.Why they changed Lara's career choice or strayed away so much from the material they had in the game is out of my mind. It would've worked better to follow the game a bit more closely, I get that they needed to fill out the movie with characters since the game has a lot fewer and a lot of solo time going. But it would've been nice to follow her in tombs and solving more puzzles. But they wanted to create something new, easier to follow perhaps? But if they get the chance to do a sequel I think it will be better :)","Tomb Raider",9853,2.7,-0.8
"9854",3.5,"  3.5 stars. Good solid movie. Extremely good acting job by Alicia Vikander. But... if you were a fan of the 2013 video game then you might be slightly disappointed because the game had a deeper, darker plot. Also, do not expect anything supernatural in this film.","Tomb Raider",9854,2.7,-0.8
"9855",4.5,"  I saw Tomb Raider last night with my wife and a few of our friends and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I believe this is the best adaptation of a video game to film yet. Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance with some great supporting actors in the film. The plot was well done with a little bit of pacing issues during the second act. The costumes were great, the CGI effects were very well done (better than Black Panther imo), and the scenery and shooting of the scenes were great! Highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a fun, action film with great call-backs to the 2012 Tomb Raider video game. 4.5/5 stars","Tomb Raider",9855,2.7,-1.8
"9856",3.5,"  Great beginning to a great franchise. Not only the great acting but also a better origin story than the first series. If there will be a sequel pretty sure that fans will get to see the ""wealthy, playgirl in shorts with her guns"" type Lara Croft.","Tomb Raider",9856,2.7,-0.8
"9857",3.5,"  Very entertaining! Not just another White hero worshiping movie! Actually, it was but I'm White, so keep'em coming, we want to program the entire world to hero worship us! Loved the action sequences!","Tomb Raider",9857,2.7,-0.8
"9858",5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great action, great origin story and a great cast. Alicia Vikander really is Lara Croft! Can't wait for the sequel.","Tomb Raider",9858,2.7,-2.3
"9859",4,"  Little slow at points, but was true to the video game without being too campy. Much better then the previous iterations of the film","Tomb Raider",9859,2.7,-1.3
"9860",5,"  Finally a worth while tomb raider movie. Deff looking forward to more from this actress felt she played rebooted lara perfectly","Tomb Raider",9860,2.7,-2.3
"9861",5,"  Awesome! I was geeking out massively!","Tomb Raider",9861,2.7,-2.3
"9862",3,"  On the face of it, Tomb Raider isn't ground-breaking stuff. It's a competent, enjoyable enough blockbuster; a decent popcorn flick, but still hasn't got anything on the likes of Indiana Jones. Still, this is the first time a movie based on a videogame hasn't been flat out bad - so perhaps there's more to praise here than you may think. And judging by the end, a sequel will soon be on the horizon. Let's hope Lara can hit an even bigger target next time out.","Tomb Raider",9862,2.7,-0.3
"9863",5,"  Best game adaption to date and the actor is perfect for the part. Action packed, while it sacrificed a little in screenplay, it more than made up for emotionally invested acting.","Tomb Raider",9863,2.7,-2.3
"9864",3,"  I enjoyed the film, the acting and visuals were fine, but they cheated on the script writing, some terribly written parts.","Tomb Raider",9864,2.7,-0.3
"9865",3,"  It wasn't phenomenally crafted in any aspect, but Alicia Vikander does a great job and by God the movie is just downright fun. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a solid action film. Excited to see where the series goes.","Tomb Raider",9865,2.7,-0.3
"9866",3.5,"  I couldn't believe how close this was to the 2014 video game! Well at least the first quarter of the film was then I have no idea where they were going with it. Alicia Vikander definitely nailed the role a hell of a lot better than Jolie did..those movies were a joke. Vikander definitely held this film together and knew the role of Lara Croft very well, as a gamer and a fan of the Tomb Raider Video Game Franchise, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the film actually was.","Tomb Raider",9866,2.7,-0.8
"9867",5,"  I went to see this movie hoping that it would be better than the originals with Jolie and I came away impressed. I liked the gritty look and feel of the movie. There was none of the campiness of the originals which I was glad to see. With it being basically an origin film, there was some setup in the beginning which was expected but interesting to see her backstory. Once the adventure began, the pacing was excellent all the way to the end. and left the theater impressed. Alicia did an excellent job portraying Lara Croft and her acting was spot on. I will be going to see this movie again.","Tomb Raider",9867,2.7,-2.3
"9868",2,"  This is the kind of movie enjoyed mostly by teens that have never seen that genre type of movie. Alicia is great as is the action and SFX. Definitely a fun 3D Matinee movie for the newbies to the genre. Lesson here, listen to your father.","Tomb Raider",9868,2.7,0.7
"9869",5,"  I saw the movie after reading the reviews. However, myself and my girlfriend really enjoyed it! I thought the character development was well done, and the story was better than most movies of this nature. Plus I think Vikander was a great choice. Overall, i left feeling entertained and happy with the movie and would recommend it.","Tomb Raider",9869,2.7,-2.3
"9870",5,"  Loved it, action and adventure packed. THISis why you see movies at the theater!","Tomb Raider",9870,2.7,-2.3
"9871",3,"  As an avid fan of the video games (original and reboot) I was let down. Lara's father story was irrelevant.","Tomb Raider",9871,2.7,-0.3
"9872",3.5,"  Took the family to see this one over the weekend. I was the only one that played the game that this movie is based off of. Overall we were pretty impressed, by far one of the best video game adaptation movies made. It's a fun time, my daughters enjoyed all the girl power, and Alicia Vikander did a great job as always. It's not earth shattering or genre defying/defining but it is a fun time at the movies. My only displeasure and sort of a **SPOILER ALERT** was the removal of supernatural elements that the game had.","Tomb Raider",9872,2.7,-0.8
"9873",4,"  I went into this movie thinking it was going to a pretty good video game flick. It lived up to that expectation and I'd have no qualms watching it again. The movie had several nods to the video game and had a good storyline to keep up a decent pace.There were a couple incongruent character decisions and one or two cheesy lines, but they're inconsequential.","Tomb Raider",9873,2.7,-1.3
"9874",2.5,"  Such a disappointment after the first run. The villain was lame, and all he did was reach for his gun over and over and over. She was not Lara, she was too naive. No, I couldn't stay the whole movie.","Tomb Raider",9874,2.7,0.2
"9875",5,"  Alicia Vikander does an awesome job as Lara Croft. No really into the whole video game thing, but it doesn't matter, the movie is definitely worth seeing.","Tomb Raider",9875,2.7,-2.3
"9876",5,"  This is why I hate critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Listen, if you're a fan of the Tomb Raider movies and especially the reboot games-- you will have a love for the simplicity of the movie. It was great! It brought back many actual scenes from the Tomb Raider Survivor game and made them real life! Many of my gamer friends went to see it together and all agreed it was light, enjoyable, touching and just an enjoyable experience. I'm going back to watch it again before the opening week ends. Alicia Vikander did an amazing job as Lara without making her whole plot sound and feel cringy and tacky like previous tomb raider movies. This is the best tomb raider movie out to date and you should definitely IGNORE Rotten Tomatoes score and give it a go yourself. Than come back and tell the world what you think :D","Tomb Raider",9876,2.7,-2.3
"9877",5,"  This movie was awesome and powerful and just all-around fun. Alicia Vikander did an incredible job as Lara, and she REALLY makes you feel like you're right there with Lara feeling everything she feels. Her vulnerability combined with her incredible physical fitness is remarkable to see. Definitely one to watch again and again!","Tomb Raider",9877,2.7,-2.3
"9878",3.5,"  I honestly enjoyed this movie. I will start out with what I considered the negatives. The screenplay could have used some more work and hopefully if their is a sequel that happens. The villain (while played well by Walton Goggins) needed a better screenplay and maybe some flashbacks of his own? I also wish Daniel Wu got a little more screen time, but maybe they can bring him back in the sequel and explore him more. I really like him in Into the Badlands. Now, for the positives. Vikander owned the role completely. She is the spitting image of the character from the last couple games which is what they are going for. She put tons of work in physically getting fit for the role and doing her own stunts to great effect. And of course he performance was magnetic. She was emotional when she needed to be, fierce when she needed to be, and literally just about perfect. This is what you could hope for when an actor picks up an iconic role. Next, the action in the film was nice. I loved all the action where it bassically just showed her trying to survive (if you consider that action?). I loved it because it showed her awesome stunt work and all those sequences were really thrilling! The ship scene, the chase scene, the river scene, the fight scene where she kills, her bow and arrow run, inside the pyramid/tunnel scenes. Loved those. And it got me hype for a sequel with the ending reveals, and showing her with her Iconic 2 guns.","Tomb Raider",9878,2.7,-0.8
"9879",5,"  If you like the video games and want to see a good representation of that. This is it.","Tomb Raider",9879,2.7,-2.3
"9880",1.5,"  The film does not bring anything new. On the end is quite boring action film, where on many places I was asking my self: ""Why will she do that"".","Tomb Raider",9880,2.7,1.2
"9881",0.5,"  I'll keep this very simple, slapping the name Tomb Raider does not give permission to make a crappy movie and expect people to pay for it.This movie had plenty of plot holes, the chosen Lara Croft was not the best choice and the CG in this trashy movie is cheap.","Tomb Raider",9881,2.7,2.2
"9882",5,"  Loved characters and action. Backstory could be better but as fan from games that doesn't bother me personally.","Tomb Raider",9882,2.7,-2.3
"9883",3,"  the movie was entertaining, very like the video game, but it didn't have much staying power","Tomb Raider",9883,2.7,-0.3
"9884",5,"  Alicia Vikander delivered a memorable performance and was an amazing representation of the Tomb Raider series. The film had so many intense and surprising moments that kept me wanting more! As a huge fan of the video game series, I definitely think the film did justice to the series. The plot change from the rebooted game was a great idea to keep it fresh while also keeping some elements from the game. They even kept some things in the plot and backstory to explore in potential sequels. I look forward to future titles if they continue the on-screen adaptations.","Tomb Raider",9884,2.7,-2.3
"9885",3.5,"  This is a paint by numbers action movie by a director that honestly I feel didnt try to hard to go beyond that. BUT what this movie does have is Alicia Vikander who gives every ounce of her soul to being Lara Croft. The game takes many beats from the rebooted game franchise that gives the movie some of its best set pieces. Vikander makes this movie and deserves more chances to prove that Lara Croft can be a bad ass heroine for this generation.","Tomb Raider",9885,2.7,-0.8
"9886",5,"  Loved it. I though the film is the very best of the Tomb Raider films.","Tomb Raider",9886,2.7,-2.3
"9887",2,"  This movie has so many things going wrong with it - her origin, plot points, dialogue, to name a few - that the few good things are just forgotten. I recommend playing the games.","Tomb Raider",9887,2.7,0.7
"9888",3.5,"  I enjoyed Tomb Raider. Don't let the low critic scores chase you away.Seriously. Was it some cinematic masterpiece?Of course not. We're talking about latter-day Hollywood here.Was it entertaining? Hell yeah! I had fun and was never really taken out of the movie by anything. So it did its job. It deserved the money I spent on my ticket.I'm not sure why it's suddenly cool to hate on game-tied and comic-tied movies.But go, see it, form YOUR OWN opinion!","Tomb Raider",9888,2.7,-0.8
"9889",5,"  Fast, straight forward!!!!Alicia Vikander is the best person for this role. Much better than Jolie in my opinion","Tomb Raider",9889,2.7,-2.3

"9891",3.5,"  Not amazing, however, quite entertaining movie with a story which follows the game plot closely.","Tomb Raider",9891,2.7,-0.8
"9892",2,"  Even Alicia Vikander is better than Angelina, the movie is very so-so. Waste of time and money.","Tomb Raider",9892,2.7,0.7
"9893",5,"  This movie is everything a Tomb Raider movie should be. It gives us contemporary Lara Croft in full force, with a new depth to her character that subverts the now outdated Lara known mainly for her big breasts. Like the video games, the story is heavily puzzle-based, the audience led to work them out alongside Lara, which is exactly what I was hoping to see. Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and my whole family had a good time.","Tomb Raider",9893,2.7,-2.3
"9894",5,"  Alicia kicked ass, good story, directed well.","Tomb Raider",9894,2.7,-2.3
"9895",5,"  Clearly, some of the disparities amongst reviews are due to the fact that many reviewers are doing so from the ""video game movie"" point of view, and that's fine.Simply as a free-standing film not related to any video game, however, I found TR to be a highly watchable, entertaining film.In reading many of the reviews here, it seems that - not entirely but by and large - most fans of the video game dislike this second movie version, while far more of those who have not played the game or simply went to see TR on its own merits as a film enjoyed it.For me, I believe this version tells a compelling, granted fantastical story, in a simple, exciting, fast-paced manner. Whereas some might say Jolie's portrayal was more overt and exciting, I felt that Vikander brought a certain subtlety and texture to the role while maintaining the physicality of the first film.Yes, on some levels it's a ""mash-up"" of certain aspects of National Treasure / Raiders / Assassins Creed, and not done as well of any of them, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a very enjoyable film.Is it faithful to the video game? That's for gamer moviegoers to decide and express, and they are right here on RT.But for the rest of us, maybe this TR and Vikander have taken a story to where a new generation of filmgoers who are unfamiliar with TR The Video Game can very, very much appreciate it. I know I did.","Tomb Raider",9895,2.7,-2.3
"9896",4,"  Really enjoyable, I didn't have the highest expectations from viewings of the trailer, but I really enjoyed it. It was my first cinema trip for over a month due to travelling, so it was just the ticket in San Jose, Costa Rica.","Tomb Raider",9896,2.7,-1.3

"9899",4,"  Best video game to movie adaptation so far. Vikander clearly fits the role of the new Lara Croft. Unlike the old movie, the new 2018 reboot cuts away the unrealistic video game fantasy without hurting the source material. I hope to see a worthy sequel to this one!","Tomb Raider",9899,2.7,-1.3
"9900",4,"  For what the movie is meant to be, it delivered what was promised. The movie excelled at showing what a strong female character looks like. Instead of telling the audience she is strong, the movie shows it through action. I would not rate this as the best movie of all timer,however it is perhaps the best videogame movie, and I would not mind owning it on dvd. Critics rate it at 49%, but are idiots. I would give it a 75%. There was little wrong with the movie, and does nothing to deserve such a lower score.","Tomb Raider",9900,2.7,-1.3
"9901",4,"  An enjoyable popcorn flick. Tomb Raider is strongest when the focus is on either Alicia Vikander or when puzzle/exploration elements are in play, but the film does suffer from a middle act after introducing a character that removes so much of the heroines' ability to focus on herself. Had the film given its time to Lara Crofts need to survive and overcome, this could have easily been an excellent starting film for a franchise. Having said that, I look forward to more from this actress and the world of Tomb Raider if they move on from origins and into some more tomb raiding.","Tomb Raider",9901,2.7,-1.3
"9902",5,"  Tomb Raider (2018) has exceeded my expectations. Alicia Vikander's portrayal of Lara is on point: not only does she humanise her, but she also manages to be a badass, as well.","Tomb Raider",9902,2.7,-2.3
"9903",3,"  ok, not as much fun as old ones","Tomb Raider",9903,2.7,-0.3
"9904",4.5,"  Great origin story and Roar Uthaug has a really good eye for action.","Tomb Raider",9904,2.7,-1.8
"9905",4,"  I really enjoyed this movie and this rendition of Lara Croft. Some of the puzzles were too conviently solved, but I was entertained throughout the film and I really dug the spin at the end, which was in line with the rebooted video games. I can't wait to see where this film goes next with the sequels. Alicia Vicander is the perfect Lara Croft for this generation of fans.","Tomb Raider",9905,2.7,-1.3
"9906",3,"  Tomb Raider (the movie) doesn't really feel like Tomb Raider (the video game). This film explores the origins of Lara Croft, so the character isn't quite her rich, confident, tough self yet--which makes you feel kind of bad for Alicia Vikander as she's getting beat up by the elements and by other characters. Still, it's an entertaining, though fairly predictable, adventure movie.","Tomb Raider",9906,2.7,-0.3
"9907",3.5,"  Good simple pulpy fun","Tomb Raider",9907,2.7,-0.8
"9908",4,"  Fun movie - went I; with low expectations based on ""rotten"" score but were pleasantly surprised. Lara needs to work on her scream though. She sounds like a 10 year old when she screams. This movie isn't without faults but is still worth seeing in the theater.","Tomb Raider",9908,2.7,-1.3
"9909",4,"  Alica Vikander makes a great Lara Croft from the 2nd series of the game in this reboot. Some great hat tips to the video games. It's a fun action and adventure movie with a nice plot, good effects and great acting.","Tomb Raider",9909,2.7,-1.3
"9910",4,"  When I first saw the trailers for this, I didn't think she could pull it off, but she did the character justice. Not only that, she looked great doing it.","Tomb Raider",9910,2.7,-1.3
"9911",4.5,"  Excellent movie entertaining","Tomb Raider",9911,2.7,-1.8
"9912",2,"  The trailer led us to believe that it would follow the fantastic video game closely. It does at first but then it became a huge let down. I kept waiting for the scary elements and supernatural events to happen that took place in the game. But the movie does a complete 180 to remain realistic. If you haven't played the game then the movie might be entertaining. Just another average video game movie/","Tomb Raider",9912,2.7,0.7

"9915",3,"  It's an okay action movie although Alicia Vikander is a standout bringing a rare combination of physicality and elegance as the new Lara Croft. Looking forward to seeing where they can take the series with her leading.","Tomb Raider",9915,2.7,-0.3
"9916",5,"  I loved this movie. I would rate it even higher than Black Panther honestly.","Tomb Raider",9916,2.7,-2.3
"9917",2,"  Such a shame that another interesting franchise has devolved into just another shoot-em-up with pretty CGI. The backdrops are great and no lack of action scenes. Characters are cliche and uninteresting (except perhaps for the pawn dealer). Story (do we even care about stories anymore?) felt like an afterthought.","Tomb Raider",9917,2.7,0.7
"9918",5,"  Very good movie overall! Good modification from the original game!","Tomb Raider",9918,2.7,-2.3
"9919",4,"  This is a good prequel to the Tomb Raider saga. For fans of the game, especially Rise of the Tomb Raider, you'll recognize many elements from the game. As action movies go, I don't understand the overly critical reviews and definitely side with the audience score (70%) on this one!","Tomb Raider",9919,2.7,-1.3
"9920",3,"  Incredible, as in not believable. This Tomb Raider is OK and soooo close to being good. Tomb Raider is not inspired by the video games; it is the LC reboot video game. I am fond of Alicia Vikander's work. She is certainly trying to make the best of what she is given here. The problem with this Tomb Raider is mostly in the story construction. It hits all the informational beats, but it is almost frenetic about it. Almost as soon as she is on a boat for the mysterious island, they are having to abandon it. When they could quietly try to evade the evil guards, our heroes quickly get into an avoidable shootout. This movie is a visual storyboard construction, with action scenes at almost every turn. Some of the running-from-danger CG is very video game like and so not believable, it knocked me out the believing the story. TR should have been released mid-summer as mindless entertainment. There are the emotional backstory moments between Lara and her father. The villain is not great, even though the writers give it a go. He has been on the island for 7 years away from his daughters. The time and isolation make him a bit crazy. He complains about not having anyone to talk to, although there appears to be a lot of people under his ""command"" on this island. The intention was to make him come off as complex, but ultimately he a pretty simple bad guy. There are attempts to capitalize on the #girlpower momentum and to be a bit like Wonder Woman, but Croft is no demi-god. She suffers a ""practically"" unrecoverable abdominal wound that should have simply been cut of the story. Croft gets really beat up, by villians and jungle terrain, but seems to come out with only a few scratches, aside from the aforementioned wound. The 2001 Angelina Jolie Raider, introduced us to a Lara who was in command of her money and training to do danger missions. This Vikander bicycle messenger fails to get me to suspend my belief as much. There is an airplane scene where life threatening events are stacked one upon another, during which Croft sums up my issues with this movie nicely by looking straight at the camera and saying ""Really?!"". The best cameo is by Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead). I loved him for his 3 to 4 minutes of footage. The character I am really sorry for is Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu, because in the role reversal, he basically gets sidelined as the almost pointless damsel in distress.","Tomb Raider",9920,2.7,-0.3
"9921",5,"  Go see this fun, thrilling movie! Don't listen to the wanna be critics, the fact that the movie is based on a video game story line doesn't take away from the fact that it is an excellent written and directed action fantasy movie. Go and enjoy it and make your own judgement. You will like it. Definitely.","Tomb Raider",9921,2.7,-2.3
"9922",5,"  Very satisfying movie with great actors!","Tomb Raider",9922,2.7,-2.3
"9923",4,"  Great reboot. The story could have been a little stronger, but this was a realistic adventure movie with no stupid sarcasm. Believable action scenes and Alicia is a 100% better Lara Croft. I look forward to the next in the series.","Tomb Raider",9923,2.7,-1.3
"9924",5,"  Loved the movie. For someone who didn't play the game this is a story of a great adventure any young rebellious girl would love to be in.","Tomb Raider",9924,2.7,-2.3
"9925",5,"  Possibly the best video game adaptation to date. If you enjoyed the latest two Tomb Raider games, you'll likely enjoy this movie. It's heavily inspired by both games, borrowing pieces of each and then weaving its own story, that still fits nicely in the TR mythos. Alicia Vikander is perfect in the role and is a much more believable Lara than Angelina Jolie ever was, though it probably helps that the character itself is more fleshed out in these ""reboots"" and isn't merely a sex symbol. The film clearly sets up what is hopefully a long and fruitful franchise. I'm certainly looking forward to more!","Tomb Raider",9925,2.7,-2.3
"9926",4,"  There is no real depth in the scenario, but what is on the screen is working. Nice depiction of the reboot Lara Croft, as well as a variation on the video game. The movie took liberties on some points and it works very well.","Tomb Raider",9926,2.7,-1.3
"9927",0.5,"  They ate an excellent game and barfed up the good bits, changed parts of the story and paired it with a weak squealing tomb raider who was not able to complete one fight the whole movie on her own.","Tomb Raider",9927,2.7,2.2
"9928",3,"  This is a good movie worth seeing but didn?t give 5 stars and probably is just me but missed Angie In the movie. Guess what I really mean to say is that sense of humor that ran through those movies , she would simply say hmm with that look of hers, after a great one liner gave the movies a feeling of fun. We play games for fun or i do and when that fun is eliminated as much as this adaptation did it lost some of the fantasy that I enjoy.","Tomb Raider",9928,2.7,-0.3
"9929",3,"  A good not great movie that might just might be a turning point for video games being adapted into movies. 74/100.","Tomb Raider",9929,2.7,-0.3
"9930",2.5,"  Pretty good remake , hopefully the sequel will be better","Tomb Raider",9930,2.7,0.2
"9931",4,"  I thought they did a pretty good job this time around, hopefully there will be other movies to come.","Tomb Raider",9931,2.7,-1.3
"9932",2.5,"  The movie is good. But the problem with the movie is that it COMPLETELY removes the third act of the game and has a scooby doo moment where they 'rip of the mask' and say, ""OH, it isn't supernatural after all, its just SCIENCE.""I'm sorry, but they should have never left out Himiko being an actual demon queen and her fuedal japan samurai immortal army that is keeping everyone trapped on the island until the curse is broken. Sad part is, the movie is actually good until they scooby doo'd it.","Tomb Raider",9932,2.7,0.2

"9938",5,"  Great film. Alicia's performance being the best part about it. Great way of seriously portraying Lara's origin story without taking away from the video games. Great job!","Tomb Raider",9938,2.7,-2.3
"9939",2.5,"  Adequate... Father daughter story with some action and adventure sprinkled in there, but nothing special even with the toned Vikander on screen.","Tomb Raider",9939,2.7,0.2
"9940",5,"  I enjoyed this thrill ride from start to finish.","Tomb Raider",9940,2.7,-2.3
"9941",5,"  Just came back from watching Tomb Raider and I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was unsure if we needed another origin story but I guess if they are taking the character in a different direction then it makes sense. Alicia Vikander makes a great Laura Croft and is a more vulnerable character than the previous incarnation. There are elements of the film which are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones which can not be a bad thing. Overall very enjoyable and is set up nicely for a sequel. I took my 11 year old daughter and 14 year son and they both loved the film.","Tomb Raider",9941,2.7,-2.3
"9942",4,"  I thought it was a pretty enjoyable early summer action flick. Everything was pretty well choreographed, the villain filled the role in a serviceable way and I thought Alicia Vikander did a stand-up job (much better than Angelina Jolie).","Tomb Raider",9942,2.7,-1.3
"9943",5,"  I just got done seeing this movie I am frankly baffled by the bad reviews this movie is getting. I such a fun time viewing this film. The graphics are great. The action is executed exceptionally. Alicia Vikander really steals show. Her acting is above and beyond what would be considered adequate. Honestly, I don't know why I'm not seeing for articles talking about another great female role model being introduced. This Lara Croft is absolutely a better role model for girls than Wonder Woman. Best video game-based movie ever. Awesome","Tomb Raider",9943,2.7,-2.3
"9944",2.5,"  Fun but way too predictable. I was expecting way more than what it was delivered.","Tomb Raider",9944,2.7,0.2
"9945",5,"  The story is good it takes alot of the story from the 2013 game does have changes that in my opinion worked well one big difference is a character that's in the game but alot more is done with the character in the movie which I liked other characters from the game that traveled with Lara aren't in the movie but that was fine with me the villain is alright isn't nothing crazy about the villain .alica vikander is really good as Lara croft I loved her. The action is fun the hole movie is fun. The cgi is really good.","Tomb Raider",9945,2.7,-2.3
"9946",4.5,"  If you like the new games and understand where they are going with the story, then you will enjoy this movie. The action is non stop and the effects are great. It's not an award winning movie but it is very entertaining and actors all do very well. I would definitely recommend it and I hope they continue this story.","Tomb Raider",9946,2.7,-1.8
"9947",4,"  Just got back and was skeptical of this reboot and Alicia being cast as Lara Croft but I loved it!","Tomb Raider",9947,2.7,-1.3
"9948",4.5,"  Great reboot of the franchise! Just what the fans needed. Vikander was amazing and really leveled up Laura Croft with an amazing performance. No lame James Bond gadgets of tired one-liners. Can't wait for the next one!","Tomb Raider",9948,2.7,-1.8
"9949",3.5,"  This movie was slightly underwhelming as an action adventure film, but next to either of the Jolie films, it looks like a masterpiece of cinema. Vikander makes the role her own for sure, though the script doesn't give her a lot to work with, and the characters and dialogue in general are pretty thin and uninteresting - especially Walter ""can't we just go home"" Goggins antagonist 'Mathias'. The film serves as a good potential kick off for a Vikander run as the character, just not very much else.","Tomb Raider",9949,2.7,-0.8
"9950",4.5,"  Excellent video game adaptation to the big screen. Alicia Vikander is absolutely spectacular as the new Lara Croft. Having played the game series for two decades, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I very much look forward to a sequel!!","Tomb Raider",9950,2.7,-1.8
"9951",5,"  I Really enjoyed it. Alicia was fantastic as Lara Croft - Bravo. The film was very true to the games.","Tomb Raider",9951,2.7,-2.3
"9952",3,"  As a big fan of the recent Tomb Raider prequel video games Alicia Vikander was phenomenal as a young Lara Croft. More real and relatable for today's gen and a total badass with her share of cuts and bruises - to see this acclaimed dramatic actress pull off such physical grit showcases her strong versatility. However the film underserved her and the game's story caliber (it spent a lot of time exploring the father-daughter relationship instead of more screen time better served on the core story - they hardly infuse the more exciting spirit of mythology, discovery, and learning that makes the game and even the first tomb raider film so enjoyable). It did have some excellent inspired action scenes and combat. It was a decent effort but sad not enough it seems to truly re-ignite great potential and mass interest. I hope they take it next level if it gets a sequel - Alicia definitely deserves it and so does the franchise based on its latest takes.","Tomb Raider",9952,2.7,-0.3
"9953",5,"  Enjoyable movie and don't understand why critics are hating on it. Hands down the best Tomb Raider movie. I enjoyed it and actually excited to see the sequel that was set up at the end of the movie. I love the actress from Ex Macina.","Tomb Raider",9953,2.7,-2.3
"9954",4,"  It was pretty good, I liked that it tied up all the loose ends of how Lara became Lara. I liked that it wasn't supernatural like the other ones, this had a believable antagonist. Should be a good franchise if they keep this up.","Tomb Raider",9954,2.7,-1.3
"9955",4.5,"  Vikander gets an A+ for depicting a believable as possible video game character. I'm not a gamer but could see the storyboard imagery underlying every scene. The zing was there in every shot. Emotional focus on finding her father remained real, lensing merged seamlessly with CGI. A little more story/emotional involvement of supporting characters would have made the film that tad bit better, but this is a great franchise reboot. The tone was Indiana Jones meets Mission Impossible. Vikander is Ethan Hunt!","Tomb Raider",9955,2.7,-1.8
"9956",3,"  Loved Alicia, liked the movie. Overall it was fun with a lackluster villain. Reminded me of Last Crusade mixed with The Rundown.","Tomb Raider",9956,2.7,-0.3
"9957",3.5,"  What could have ended up as just a formulaic action film is elevated due to Alica Vikander, who plays her role perfectly","Tomb Raider",9957,2.7,-0.8
"9958",4,"  Great movie! Keeps on track with the classics. Fun and kick ass. Everything you could want.","Tomb Raider",9958,2.7,-1.3

"9960",5,"  Love the game!! Movie is awesome!!","Tomb Raider",9960,2.7,-2.3
"9961",2.5,"  It was an good movie. It went by the source material but i was disappointed that they just got rid of the games main cast and the whole fact himiko was Keeping them on the island. It really needed more of Lara fighting for her survival and less of her randomly joining the enemy. The worst thing about this movie is the fact her father is just there. He's alive and him and Lara are happy. But then Lara solves every puzzle and Richard just blew everything up. Overall solid film","Tomb Raider",9961,2.7,0.2
"9962",5,"  It was a much better version compared to the 2001 movie-- much better for young girls to see. not over sexualized.","Tomb Raider",9962,2.7,-2.3
"9963",4,"  Despite a few choices that I wasn't crazy about, I really enjoyed Roar Uthaug's take on the Tomb Raider franchise. It's a fun action film, and it does a great job of filling the ""Indiana Jones""-sized hole in the adventure genre that's been there since ""The Last Crusade"" in 1989. I don't think that the film trods wholly new ground, but I do feel that it does a pretty good job of setting up Lara Croft's world. Alicia Vikander is really terrific in the role, regardless of what you may think of the story, and I'm really hoping that we'll see another outing with her as Lara.","Tomb Raider",9963,2.7,-1.3
"9964",5,"  Love it! Would go and see it again if I had more money","Tomb Raider",9964,2.7,-2.3
"9965",2.5,"  Lara CROFT was excellent. Too bad the story was so boring. I love how at moments it really felt like a video game. but the action wasn't very exciting for me.","Tomb Raider",9965,2.7,0.2
"9966",4,"  This is one Rotten tomatoes is getting wrong, don't listen to the critics and go see this action packed well acted movie. If your a fan of the games you'll enjoy this adaptation, if your not familiar with the games it doesn't matter, you'll still enjoy it.","Tomb Raider",9966,2.7,-1.3
"9967",5,"  The kickass Lara Croft we deserve!","Tomb Raider",9967,2.7,-2.3
"9968",5,"  This reboot is so much better than first 2 movies","Tomb Raider",9968,2.7,-2.3
"9969",1.5,"  Easy watch - very Indiana Jones just not quite as good","Tomb Raider",9969,2.7,1.2
"9970",3.5,"  Very fun movie, Alicia Vikander is aweseome. This is probably the best video game movie out there.","Tomb Raider",9970,2.7,-0.8
"9971",2.5,"  nothing special lot of jumping and grabbing followed by some very dry dialog that seemed forced then more jumping spinning and grapping I recommend you just get the old game out and play","Tomb Raider",9971,2.7,0.2
"9972",3,"  Tomb Raider, starring Alicia Vikander as video game character Lara Croft, is a fun enough adventure movie. Lara's father vanished years ago and she is being pressured to have him declared dead and take his place at the head of the family business. But being the rebellious millennial that she is, she has been refusing to believe he is actually dead. As she is finally almost convinced to accept his death, she finds a clue to where he had gone and so the adventure begins.The film is extremely reminiscent of Indiana Jones and the Final Crusade, which is not surprising. After all, the Lara Croft Tomb Raider games have been referred to before as a female Indiana Jones. The movie hits all the beats of the old adventure serials. It has a spunky hero, eye-catching scenery, exciting action scenes, and a slimy villain. I'm not at all saying it's badly done, just that it's a typical adventure flick. Alicia Vikander is a good Lara Croft. She carries off the physicality of the character and yet shows a certain vulnerability which makes you believe that she has to work at it. I was never bored during Tomb Raider and left the theater feeling satisfied having spent my time with it. I just hope that if it becomes a tentpole series, that they find more inventive storylines.","Tomb Raider",9972,2.7,-0.3
"9973",3.5,"  I thought it was better than I anticipated. Some things were predictable and some were a little too convenient. But all in all it was an entertaining movie and it also humanized Lara Croft which the franchise needed. I liked the grittiness the producers tried to portray.","Tomb Raider",9973,2.7,-0.8
"9974",3.5,"  thought this was a very entertaining, fun loving good pop corn movie. I don't know why the Critics are trashing this movie. It is a fun time worth the money I spent last night. It is a great reboot and Is the best of the Tomb raider movies (which may or may not be saying much to sum). But I hope they make more of them. I love that them made her a plain person that made mistakes. I lovethat it has all the video game type adventures. No it is nothingoscar worthy or a breakthrough in film making. But it is a fun all around good time. Go to the theater grab some popcorn and just set back and enjoy.","Tomb Raider",9974,2.7,-0.8
"9975",4,"  Excellent movie. It has Action, Adventure, Mythology, Magic/Mystery, Puzzles. It's not perfect, at the beginning it has a pretty funny & silly plot but after the first act it rises surprisingly. The best film after Indiana Jones (it's not a comedy like the other movies of this genre, this one is really dark & serious). Photography & Landscape are beautiful. OST is great & immerse you in this fascinating world. I want to watch a second part now. I am really excited.","Tomb Raider",9975,2.7,-1.3
"9976",4,"  Was a really good action movie. I think it could have developed the characters a bit more, but for what it was I liked it.","Tomb Raider",9976,2.7,-1.3

"9981",2.5,"  my major problem with this movie was when she decided to help the bad guys for no particular reason against all advice from her father that would result in the end of the world... where is the motivation in movies these days? its like they dont bother any more. felt like game fan service but i did appreciate the first blood feel it had at very few points, wish they had kept that theme going. i think the film could have benefited from showing the grueling pain and incessant punishment against the odds, like the games. (kinda like how die hard did it). less puzzles and myths and a bit more brutal death defying imo.","Tomb Raider",9981,2.7,0.2

"9983",5,"  I haven't played the games and I didn't see it with Angelina Jolie because it had Angelina Jolie in it, but the trailer looked fun so I went. I was pleasantly surprised. I was reminded of the excitement of Indiana Jones. I hope they make a sequel, but not try and follow the game.","Tomb Raider",9983,2.7,-2.3
"9984",4,"  Solid adventure movie, didn't expect too much and it might have exceeded my expectations a little bit. Sheri mentioned she thought Lara Croft was a bit wimpy.","Tomb Raider",9984,2.7,-1.3
"9985",2.5,"  Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft works brilliantly, But the story suffers from many plotholes and too many unexplored storylines. Yes, it does stick to the video game, and it does a good job at that, but the movie also ewokes zero emotion and no investment.","Tomb Raider",9985,2.7,0.2
"9986",2.5,"  Poor story, poor writing, only thing that rescues this film is good action scenes.","Tomb Raider",9986,2.7,0.2
"9987",3,"  This is a much grittier and realistic portrayal of the Tomb Raider franchise. No campy hero poses or expressions, and the first scene shows Lara getting owned in a boxing match. I found myself enjoying it as a pure action/drama piece, and forgetting it was even based on a video game. My only issue is that I just can get behind Alicia Vikander being Lara Croft for purely superficial reasons. I don't think she has the right look, and I'm not talking about her cup size. Lara is supposed to be stunningly beautiful, and Alicia just seems kind of ""dopey"" looking and short. I much would've preferred Keira Knightley, or someone who can hold an elegant beauty regardless of camera angle. Sorry to sound cruel, but as someone who was playing Tomb Raider back in the late 90s, I remember when Rhona Mitra was the first Tomb Raider live action model, and hoped to see someone of that caliber.","Tomb Raider",9987,2.7,-0.3
"9988",4,"  It's narrative is by no means groundbreaking, but Vikander is simply breathtaking in the role - a performance that brings vulnerability and determination to the screen with such ease. Recommended for fans.","Tomb Raider",9988,2.7,-1.3
"9989",4,"  The new origin story may not be up to much, but Alicia Vikander proves that you don't need giant breasts to be a fantastic Lara Croft. Vikander makes the character believable and personable, despite Lara's new attitude to her wealth. Fear not though, as by the end of the film we find her ready to take on both her heritage and her new destiny. This sets up the new series of films and is hampered by its very nature as an origin story, but as a launching point into future stories it is just what fans of Tomb Raider need.","Tomb Raider",9989,2.7,-1.3
"9990",4,"  Really enjoyed the movie - at first I didn't want to see after I checked out the reviews but after seeing it I'm glad I didn't boycott Tomb Raider.","Tomb Raider",9990,2.7,-1.3
"9991",3,"  Alicia Vikander surprised me, what can you not do? Stealing every scene, she's beyond fierce and brave. The supporting cast was good, and it was an escape from reality. Was it as good as Tomb Raider with Angelina Jolie? No. Is it along the lines in subject and theme as Raiders of the Lost Ark? Yes. But in no way compares. [3.0 stars]","Tomb Raider",9991,2.7,-0.3
"9992",4.5,"  Fun action flick. Definitely an improvement over the originals. I really like the new Lara. Hope we get some more in the series.","Tomb Raider",9992,2.7,-1.8

"9996",5,"  Enjoyed every second of this film, a few refrences to the games, a nod to indiana jones, an all out adventure! Sure it could be better as it was a tad predictable, but non-the less I loved it, Would recommend.","Tomb Raider",9996,2.7,-2.3
"9997",4.5,"  I don't know what's wrong with these critics. This movie certainly does NOT deserve to be lumped into the ""splat"" category. I've played both of the newest reboot games, While it doesn't quite meet the true essence of the games, how could it anyway? you would be trying to fit at least 48 hours of game-play into a 2 hour movie. It does have a promising story line, pretty decent special effects, and keeps you wanting more. I have seen a LOT more badly presented video game movies then this. It's also important to note that I have seen a lot of poor biased comments made to reflect the entire movie based alone on the appearance of the actress playing Lara (Alicia Vikander.) If that is your only hang up, don't review movies, you obviously don't know what you are doing. And it is a pretty immature basis for a rating an entire movie. The movie is based on Lara's origins, even the 2010 PC game portrays Lara as an age that could be classed as pre-adult. The audience rating of 70% is the correct rating. 49% and a splat is an insult. IMDB has a better class of rating. I'm actually quite disappointed that Rotten Tomatoes is so corrupt in it's reviews. I am a long time user of this site as a guide in choosing quality movies. And this movie makes me wonder what hidden gems of movies I've missed in the past. If you're trying to figure out weather you should watch this movie or not. DO IT! It's worth the money. I would pay to see it again.","Tomb Raider",9997,2.7,-1.8
"9998",2.5,"  Just been to see Tomb Raider or as will ever be known as Lara Croft and the Last Crusade as it has the EXACT same plot as the 3rd Indy movie. Father goes missing? Check. Father leaves behind diary leading to a McGuffin? Check. And that's not all but to say anything else would be giving away spoilers. It's not terrible. And Vikander holds the film together. The action scenes are ok and do feel like scenes from a video games. Although at times they were either poorly edited or it's too dark to see what's going on (that might have been due to the 3D we saw it in). It does try desperately to set up a sequel at the end but I have a feeling this will be Vikander's only outing.","Tomb Raider",9998,2.7,0.2
"9999",2,"  a popcorn movie. I was wondering that why Croft so strong? She not even die when she was falling from the rock to river","Tomb Raider",9999,2.7,0.7
"10000",3,"  un bon film d'aventures et alicia vikander tient bien le role .","Tomb Raider",10000,2.7,-0.3
"10001",3,"  I found this movie fun, our heroine is meant o be smart however but keeps making odd decisions that suggest she is dumb, a better story would have fixed that.The acting was OK and Vikander worked.The main mistake though is badly executed continual jeopardy for some scenes, you will have seen the scene from the trailer where she runs along the rusted plan wing on a waterfall? Well, its part of a long, long, action sequence and eventually you stop caring, the tension is lost and you just want to move onto the next scene.In fact you can almost hear the changes in the script being discussed in your head, ""she is winning this fight at the moment, lets inexplicably turn that around to keep the tension up even though it will feel unlikely and the guy she is fighting should be in shock by now, the audience will really appreciate the extra tension""Also their is a line by her bike courier colleague early on about her character quoting Shakespeare, so why would she possibly be a bike courier, the obvious problem with this is this other character is a bike courier and knows Shakespeare, very odd choice really, because its those little things building up that stop people getting into the film, despite the professional critics coming up with other explanations, that's the stuff that takes you out of it.","Tomb Raider",10001,2.7,-0.3
"10002",5,"  Really enjoyed it. Alicia was fantastic as Lara Croft. The film was very true to the games. The reviews dont seem to fairly reflect the film IMO.","Tomb Raider",10002,2.7,-2.3
"10003",1,"  If you want a campy adventure movie, watch Raiders of the Lost Ark. If you want banter between an adventurer and his tough-as-nails offspring, watch Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. If you want a special effects fueled origin story, watch one of the many Marvel movies. If you want a hamfisted, obvious plot twist intended purely to set up a sequel, watch any teen thriller. If you want a pointless Cornetto Trilogy cameo, watch Force Awakens.If you want a sad, uninspired, and poorly acted mishmash of all the above, or if you want to completely waste your time and money for some masochistic reason, watch Tomb Raider.","Tomb Raider",10003,2.7,1.7
"10004",4.5,"  As an avid fan of the Tomb Raider franchise I had very strict, and admittedly biased, expectations for the newest Tomb Raider film. To my incredible delight, the film was nowhere near a disappointment, hitting every note flawlessly! From the very onset Vikander comes across as the perfect updated version of Lara Croft. Her performance of the eponymous character is one I hope to see in many more sequels down the road. The story flowed quite nicely keeping the main characters to a minimum really helped me to connect to them each on a small level all without distracting from the excitement on screen. Beyond the fact that the first game I ever played on the Sony Playstation was the first Tomb Raider game, way back when, I found myself really routing for Lara and at times even being concerned for her; after all who among us that played 2013's Tomb Raider reboot can forget the many visceral ways that Lara can be injured and even killed?Tomb Raider is a visually stunning picture that displays a wide color palate that never comes across as anything beyond what we see on a day to day basis. Roar Uthaug knew exactly how this film should be made and the direction was on point. While hitting all the highlights from the aforementioned 2013 reboot of the game franchise, the film has a very grounded feel that makes you think ""this isn't as far fetched as it sounds"" while keeping the adventure and puzzle solving essence of the Tomb Raider games firmly in place. In conclusion, I absolutely adored Tomb Raider and will be going to see it again this weekend for a matinee. 4.5 stars. Go see it, and bring a friend!Lessons learned: Reclaim your items from the local pawnbroker.Inspired ideas: Fox hunting. ;)","Tomb Raider",10004,2.7,-1.8

"10006",4,"  Alicia Vikander is amazing. She commited so much physically to this role and it shows. Most games adapted from videogames fall flat on their faces and either try too hard or not hard enough. Tomb Raider was both enjoyable and exciting to watch. I would love to see Vikander back again in the role and kicking more asses. From a filmmaker stand point it was entertaining and well created. I cared about the characters and their motivations. Set design was great. And they really captured the essence of the newest games. Overall; the movie was a fun ride. Kept me wondering what would happen next. And for the cherry on top it is the amazing Alicia Vikander in the role. What else could you ask for?The ONLY reason this isn't a 4.5 or maybe even a 5 to me is because I think it would be best as an R rated film. Lets get gritty people!","Tomb Raider",10006,2.7,-1.3
"10007",1.5,"  Terrible Movie. The best part about it was how laughable it was. Even with movie pass I regret seeing it. Bad story. Bad directing. Basically just a movie showing how well this girl is at taking falls and holding on to things.","Tomb Raider",10007,2.7,1.2
"10008",3,"  Surprisingly decent reboot. Enjoyed it more than the original. Alicia is a better Lara than Angelina.","Tomb Raider",10008,2.7,-0.3
"10009",3.5,"  This is Best movies from video games 7/10 Drama isn't good , But action scences is good.","Tomb Raider",10009,2.7,-0.8
"10010",4,"  They took a video game and adapted it to the big screen. That's hard to do, period. That being said, I personally thought it wasn't bad. I liked it. I wouldn't say it was the most amazing movie i have ever seen, but gosh Laura is one heck of a woman! The woman power in this movie was incredible. Loved it. Based off a video game or not, any woman who can outrun a bunch of male bike riders, and fight off a bunch of men with guns armed with a bow and arrow deserves my respect. Positive role model in a B movie. Thumbs up!","Tomb Raider",10010,2.7,-1.3
"10011",4.5,"  Fun film that pays tribute to the game.","Tomb Raider",10011,2.7,-1.8
"10012",5,"  Fun action-adventure movie that should have been better rated by the critics. The audience has it right here, it's a solid 70%.","Tomb Raider",10012,2.7,-2.3
"10013",3.5,"  Shows that critics are out of touch with audiences when they give something like this with a largely heartfelt story and a lead you can care about that kind of rating and something with terrible characters like the Last Jedi so so much more.I bet audience score for this one stays around the 70-75 it has now, It's not perfect, but it is only let down a little in the pacing and execution. Touches here and there and it would be really great. Splash more colour in the palette, some snappier dialogue, slightly deeper plot. I hope she gets a second outing to try to get the character somewhere really special.","Tomb Raider",10013,2.7,-0.8
"10014",5,"  Fun movie, enjoyable with the family","Tomb Raider",10014,2.7,-2.3

"10016",1,"  This is not an action-adventure movie, it is more in line with a drama movie and slow to start.","Tomb Raider",10016,2.7,1.7
"10017",4,"  Good fantastic movie starring Alicia Vikander, Walton Goggins and nick frost. I watched the original tomb raider movies with Angelina jolie and they for me set the bar for video game movies but now we have a new tomb raider movie and it just raised the bar higher because tomb raider is the best video game movie ever. I can't wait to watch it again and when watching the trailer I knew that this movie would be great and it is. Yes this movie has a ton of flaws but in the end Alicia Vikander is a better laura croft than Angelina jolie.","Tomb Raider",10017,2.7,-1.3
"10018",5,"  It was truly amazing and such a good film. this should have way higher ratings.","Tomb Raider",10018,2.7,-2.3
"10019",3.5,"  Overall the Tomb raider has a great performance from Vikander, some good action and character moments, perhaps underrated fight scenes, a capable supporting cast, and a decent concept, with underwhelming dialogue and underdeveloped plot, a couple inconsistencies and some less than preferable choices. This isn't a great movie by any means, but I believe it has enough good elements that its worth checking out. Especially if you are a fan of the newer games, action movies, or can look past smaller problems, you should have a good time.","Tomb Raider",10019,2.7,-0.8
"10020",1,"  Absolutely god awful crap....It's pretty sad what the studios pump out and ask us the audience to pay the same ticket price for this rubbish and say a great film like 3 Billboards....I walked out 1/2 way through.....It's a shame they had to give this gal who played Lara complete garbage to work with","Tomb Raider",10020,2.7,1.7
"10021",4,"  Finally a video game based movie that doesn't suck! Alicia Vikander was a great Lara Croft, lots of action and Walton Goggins was great too.Took my 12 year old granddaughter, she loved it. We went home and she dug out my copy of the remastered PS4 Tomb Raider game and played it for almost 3 hours!If you are a fan of the games then you will most likely enjoy the movie.","Tomb Raider",10021,2.7,-1.3
"10022",0.5,"  I knew what would happen after every moment.","Tomb Raider",10022,2.7,2.2
"10023",5,"  Great adaptation of the game storyline to the silver screen. The actress did a fantastic job getting ready for the part of Lara Croft in making her actions in the movie believable. Edge of the seat action that is a great start for a nice series of movies to come. Excellent film!","Tomb Raider",10023,2.7,-2.3
"10024",3,"  The movie industry continues it's run of dodgy video game adaptations with their latest incarnation of Tomb Raider, this time with Miss Croft's action boots filled by Alicia Vikander. An excellent actress in her own right, AV is easily the best thing about the film. She plays it completely different from how Miss Jolie did back at the turn of the millennium, due to this outing being based on the 2013 videos game rather than the series from the 90s. I haven't played any of the recent ones, and so had no way to compare it, but there's a fair share of both high and low points. The acting is good, the story is not. The action can be enjoyable, the editing never is. Many of the scenes of running and fighting are shot so poorly and edited so choppily that you'll swear you're watching a Michael Bay movie. I appreciate the fact that there's no attempt to oversexualise Lara, and she can just be a likable lead without having to pander to drooling teens, but she's often relegated to the status of a side character, with the supporting cast given more of a central role than she ever is. It's got a pretty good climax, and the surprise towards the end caught me off guard, but too much of the plot is convoluted and doesn't add up to a great deal. I'd watch it again if given the chance, and certainly wouldn't write it off as worthless junk. It just feels like a lot of talent has been underutilised, and the resulting product should have been so much more than it turned out to be.","Tomb Raider",10024,2.7,-0.3
"10025",5,"  Great special effects and storyline. Perfect actress for the role. I'd say it's better than the game!!","Tomb Raider",10025,2.7,-2.3
"10026",5,"  I liked this better than Black Panther, and I liked Black Panther.","Tomb Raider",10026,2.7,-2.3
"10027",5,"  Anxiety was high throughout the whole movie.... LOVED IT.","Tomb Raider",10027,2.7,-2.3
"10028",3,"  It followed the 2013 remake of the game, but only its plot. It didn't follow much of anything else. For me, it's not a bad game, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype.","Tomb Raider",10028,2.7,-0.3
"10029",5,"  Everyone has their own opinion on what is good that's why we never listen to critics. I go to a movie to be entertained whether it be action, drama, Sci-fi. If the movie keeps me in my seat It is worthy. Alicia and the cast kept me in my seat for a fun ride. A great choice to reboot the franchise.","Tomb Raider",10029,2.7,-2.3
"10030",5,"  Wasn't sure what to expect but I loved Alicia Vikander as the young Lara Croft. I don't play video games so can't speak to that but I do go to an occasional movie. I enjoyed this much more than the panther movie. Panther was like watching a NY Broadway play. Lara Croft was much more gritty. Totally enjoyed.","Tomb Raider",10030,2.7,-2.3
"10031",2,"  Was it really necessary to re-boot the franchise this way? The plot is bad, acting regular and I missed sorely the action-packed rythm of the previous movies.","Tomb Raider",10031,2.7,0.7
"10032",2.5,"  It is a fine reboot. The story and action sequences could have been improved.","Tomb Raider",10032,2.7,0.2
"10033",2,"  angelina jolie is tomb raider,this is bullshit","Tomb Raider",10033,2.7,0.7
"10034",5,"  I walked in with low expectations and walked out really glad I saw this movie.","Tomb Raider",10034,2.7,-2.3
"10035",4,"  For someone who enjoyed the video games growing up. I believe they did a great job concidering cramming the game into a well timed movie. Video game movies usually turn out bad. Well I think this is the best one. Now I did have background knowledge of the character, but I took my sister to this movie. She hates video games and I only convinced her to come with me to see it is because she likes Indiana Jones. My sister is also also known for sleeping in a movie theatre if the film if boring and doesn't keep her interested. In her words she followed along well, she wasn't confused with the plot, there was a lot of action like an Indiana film and she stayed awake through the whole film.","Tomb Raider",10035,2.7,-1.3
"10036",4,"  Vikander played Croft with a self-assured confidence that bordered on arrogance (taking risks without hesitation, even when her life didn't depend on it), and it was probably the best part of the film. The story left something to be desired, but the interactions between characters were really enjoyable to watch. As a fan of the game, I thought the film really captured the essence of the puzzles and chase sequences that I loved to play as a kid. I think it delivered what it promised--a fun, action-filled adventure movie--and I would see a sequel, provided they put a little more thought into the story.","Tomb Raider",10036,2.7,-1.3
"10037",5,"  best video game adaption to date. I thought it was great","Tomb Raider",10037,2.7,-2.3

"10041",3.5,"  Alicia Vikander is believable as Lara Croft the story line is difficult because obviously they are trying to flesh out the character completely. Future Lara Croft films if there are more in the works with Alicia as the lead should very interesting because the building blocks have been placed already for the character. A good story line to entertain is all that is need now for future films.","Tomb Raider",10041,2.7,-0.8
"10042",5,"  Loved the movie. Was a great reboot to the series. Definitely the best video game movie to date. Cannot wait for the sequel","Tomb Raider",10042,2.7,-2.3
"10043",3,"  omb Raider es una película entretenida! No fue hecha para ganar un Oscar pero merece que la audiencia le dé una oportunidad y la valore por lo que es, una película y no un videojuego. Si usted la quiere calificar comparándola con cualquiera de las versiones que ha jugado, es muy probable que le de una calificación muy baja. Al verla aparte de cualquier otra presentación, la encuentro aceptable y espero que reciba la oportunidad de una secuela. Me muero de ganas por ver lo que hacen con Alicia Vikander en el futuro. En mi opinión, esta es mucho mejor que las películas que vimos en el 2001 y en el 2003.","Tomb Raider",10043,2.7,-0.3

"10045",3.5,"  I thoroughly ejoyed the movie. Lara was played by a better actress than Jolie was. The story was pretty good. It reminded me more of the video game action, which of course its based on.","Tomb Raider",10045,2.7,-0.8
"10046",5,"  Great delivery! Not a single moment was devoted to boredom. Cannot wait for the sequel. People, you can ignore the tomatometer and the top critics on this one, they can stay home and solve puzzles instead, may be they will get happiness that way. Follow the audience score!!","Tomb Raider",10046,2.7,-2.3
"10047",3.5,"  I wasn't expecting it to be this good. But it had interesting story concept and a lot of ""indiana jones"" like action. Actress was believable too and you cared about the characters.","Tomb Raider",10047,2.7,-0.8

"10050",3,"  It was fun. and reminded me of the original Mummy movies with Brendan Fraser. While I won't say it's a movie I'll come back to, or put in nay must watch list. I felt it was a faithful and good adaptation of the more recent games. I would definitely catch any sequels.","Tomb Raider",10050,2.7,-0.3
"10051",4,"  If you are a fan of the game, you'll lve this movie!","Tomb Raider",10051,2.7,-1.3
"10052",4,"  The movie was a joy to watch. Alicia did a great a job with the role. The shooting was pretty nice i liked the way they made Lara ""human"" making her a person like everybody else, you can clearly see this in the opening boxe scene and when she was robbed in japan. The story line could've been better. All sumed up, a greate movie and a great reboot to the franchise.","Tomb Raider",10052,2.7,-1.3
"10053",1,"  Boring and predictable...cheesy and I like the actress in other films but she is whiny the whole film and lacks chemistry with the characters and plot after she goes off on her adventure.","Tomb Raider",10053,2.7,1.7
"10054",4,"  Watching this was a lot of fun. It's also grueling. Lara is so tough and clever-nobody is on her level-and Vikander is incredibly charismatic as the lead. She owns the part. I want to see it again.","Tomb Raider",10054,2.7,-1.3
"10055",5,"  So much better than the first two Lara Croft Movies","Tomb Raider",10055,2.7,-2.3
"10056",5,"  In my opinion Tombraider FINALLY break the videogame curse by actually being an amazing movie. Fans of the latest games will be blown away with how much sincere passion was put into bringing Lara to the screen. In an era of amazing comicbook adaptions it's about time videogames shared in the glory, and I feel Tombraider ushers in that era.","Tomb Raider",10056,2.7,-2.3
"10057",2,"  Ugh, I don't know why, but I really hated this movie! The acting was okay, but some of the action scenes are disjointed and hard to follow or believe. I just thought the whole thing was ridiculous.","Tomb Raider",10057,2.7,0.7
"10058",5,"  This movie is amazing. It's got everything: interesting plot, amazing characterization and it was a great adaptation of the video game. Alicia Vikander played an amazing Lara Croft who's just beginning to find out what her father worked for and where he could possibly be. There's no unnecessary love story, once the love Lara has for her father is the only thing to care about. It clearly shows that a woman is up for any task and she delivers well. Lara's brain and abilities are the focus of this movie and it's an inspiration for every single young woman to follow. I 100% recommend this movie.","Tomb Raider",10058,2.7,-2.3
"10059",4,"  The movie is for the hard core LC gamers","Tomb Raider",10059,2.7,-1.3
"10060",5,"  WOW. As a person who's never played (Or been interested in playing) the tomb raider games, I came in with No idea of what to expect. I didn't even know Trinity's motives. And I came out with this in my mind: 11/10.","Tomb Raider",10060,2.7,-2.3
"10061",5,NA,"Tomb Raider",10061,2.7,-2.3
"10062",5,"  I am blown away. I hoped it would be half way decent, but let's be real, video game adaptations don't have the best track record. But Tomb Raider exceeded my expectations! It was REALLY good! This is a solid action adventure film in the vein of Indiana Jones meets National Treasure meets the Hunger Games. It's a fun time. You don't have to know anything about the character in order to enjoy it... but if you DO love the game series, you are in for a real treat. THIS is how you do VG adaptations.The acting is top notch and a big reason this film succeeds. Combine that with a fast pace, good world building, solid supporting characters, and the bravery to NOT jump the shark with the story... and you have a winning combo on your hands. Go see it! You will not be disappointed!","Tomb Raider",10062,2.7,-2.3
"10063",5,"  Great movie and adaptation from the video game. Alicia Vikander was a believable hero and played the part perfectly.","Tomb Raider",10063,2.7,-2.3

"10066",2.5,"  The whole plot of meaningless.","Tomb Raider",10066,2.7,0.2
"10067",5,"  I thought it was a pretty good movie. The story was darker and deeper than the previous Tomb Raider movies. Vikander appears to be more like the game character from the recent games than Jolie did with the previous incarnation. I like that this depicts how she became the Tomb Raider rather than just picking up after she is established. For someone not familiar with the games, this would be more realistic for them.","Tomb Raider",10067,2.7,-2.3
"10068",4.5,"  If you are a fan of the video game you will appreciate this movie.","Tomb Raider",10068,2.7,-1.8

"10070",4.5,"  Much better than expected. Great movie coming from the 2013 game. You shouldn't compare it to the Angelina Jolie movies tho. See it as a new beginning.","Tomb Raider",10070,2.7,-1.8
"10071",5,"  Amazing movie just like in the Game! Don't know why got score so low like this . Really really worth to see! I love it!","Tomb Raider",10071,2.7,-2.3
"10072",5,"  Very entertaining with very little language and no sexual overtones or crudity. It has suspenseful action scenes and some graphic violence.","Tomb Raider",10072,2.7,-2.3
"10073",3,"  For a long time now Hollywood has been struggling to answer the age old question, ""Is it possible to make an honest to God, good movie based on a video game?"" Tomb Raider answers this question with a resounding - sort of. The good news is: this is easily the best ""Movie based on a Video Game"" ever made. The bad news is: all that really means is, it's better than Prince of Persia. I'll be honest, I had serious doubts about Alicia Vikander as an action hero. However I am happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong. Whereas Jolie's Lara Croft was essentially an impression of Roger Moore at his campiest, Vikander's Lara Croft is a straight up badass in the tradition of Sarah Connor. Her performance is the engine that drives this film and keeps you invested when things inevitably get pretty silly. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug (who directed the fantastic Cold Prey) does a solid job with the action and set-pieces, and keeps things moving just fast enough to keep you from thinking to hard about the actual plot, which owes more than a little to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This is clearly meant as a Casino Royale/Batman Begins of sorts for the franchise, but lets be clear: at the end of the day all Tomb Raider is aiming to be is a fun, action adventure, B-movie in the vein of Indiana Jones. If any of that sounds bad to you, well you should probably avoid this movie. But if not, there's some fun to be had here.","Tomb Raider",10073,2.7,-0.3
"10074",5,"  Highly recommend it to anyone who likes action-adventute movies. Alicia was a great Lara","Tomb Raider",10074,2.7,-2.3
"10075",3,"  Solid action flick.I'm surprised this film got a lot of weak reviews from professional reviewers.Script made sense and kept me interested. Fun action sequences. They tried some neat new things here: an action sequence involving a ladder, a tomb trap, and the revelation of the what the prize they're searching.Vikander and the rest of the cast all do a good job. (Surprised they got Derek Jacobi for a minor role that anyone could have played.) I heard complaints that Walton Goggins didn't play a more magnetic antagonist like he did in any films. However, I think this spoke to his ranger. I though it was a nice change of pace to play a nasty, desperate man who attempts to put on a thin veil of normalcy.Camerawork was interesting. They went with a Daniel Craig-James Bond shaky-cam/psuedo documentary feel to it which I felt made the film feel more grounded than some action movies without making the film feel like it was trying too hard to be realistic. The nighttime and cave scenes were too dark, though.","Tomb Raider",10075,2.7,-0.3
"10076",5,"  Awesome movie, Alicia plays a true to the reboot video game Lara. Can't wait to the future sequels","Tomb Raider",10076,2.7,-2.3

"10079",4,"  it's been over 20 years since the Tomb Raider games made their mark on pop cultureafter 2 films and a rebooted version for the next generation of players Lara Croft makes her way back to the big screen in a whole new wayAlicia Vikander takes on the iconic role but starting with her origin story before becoming the infamous Tomb Raider the filmmakers borrow a lot of elements from the 2013 version of the games and it's truly rooted more in a rougher, grittier, more real-world settingLara's father has gone missing after 7 years looking for a magic empress named Himiko on an island called Yamatai, he also left his research found by a militant group called Trinity seeking to control all humankindat first Lara wants nothing to do with her inheritance but after finding a clue about his discovery she believes he may still be aliveshe then charters a course to find the island in the middle of the ocean and is captured by a man named Mathias Vogel who wants to find the tomb to get back home but unleashing something deadly in the processLara then finds out the danger her father was put in to conceal it from TrinityVikander commands the screen playing Lara Croft; she's tough, strong, resilient, and can take a beating in any shape or form whether jumping from a crashed plane or learning to take up archery Dominic West expertly plays her father always thinking of her despite the fact that he left to keep her safe and she just wants him to come homeWalter Goggins as Mathias believes he's not doing any harm to the world but only to find this tomb so he can make it back, he's also very dismissive of the line between reality and myth, he's a decent enough antagonistthe film has some very intense action scenes, picks up the pace after the first half, and could ultimately create a new franchise if the filmmakers play their cards rightAngelina Jolie kept up the adventurous, sex-symbol image of Lara at the time but with Vikander Tomb Raider can now be this action heroine for young boys and girls braving the elements while valuing the family ones, toothis is a true sign of hope as far as video game-to-film adaptations golet's pray they can keep it that way","Tomb Raider",10079,2.7,-1.3

"10081",5,"  Giving lara a origin story was so amazing! This is one of the best movies to come onto the silver screen in 2018! Alicia is amazing! Lara is a kickass super star! I seriously can't wait to see what adventures lara will go on next!!","Tomb Raider",10081,2.7,-2.3
"10082",1,"  Disappointed, was expecting a strong badass sexy independent woman, not a wimpy posh girl who didn't make any of it believable or interesting. The trailers made it look like a decent tomb raider film but it It was very slow and boring and nothing like the video games I preferred the Angelia films,Waste of time and money","Tomb Raider",10082,2.7,1.7
"10083",5,"  I enjoyed this film a great deal, a fun and intense adventure film that channels Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade better than any adventure film has since its release. The fact that critics were mixed shows how far why've fallen down the rabbit holes of their own self-importance. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed.","Tomb Raider",10083,2.7,-2.3
"10084",5,"  i think it was nearly a perfect videogame adaptation.","Tomb Raider",10084,2.7,-2.3
"10085",4,"  Exactlty the strong female lead we've been waiting for - strong, smart and human. Best part - unlike Ghostbusters its not at the cost of making men seem like duntzes and unlike star wars she's not a Mary sue. Which is probably why critics arent as gung-ho for it. Their bad, though; I think its great to see a woman being the strongest character on the screen amongst strong men and a positive father figure.On top of that its a lot of fun - some major pacing issues which can make it seem slow. But still, I enjoyed it; makes me want to play the new games again.","Tomb Raider",10085,2.7,-1.3
"10086",5,"  I loved the concept of this movie, the movie is exactly like the video game and Alicia Vikander was so bad a**. It was so welly written and so I'll give this 5 out of 5.","Tomb Raider",10086,2.7,-2.3
"10087",1,"  Millions of $ for Special Effects with a nickel plot line.","Tomb Raider",10087,2.7,1.7
"10088",1.5,"  How can you shoot a movie that is based on a game title and manage to mess up the amazing storyline that's already there for you? People, if you want to see the actual story just play the 2013 Tomb Raider title. Kudos to Vikander though for portraying a version of Lara Croft that's almost identical to the one found in the new Tomb Raider games.","Tomb Raider",10088,2.7,1.2
"10089",5,"  Really loved this movie.. based on the 2013 tomb raider game. It has a lot of easter eggs to the game, the plot was interesting and kept me entertain around the hole movie. I really hope we get a sequel","Tomb Raider",10089,2.7,-2.3

"10091",5,"  Absolutely loved it. I'm a Tomb Rider fan, and I was nervous after watching the promos, that they were going to ruin it, but I went because I'm a fan. Well, I was not disappointed. Alicia Vikander brought the spunk, grit, and down right stubbornness you would expect from a young Lara Croft. Most of all, the casting choices were well made. The action and fight scenes felt real to me (save for one crazy ""tomb raider"" jump near the end. I was very pleased with this movie... I'll buy it and watch it again.","Tomb Raider",10091,2.7,-2.3
"10092",5,"  Great Movie. Action packed fun with a great story.","Tomb Raider",10092,2.7,-2.3
"10093",3.5,"  I really liked this movie, Vikander is a great choice for the new Laura Croft. I'm taking a star off for some lame writing, but the movie's fast pace and edge-of-seat tension blows past any rough patches. I loved the 2013 game and thought this movie matched that tone, so I imagine most folks that like the game will enjoy this movie. More to the point, my wife has never played any video games, but enjoyed this action adventure movie a lot as well.","Tomb Raider",10093,2.7,-0.8
"10094",4.5,"  Great movie. Not as campy as the Jolie films. Much more gritty and realistic. I love the scenes taken from the game reboots. And I was so excited to see the Nick Frost cameos. I should have known he might be in it and I'm guessing he will have a bigger role in the sequels. Thank you Alicia Vikander. You are wonderful.","Tomb Raider",10094,2.7,-1.8
"10095",3.5,"  Video game movies have had an increasingly bad rep since cinematic flopslike Warcraft and Assassin's Creed. While many people expected Tomb Raider to fall into a similar trap, I don't believe it does. Aside from having a boringish start in my opinion, after the island comes into play the story picks up signficantly with expensive action sequences and everything you would want Lara Croft to do. While it was not near perfect, it sets up a TombRaider franchise starring Alicia Vikander in the future, defeating her enemies.This not only will be very interesting as she grows more as an actress in thatcharacter, but also becomes more badass as the protagonist with a newattitude and weapons behind her portrayal. This was fun, and I am excitedto see where it goes. I am most excited however, due to the idea of a battlebetween the Uncharted film franchise and the Tomb Raider franchise. From avideogame perspective these have been compared for years, but with Sonyramping up to develop a Tom Holland-led feature film, I think the rivalry between the two could bring out the best in each other.","Tomb Raider",10095,2.7,-0.8

"10103",2.5,"  TOMB RAIDER feels more like the studio had to make the movie as a chore as opposed to wanted to make it and make it brilliant. The potential for TOMB RAIDER movies are as abundant and thrilling as Star Wars movies yet mediocrity appears to be the modus operandi on making game movies. It's a fun, no brainer movie that is heavily predictable and will be completely forgotten until the sequel. If they ever make one that is.Full review is now up on Salty Popcorn.","Tomb Raider",10103,2.7,0.2

"10107",5,"  Vikander's Lara Croft is the perfect blend of ass kicking action hero and relatable ""cool girl"". Her performance transcends the tangible lack of supporting character development and carries the film to a soaring, emotional, and heart pounding finale. Roar Uthaug's ""Tomb Raider"" is sure to be remembered as the first great video game anyone has ever seen.","Tomb Raider",10107,2.7,-2.3
"10108",1,"  Very boring up to 2/3rd of the movie, after that it's super predictable. Vikander is not believable as Lara Croft, it was clearly the wrong casting choice for a new franchise. Oh well, let's wait 10 years forthe next reboot.","Tomb Raider",10108,2.7,1.7
"10109",5,"  Amazing movie. Has a lot of action and just the right amount of suspense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more!","Tomb Raider",10109,2.7,-2.3
"10110",5,"  . I have just returned from watching the action-packed reboot of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise with Swedish actress Alicia Vikander in the title role and she is so extraordinary I was literally in awe of her for its almost two-hour runtime. Pre-publicity suggested that Lara Croft had been re-imagined, doing away with the sexy portrayal that the aforementioned Jolie had turned in, but I would claim that Vikander's brand of powerful athleticism is incredibly sexy. Sure, she's not shown in the tight-fitting outfits that Jolie pranced around her two movies in, but Vikander doesn't need them to be stunning, she has a poise and a grace that Jolie could never muster and when she turns on the heat the screen sizzles.The plot for what it is worth, concerns Vikander's Lara Croft seeking answers to the disappearance of her father several years earlier. He had ventured to an uncharted uninhabited island off Japan in the center of a particularly vicious sea in search of the tomb of a legendary Queen of Death. It seems a criminal organization known as Trinity is also hunting for the tomb and very soon Lara is off running through the desert, escaping certain death in several fist-clenching moments. I held my breath several times, feeling the director ratchet up the tension as I tried to figure out how Lara would survive the predicament. I had heard from earlier reviews that the movie had slow spots in it and I have to wonder if that reviewer saw the same movie as I. For shortly after a 'chase the fox' bicycle race in the streets of London and Lara is in Hong Kong racing after a trio of thieves before taking to the high seas in a raging storm. Full credit goes to Vikander who not only takes the action in her stride but is also able to pull off a very believable British accent. She balances the earnestness of her character's search with measured humor and humanity to bring dimension to a character that (since the origin is a popular video game) could have been wafer-thin. My favorite scene could quite possibly be a sequence that finds Lara hanging onto an old plane wing above a raging waterfall. Vikander is ably supported in her role by British actors Dominic West and Kristin Scott Thomas as Lara's missing father and her guardian respectively. Scott Thomas appears very briefly at the beginning and the end, though it is suggested she could have a larger role in any subsequent sequel. The villain of the piece is a suitably diabolical character named Mathias Vogel, a Trinity man-on-the-ground played with relish by Walton Goggins. Much of the humor is provided by sea captain Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu and his ""drunken sailor"" quip got a chuckle from the audience I saw the movie with.It's a foregone conclusion that I will want to see this movie again and again and I am hoping it gets a sequel because I can't wait to see Vikanders brand of action heroine in more fare. This movie comes highly recommended.","Tomb Raider",10110,2.7,-2.3
"10111",4.5,"  So got done watching the new Tomb Raider...Got to see pretty impressed with the film..Did this film brake the video game movie curse... Yes it very much did,Everyones performance was great but the stand out was Alicia Vikander as Lara croft her performance was like the character jump straight from The game.The film works as not only a tomb Raider film but if you take off the name of Tomb Raider and you are left with a great action adventure film.If you are a fan of the 2013 reboot series then you will enjoy this film.. Taking most of the iconic elements from that game and using them in a convincing way that not only serves the narrative but delivers a nice node to fans of the game8/10","Tomb Raider",10111,2.7,-1.8
"10112",5,"  One of the few good video game movies. It isn't really anything special per se, but it's a veeery enjoyable movie. I love Alicia as Lara, she truly feels like reboot lara, amd yet she beings her own things to the table. If you like action movies or the game reboot, go watch this.","Tomb Raider",10112,2.7,-2.3
"10113",5,"  As realistic as a fantasy action movie can be, Alicia brings ethos, fun, action, adventure and character to Lara Croft in this prequel that some critics are mistakenly thinking is a remake. Take your pre- and teen grand/daughters! (just two bad words)","Tomb Raider",10113,2.7,-2.3
"10114",4,"  I loved this film. If you can go see it at a Cineworld where it's showing in 4D I really would! Love that they've left it open for a sequel! A","Tomb Raider",10114,2.7,-1.3
"10115",3,"  I'm sorry but the trailer looked terrible. Bad CGI,shaky cam and I can't see Alicia as Lara (I'm a big fan of the game reboot and its sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider). For me, Angelina Jolie will always be Lara Croft.","Tomb Raider",10115,2.7,-0.3
"10116",4,"  A very rare good video game movie. Solid action, almost to the level of an Indiana Jones movie. Alicia Vikander does a fantastic job as Lara, wouldn't have chosen anyone else. Walter Goggins villian character is a paint-by-numbers villian, not much else to say about him. While not the most compelling story, I did enjoy where it took me and how everything tied together in the end. Hopefully they continue this franchise and give us some more stories with this character.","Tomb Raider",10116,2.7,-1.3
"10117",2.5,"  I'm not going to lie, the film seriously has rhythm problems, mainly in the development, and also is overshadowed by special effects of low quality, but it is certainly a breakthrough in videogame-based movies, locations, emotions and above all, Vikander, they raise this movie with great difficulty, which in my opinion could have been much worse, but in the same way, it could have been much better, let's hope that the predictable sequels are better.","Tomb Raider",10117,2.7,0.2
"10118",1,"  it was like Hunger games, Indiana Jones and the last Crusade, and The Goonies had a weird three way and produced a wimpy Lara Croft children's story.","Tomb Raider",10118,2.7,1.7
"10119",4,"  A wonderful origin story. Some of the scenes were pretty intense.","Tomb Raider",10119,2.7,-1.3
"10120",3,"  Alicia Vikander does a fine job of being an action hero. The action was good. The story line is very uninspired. We have see the tomb scenes done as well. At least with Indiana Jones they were fresh. Would probably watch a second but will not be sad it there is not another.","Tomb Raider",10120,2.7,-0.3
"10121",2.5,"  ***D-Box Review for Tomb Raider*** (DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON D-BOX!!!!!!!!) Must of been our night to hang out in Union Landing because everywhere we went was a bundle of joy...:-/ We have been to this theatre a ton of times and have spent a lot of money...my wife and I tried D-Box for the first time when Black Panther came out and enjoyed it. My wife even bought more tickets to take our nephew to enjoy the experience. My wife was hooked and bought it for Tomb Raider....it sucked...I forgot that we had even purchased D-Box for the seats because it only really worked 2 times throughout the movie...we paid that much for what? Should of called it D-Box-Sucks. We ended up getting someone to ask about this experience. Xavier the Assistant manager said the experience is on each individual and it may differ depending on the person..blah blah blah....we paid for a rocking chair...Xavier then went to speak with the Senior Manager Mike E. and he said there is nothing they can do for us...basically we got robbed....I asked how come there isn't some type of disclosure or anything staying how intense or whack the experience will be for that movie. Now that I'm done with this, time to contact corporate because although the movie was entertaining, we got robbed for D-Crap-Box...Xavier had advised me he doesn't buy D-Box-Sucks tickets...I wonder why...I wish I would of known that before we wasted our money on a squeaky chair.","Tomb Raider",10121,2.7,0.2
"10122",4,"  The movie is an overall great action flick. Those looking for deeper meaning may be a little underwhelmed. The game did a lot better job showing her development from innocent empowered woman to legendary badass, but the movie obviously had to cut down on some things. With all that said, it was an enjoyable movie and I would be opposed to seeing a sequel.","Tomb Raider",10122,2.7,-1.3
"10123",2.5,"  It was a pretty good watch. It was kind of predictable. I could have waited until it came on HBO.","Tomb Raider",10123,2.7,0.2

"10125",4,"  Movie goes very fast","Tomb Raider",10125,2.7,-1.3
"10126",1,"  Seemed like they tried to make a live action video game. Didn't like the character portrayal AT ALL! All that screechy screaming, she even says shit and mouths 'fuck' Her father seemed sooo pathetic. Lara's supposed to be deliberate and sultry, but she's running, running, running getting the crap beat out of her. The story is sooo lame. Hated it","Tomb Raider",10126,2.7,1.7
"10127",3.5,"  This was a better Indiana Jones movie than the actual last Indiana Jones movie. It was not as good as Raiders of course but still I was pleasantly surprised.","Tomb Raider",10127,2.7,-0.8

"10130",2.5,"  This film is better than the original Angelina Jolie ones,,, thats partly because Alicia Vikander is a more believable performer and is allowed to be more human and vulnerable than Jolie was... but also the storyline is slightly more grounded... It's not a great movie but its entertaining and thats whats important.","Tomb Raider",10130,2.7,0.2
"10131",4,"  Is a fresh face for the Tomb Raider and it was good departure from the ways it was done when Angelina Jolie was at the helm of the character , and honestly is was a impressive movie that had mix of a 007 movie with tidbits of mission impossible and Indiana Jones films , and hopefully we can get a sequel to expand on the character with a new actress","Tomb Raider",10131,2.7,-1.3
"10132",4,"  Tomb Raider's star Alicia Vikander goes all in, and is helped by a story that is surprisingly, almost as agile as she is. There is no glitz or glam here to elevate the film, and the audience can decide for themselves if that is a good thing or a bad thing. What Tomb Raider is sure to do is satisfy the masses with a blockbuster that for once has a story and protagonist that feel fully real and realized. The movie sports an admirable and diverse supporting cast, but they just can't compete with the star's incredible lead performance, not that they don't give it a nice try.","Tomb Raider",10132,2.7,-1.3
"10133",5,"  Absolutely fantastic film. Enjoyed this alot more than the yawn fest that was black panther. What are critics on these days.","Tomb Raider",10133,2.7,-2.3
"10134",5,"  This critic score is another example of why audiences shouldn't trust critics anymore. They gave their endorsement to Last Jedi, which was pretty terrible, and then they slap a 50% on this film, which in my opinion was very good. The action was great, the plot was enthralling, and there was nothing glaringly wrong with the movie. Really don't know why the critics were so upset by it. Highly recommend!","Tomb Raider",10134,2.7,-2.3
"10135",5,"  I enjoyed the film a lot! Filled with fun, edge-of-your-seat action scenes, an interesting and fresh take on Lara. Alicia killed it, she's always a delight to watch on screen and have this magnetism about her, you can't take your eyes of her!","Tomb Raider",10135,2.7,-2.3
"10136",4.5,"  Great reboot of the franchise! Following the star power of Jolie is tough enough, but Vikander's adaptation of the role as a young beginner is ""sooper"". She invested time, effort, acting on this movie and it showed! We love the cliff hangers, more natural. We like the plot, and that it took pieces from the game with more natural EFX!... nothing relevant here, but I felt watching this the second time - a feeling I didn't get from Star Wars The Last Jedi. That SW TLJ movie was dumb. This LC Tomb Raider by Vikander ROCKS!!! Kudos to the director for getting this right!","Tomb Raider",10136,2.7,-1.8
"10137",3.5,"  Tomb Raider is an enjoyable rebooted movie with some good adventure/action moments. There are lot of deja-vus and for me one the main one was Indiana Jones raiders of the lost ark. The special effects are sometimes good and sometimes ok. Overall fun!","Tomb Raider",10137,2.7,-0.8

"10140",5,"  The movie is actually decent, respect source material from video games, adding some plot twist that somehow managed better than the video games. Although, lacking of the ruins, myth or the feeling of ""Japan"" of Yamatai Island, and some confusing plots. The whole film is really well done with solid acting, solid action sequences, nice puzzles and the final tomb is good. I really love it. Great movie, great video game adaptation.","Tomb Raider",10140,2.7,-2.3

"10143",5,"  it was fantastic, i loved it, felt like I played a whole video game in a two hour slot,and lots of challenges from the first games in there. I loved how the movie didn't directly jump into the wild, starts off with life in London, and very happy with the fox race. It gives it more as a film. Very impressed with how they did it, think it'll open up the franchise to people who have never played it before too, just a great stand alone film, but also good for existing fans. very happy","Tomb Raider",10143,2.7,-2.3
"10144",3.5,"  Lara croft being one of the most famous women adventurers in gaming, highly sexualised with an urealistic body image for some men to drool over, and video game films flopping over the years with awful scripts and terrible likeness of the characters. The new 2018 Tomb Raider film was an absolute fun mix of plot, character development, action, adventure, puzzle solving and quite an intimidating villain which I had my doubts about but he actually pulled it off really well and made me feel quite uncomfortable as he was really menacing, especially how villains in a lot of films these days are quite forgettable and not worth mentioning. The most important part is Alicia as Lara croft, she owned the role particularly well, she's a young, fit and tough woman who showed a badass but humanised and grounded Lara croft and held her own until the very end of the film. The story was well written and held closely to the 2013 game reboot story and cinematography with changes here and there, but it was the Lara croft of the 1990s and that's all that matters as it's sticking to source material. If you're in this film for tits and ass, go home and rethink your life because this film is for intellectuals who can think with their upstairs brain. SEQUEL PLEASE!","Tomb Raider",10144,2.7,-0.8
"10145",4.5,"  A massive leap from the Angelina Jolie era of Tomb Raider, it is a must see movie regardless of reviews, this will satisfy gamers.","Tomb Raider",10145,2.7,-1.8
"10146",3.5,"  This movie is definitely an big improvement in the video game genre. It stayed as true as possible to the game it was based on. Alicia Vikander is for sure the stand out in this movie. And brings you a female badass, that has also a lot more humanity and depth to her then the previous Lara. She nails that role and I couldn't get enough of her. The Action and the CGI was fine too. The only big thing the movie was lacking is an inspiring and original story. It felt a little worn out. But all in all a big step in the right direction and a really enjoyable time at the theater.","Tomb Raider",10146,2.7,-0.8
"10147",4,"  Needed a less generic paint by the picture story and villain. Great effects, action sequences and a brutal effort by Alicia Vikander. Very true to the rebooted tomb raider games, and maybe a it too faithful.","Tomb Raider",10147,2.7,-1.3
"10148",5,"  Loved the games and loved the movie. Great action, drama, touch of comedy. Felt like a realistic adaptation. You don't have to have played the game and enjoy it.","Tomb Raider",10148,2.7,-2.3
"10149",4.5,"  Yay! I really liked it!Casting for the movie was perfect, Walton Goggins makes for the perfect villain. Alicia Vikander made a perfect Lara. Storyline was slightly different ( but a few on par stuff) from the game but not surprised as they have to cram a lot of storyline in a 2 hours movie. The end did set it up for way more storyline in future movies, so I'm stoked to see where it goes.Fantastic job on graphics, scenery and props matching the game.Really fun and worth seeing.","Tomb Raider",10149,2.7,-1.8

Gone is the over-sexualized Laura Croft of Jolie's run. Alicia Vikander is perfect. While she's beautiful, she proves that female action stars don't need to be oversexualized to be entertaining.As a fan of the video games, I was so pleased. The movie was written tightly, and Vikander shines as Laura. It's a treat that we see her develop over the course of the movie into the Tomb Raider, rather than crash onto the scene as such. I'm excited to see where the movie franchise goes. My only critiques are that I wish the tombs had been a little more detailed, and there needed to be more supernatural elements surrounding the tombs. I won't say more on the last, as spoilers would surely follow. All in all, a great franchise reboot.","Tomb Raider",10150,2.7,-2.3

"10152",1.5,"  all myths are foundations of reality..Tomb RaiderEven though there are stunning graphic visuals (all the water based sequences are beautifully shot), goosefleshing sound effects, brutal action sequences and jaw dropping stunts (hats off to the stuntmen) ironically the choreography; in a feature like this that relies a lot upon such stuff, is petty and questionable which at a certain point turns depressing rather than frustrating. At this stage of cinema, one would assume that the remake or the updated version of any feature or tale would be created with an aim to surpass the predecessor and fulfill the limitations (one is wrong). The premise never had enough potential to bedazzle the audience in the first place but in here the director Roar Uthaug is not even convincing the audience for a second look. Alicia Vikander, at the heart of it is so good and genuine throughout the course of it that it aches you to watch a talent go waste by. Tomb Raider has a shallow script that lacks gripping screenplay, better execution and editing (it ticks for around 2 hours which is way too much considering the material offered to the audience) to hold the audience on any loose thread of it.","Tomb Raider",10152,2.7,1.2
"10153",4,"  A fresh and welcomed return of Lara Croft to the big screen. The previous Tomb Raider/Lara Croft films seemed disjointed and slightly cartoonish. This time around, I believe we get a holistic look at who Lara Croft is and what drives her on.There is the occasional ?hiccup?, such as a nine year old tape recorder that plays without changing the batteries, but hey who carries spare batteries with them.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the revamped Tomb Raider. This film put meat on the bones of a franchise previously starved for ideas and has breathed life into the whole console game v?s big screen adaptation.Just wish someone somewhere would consider having a crack at the ?Uncharted? franchise. Seeing Nathan Drake on the big screen would be cool.Anyway, can?t wait to see the next instalment of Tomb Raider Mk 2","Tomb Raider",10153,2.7,-1.3
"10154",4,"  This is a really good movie. It sets up Lara Croft, beautifully crafts her as a normal day girl, Alicia Vikander only adds up to this beloved character, making her even more interesting and loveable. The action scenes are well put together, and different to what we are used to seeing in big screen spectacles, the action in this movie feels soulfull, with a heart pumping, they're powefull but then again simple. We can tell the C.G.I is there, but the built sets and the simplicity of the crafting of the action scenes take over any flaws. The father and daughter moments are touching and believable, it flows the story forward. I wish this movie had a better rating from critics, it truly makes me start thinking that it is purely prejudice against video game movies, as they all seem to bring the subject up, rather then just looking at the movie for what it is. A well acted, beautifully crafted and plotted action adventure, coming of age small flick, where not everything is perfect and shiny, but Alicia Vikander shines so bright like a diamond. Go see it...it's worth it.","Tomb Raider",10154,2.7,-1.3
"10155",5,"  Great film version of Tomb Raider. Alicia rocks as Lara Croft, and I would really like to see part 2! I hope this would become a start of a great franchise.","Tomb Raider",10155,2.7,-2.3
"10156",1,"  Being an enthusiastic fan of the Tomb Raider games, a movie that looked like it was pulled straight out of my favorite of the games had me nearly vibrating in anticipation. The trailers and teasers used scenes carefully chosen to mimic iconic 2013 Tomb Raider game moments, bursting with promises of an incredible live action debut of the fantastically written reboot of Lara Croft's story. The resulting movie, however, proved nothing more than a vast disappointment and a waste of two hours that would have served better in the game it was pretending to emulate.","Tomb Raider",10156,2.7,1.7
"10157",5,"  Amazing performance by Alicia i love the movie she is young Lara and not that powerful but smart and brave.Full with action and good story for a first movie i will watch it again","Tomb Raider",10157,2.7,-2.3
"10158",5,"  Definitelty recommanded! Alicia simply kills it as Lara Croft! Hope for a sequel!","Tomb Raider",10158,2.7,-2.3
"10159",5,"  Awesome Reboot! Loved it!","Tomb Raider",10159,2.7,-2.3
"10160",4,"  Much better than the previous films and quite enjoyable","Tomb Raider",10160,2.7,-1.3
"10161",5,"  Alicia Vikander delivered an emotional and convincing performance, paired with accurate and nostalgic action sequences, this movie is a must see, especially for any true Tomb Raider fan.","Tomb Raider",10161,2.7,-2.3
"10162",5,"  That was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed that, especially after the disappointments that were the first two movie. This one makes the originals look like some cheap high school production.Alicia was PERFECT, everything that Jolie wasn't. Nice to see an actual fit and athletic looking Lara Croft, AND one that can actually throw a punch and kick without making you cringe at the terrible technique.Loved this movie, can't wait to see it again.Alicia Vikander IS Lara Croft.","Tomb Raider",10162,2.7,-2.3
"10163",1.5,"  Oooof. With such an enormous budget, what happened?! The importance of story telling has never been more important in a film!Where do we start? A storyline that's a mess, a rediculous plot, unrealized characters, uninteresting dialogue, colorless cinematic pallet, extremely slow paced, and... wait for it... underdeveloped action scenes, tension building and weak performances. Yes, even award winning actors deliver stiff performances and lack the chemistry needed to make this tolerable to watch. Forgivable for a 10M film. Not 90M.","Tomb Raider",10163,2.7,1.2
"10164",4.5,"  WOW! This wasn't just a great video game film, it was a great action flick! Once you get past the bike chase scene the film takes off! Disappointed in the film industry to only score it 50% on here!","Tomb Raider",10164,2.7,-1.8
"10165",4,"  TOMB RAIDER entertains excellently through Alicia Vikander's powerful performance and fast, groundbreaking action in intricate, attentive depictions of the ocean and island even if the movie hardly has any plot written out and behaves very much like a live-action video game played out for you.","Tomb Raider",10165,2.7,-1.3
"10166",3.5,"  In 2013 square Enix did something smart -They realized the world is more aware and less naive, and realized a new version of Tomb Raider, a little more realistic and mature where the main character is brave but vernabl. A great original story.The movie creators made the same smart decision, following thia path and it pays off.The casting is the best achievement while Alicia is nothing less than fantastic and the story is intriguing, with solid action sequences.There are a few plot holes that prevent this picture beefing something really great, but still, its a fun ride to join.","Tomb Raider",10166,2.7,-0.8
"10167",3.5,"  Highly entertaining, action packed take on the Tomb Raider franchise. The actress playing the titular character did very well in the face of a fairly weak plot. That said, there have been FAR WORSE examples of films based on video games just in this franchise, let alone the whole video game movie genre. I ponied up for shake seats in the movie theater for this one and it did not disappoint. Brava, Lara Croft. 3.5 out of 5","Tomb Raider",10167,2.7,-0.8
"10168",3.5,NA,"Tomb Raider",10168,2.7,-0.8
"10169",2,"  You would enjoy Tomb Raider more if you lower your expectations and bring a controller. Every scene with Lara feels like a quick time event. Vikander was okay but the movie lacks a good story.","Tomb Raider",10169,2.7,0.7
"10170",4,"  Ok, I was really impressed how the kept true the overall tomb raider games (roboot series). During the a lot action scenes, I was screaming in my head ""push x!"" or ""oh shit, left trigger, right trigger!"" As far as the story, I wouldn't say it pulled my heart strings or saw anything unexpected but good overall. If your a fan of the series or looking for a good action movie, this is a good one.","Tomb Raider",10170,2.7,-1.3
"10171",5,"  I loved it good story and good acting can't wait till number 2","Tomb Raider",10171,2.7,-2.3
"10172",5,"  I love this movie definitely BEST Tomb Raider movie. It is also my favorite video game movie ever!!!","Tomb Raider",10172,2.7,-2.3
"10173",5,"  I loved it! Absolutely phenomenal! Alicia Vikander kills as the new Lara Croft! This movie totally captures the essence of the new Tomb Raider games as well as nods to the classics! I can't wait to see it again!","Tomb Raider",10173,2.7,-2.3
"10174",4.5,"  This is easily the best movie adaptation of a video game in recent years. Lots of good action and a solid story. It doesn't follow the 2013 story because that would require a lot of bad CGI, but it does have some of the iconic moments. This is a fresh and original reboot that's worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of the franchise.","Tomb Raider",10174,2.7,-1.8
"10175",5,"  Lara remains the bad ass she always has been. Just like the reboots of the games, it just has better graphics than the previous ones made. She seems less of a super here (compared to Angelina) to more of an extremely fit everday girl who has bravery and wits like no other. Loved it. Bring me more!","Tomb Raider",10175,2.7,-2.3
"10176",1,"  Way below my expectation","Tomb Raider",10176,2.7,1.7
"10177",4.5,"  I really like it,is a really good adventure movie and Alicia Vikander NAILED IT as Lara Croft","Tomb Raider",10177,2.7,-1.8
"10178",5,"  Disregard the TOMATOMETER, in this instance the audience score is far more telling. I've seen Tomb Raider several times now and I enjoy it more each time I see it. While it's not a perfect movie it is compelling and interesting. I think it's a shame that Rotten Tomatoes might discourage people from seeing this in theaters because it was truly a delight. If you are a fan of the games, you'll appreciate it all the better. But the beauty of this film is that you don't have to be a fan of the games to enjoy it. It stays true to the source material but doesn't forget that it's a movie and not a game, a mistake that many other adaptations have made in the past. I gave this movie 5 stars not because it was perfect but because it was enjoyable. And I think you'll enjoy it too if you get past the the TOMATOMETER and just experience it for yourself in theaters.","Tomb Raider",10178,2.7,-2.3
"10179",5,"  Enjoyed the movie far more than a 50% rating. Won't win an Oscar, but very entertaining. The only annoyance was the constant screaming. I am a Tomb Raider video game fan and she seemed whiny compared to Lara in the games. However, well worth seeing.","Tomb Raider",10179,2.7,-2.3
"10180",5,"  Love the action. It doesn't let up.. Great adventure a few good discoveries. What a great throw back to Indiana Jones!! What a ride.","Tomb Raider",10180,2.7,-2.3
"10181",4,"  From the preview I expected it to be exactly like the game it's based on. Turns out it's VERY loosely based on the game, and I mean very. That being said, it was still enjoyable and fun. I'll see the sequel if they make one for sure.","Tomb Raider",10181,2.7,-1.3
"10182",5,"  No shortage of action and great story telling in this big screen adaptation of the video game series Tomb Raider","Tomb Raider",10182,2.7,-2.3
"10183",4,"  Intense action/adventure film. Fan of Tomb Raider (the game) or not. It is amazingly entertaining.","Tomb Raider",10183,2.7,-1.3
"10184",5,"  I like this Tomb Raider reboot. The main character is much more likable then Angelina. Not sure why Critics are giving it bad reviews.","Tomb Raider",10184,2.7,-2.3
"10185",4,"  I enjoyed it quite a bit! As a fan of the video games, especially the most recent Rise of the Tomb Raider, I enjoyed Vikander's performance. I feel like she captured the grittiness of Lara Croft's character.","Tomb Raider",10185,2.7,-1.3
"10186",1,"  Spoiler Alert-this is poorly written. Laura Croft is supposed to be Smart and Athletic. They got this 1/2 right. She repeatedly makes dumb mistakes and is mentally weak! 4X she has the Villain Dead-to-rights and does NOTHING! She doesn't kill him when given the opportunity NUMEROUS times. She walks through his tent without him seeing her and she has a weapon. What does she do? Decides to go out looking for her buddy. WTH? She has an opportunity to push him over a cliff, into a cravats, off a platform, and shot him in the face. Does nothing...She leads the villain where he wants. Does what he wants. Seems to be more FOR him than against.Causes more problems and is down right foolish. This was excruciating to watch! Glad I didn't pay to see the 3D. It's a rental flick at best.","Tomb Raider",10186,2.7,1.7
"10187",3.5,"  Great fun, much like the last two games. Lara Croft and Alicia Vikander are badass! Can't wait for the next one, make it bigger and better please. This was a great start.","Tomb Raider",10187,2.7,-0.8
"10188",2.5,"  Good movie if you have never played the games.","Tomb Raider",10188,2.7,0.2
"10189",5,"  Good movie' nice history","Tomb Raider",10189,2.7,-2.3
"10190",5,"  I just saw it and enjoyed it a lot. A bit too fast but still enjoyable.","Tomb Raider",10190,2.7,-2.3
"10191",5,"  An action packed film, a plot worthy of the new Tomb Raider video games, Alicia captures the essence of Lara that we all know; a brave woman, intelligent but at the same time more human capable of making mistakes Definitely a film that no fan of Lara should miss!","Tomb Raider",10191,2.7,-2.3
"10192",4,"  I think this may be the best video game based movie that has come out in a while. It actually feels very much like Tomb Raider and Alicia vikander I feel portrays Lara Croft very well. I do feel that there were some opportunities missed and making her character a bit more well-rounded but overall I thought this was a very good movie. And it looks like the story going forward will be very exciting.","Tomb Raider",10192,2.7,-1.3
"10193",4,"  Tomb Raider was an enjoyable action movie with good effects and an interesting plot. Its dialogue was one of its only weaknesses, feeling slightly forced. Lara was grounded and relatable, however, almost every one of her decisions were reckless and stupid despite everyone telling her how smart she was. Overall, it was a good movie with mostly admirable qualities.","Tomb Raider",10193,2.7,-1.3
"10194",4.5,"  Being a fan of the game franchise it whisks you into the adventurous world of Laura Croft in the best way possible. The original adaptation was much more hollywood block buster while this feels like a simple ""indiana jones"" ish move. Much more grounded and although the world itself has to have unrealistic elements stays grounded in reality with the protagonist often getting hurt , disoriented, and tired. it knows what it is in terms of plot its simple but driven by the performance of Alicia Vikander. The villain kind of fell short in terms of depth but he still remained the dark part of the movie. Great fan service at the end, strong leading lady , and generally a fun movie.","Tomb Raider",10194,2.7,-1.8
"10195",3,"  Unnecessary, pointless, predictable and boring ... Alicia Vikander was great but this was rinse and repeat of the previous films ... not necessary a bad film but can't beat Indiana Jones ...","Tomb Raider",10195,2.7,-0.3
"10196",3.5,"  i WILL GO AS FAR TO SAY THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. NOT A GREAT MOVIE, BUT IT'S GOOD. ENJOYABLE TO SAY THE LEAST. i WILL ALSO SAY THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ANGELINA JOLIE VERSIONS, AND WHILE THIS MOVIE HAS SOME FLAWS, THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO THOSE. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY FEELS MORE LIKE THEY WANTED TO BUILD OFF THE TOMB RAIDER (2013) REMAKE OF THE GAMES, AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. IT HAD PLENTY OF ACTION, IT WAS FAST PACED (ALBEIT A BIT TOO FAST, BUT THAT'S REALLY JUST ME NITPICKING ON IT. SOME THINGS GO FAST BUT IF IT EXPLAINED MORE IT WOULD JUST ADD MORE TO THE OVERALL LENGTH OF THE FILM.)THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE IS VERY GENERIC. ALMOST LIKE THEY JUST DIDN'T TRY. FATHER GOES AWAY, SAYS HE WILL COME BACK, DOESN'T. DAUGHTER FOLLOWING IN THE ""FAMILY FOOTSTEPS"" SETS OFF TO FIND HIM. THEN STORY GOES FROM THERE. I DID LIKE THE ENDING THOUGH, LEFT OFF FOR A SEQUEL AND HAS A NICE TWIST. I DO LOVE ALICIA VIKANDER AS LARA CROFT. SHE PLAYS IT BEAUTIFULLY AND IS THE SAVING GRACE. HER CHARACTER WAS WELL DONE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HER CONTINUE THE ROLE.ALL IN ALL IT'S A SOLID MOVIE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO SEE IT, BUT FROM REDBOX OR USING A MOVIEPASS.","Tomb Raider",10196,2.7,-0.8
"10197",5,"  Probably the best video game film adaptation yet !! It is very faithful to the rebooted game with adding some of its own twists to it so its not exactly like the game. I've read critic reviews and I believe that they are misinterpreting the new Lara Croft, mostly because Lara is desexualized and is made more grounded. Regardless great movie with great pace, character development, emotional attachments, and great action seauences. Highly recommended.","Tomb Raider",10197,2.7,-2.3
"10198",4.5,"  An excellent piece of entertainment! I really enjoyed this remake. It's fast-paced, great action sequences, and Alicia Vikander, who plays Lara Croft, is outstanding. Vikander is one of my favourite actors and she brings a believability to her performance and makes the story more grounded than the originals. Norwegian Roar Uthaug direction is spot on. I've taken 1/2 a star off for the inevitable plot holes. But who really cares when it's such a joy to watch. Check it out on the big screen. Can't wait for the next one.","Tomb Raider",10198,2.7,-1.8
"10199",5,"  Fantastic Tomb Raider reboot that has Alicia as Lara Croft. She's beautiful and is a great actress. Plenty of action and entertaining.","Tomb Raider",10199,2.7,-2.3
"10200",4,"  classic studio film but Alicia as craft is awesome and it was an enjoyable time!","Tomb Raider",10200,2.7,-1.3
"10201",3.5,NA,"Tomb Raider",10201,2.7,-0.8
"10202",3.5,"  A good movie. Not bad, not great, but definitely enjoyable to watch.","Tomb Raider",10202,2.7,-0.8
"10203",3,"  La película de Tomb Raider (2018) no tenía mucho de tombs ni de raiders, pero aún así no fue un desastre. Fue disfrutable a pesar de no ser la gran cosa. Square Enix te odio. En fin, la película no creo que aburra a muchos, tiene acción, la Lara Crof está bastante decente, momentos entretenidos y algunos easter egg de los juegos que se disfrutan si eres fan de la saga (principalmente los dos últimos títulos). No creo que se le pueda pedir mucho más a una película de este estilo.Mi parte favorita fue el cameo de Nick Frost porque Nick es amor ?. Eso sí, probablemente la mejor adaptación de película a un videojuego, pero es re fácil, porque en general son todas basura.Tanto el juego Tomb Raider (2013) y el Rise of the Tomb Raider son superiores en todo aspecto. (JUEGAZOS ??)3/5.","Tomb Raider",10203,2.7,-0.3
"10204",0.5,"  A miserable parody of the Tomb Raider. Vikander is no Lara even a little. Don't waste your money for this piece of crap.","Tomb Raider",10204,2.7,2.2
"10205",4.5,"  Sometimes you can't trust movie critics. I feel the movie was very well done. Alicia Vikander was an excellent Lara Croft, giving even Angelina Jolie a run for a money. It was highly entertaining and kept my interest throughout. People complained about the lackluster origin story and true, it could have really been expanded and built upon,but overall the movie was great. I highly recommend it.","Tomb Raider",10205,2.7,-1.8
"10206",5,"  I like it and i will buy the blu ray and watch it again , Alicia is awesome in this role. A lot of action , good story and realy good performance , she is young and i love that she is not overpowered she fight and kill for the first time and she got hurt a lot too...... i hope for a trilogy :)","Tomb Raider",10206,2.7,-2.3
"10207",3.5,"  Tomb Raider has all the elements one wants from a good videogame movie:the action,the great visual effects,the referendes to the game but also a solid plot that entertains and makes you care about the main characters just enough to be invested in their action throughout the entire film. Alicia Vikander is just AWESOME and BADASS as Lara Croft and mamages to bring that emotional layer that Jolie's perfomance lacked. Showing Lara Croft as a tormented and unexperienced young woman, before she was the tomb raided everybody knows, was a smart move that made the audience create a stronger bond with her.All in all Tomb Raider is a very good movie and easily the best video game movie so far in my opinion. Hopefully this was just the first chapter of a long saga that may very well represent the long awaited rebirth of the videogame genre.","Tomb Raider",10207,2.7,-0.8
"10208",5,"  Awesome movie! It kept you on the edge of your seat from Beginning to end! Alicia Vikander was an amazing Lara Croft and I loved the Character Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu.","Tomb Raider",10208,2.7,-2.3
"10209",4,"  A lot of fun and if you've played the reboots you'll recognize moments from the game that'll make you smile. alicia vikander is a really awesome new lara. i absolutely loved her. if you're looking for another angelina jolie style lara this is not the movie for you. that's the lara for the original games, this is the lara for the reboot. both are great in different ways. it's not a perfect movie, but as a huge fan of the games, i really enjoyed it and i hope there's more down the road.","Tomb Raider",10209,2.7,-1.3
"10210",5,"  Fantastic movie. Gritty and realistic with really cool action scenes. Vikander was perfect as Lara.","Tomb Raider",10210,2.7,-2.3
"10211",4,"  alicia as lara croft was somewhat ok still perfer angelina jolie version","Tomb Raider",10211,2.7,-1.3
"10212",3,"  A grounded reboot, based on the 2013 video game. Though extremely generic, this is a fun action flick and a faithful adaption of the game. Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, she is wonderful in this role. She really does capture the attitude and heart of the video game character. She is so great in these action sequences, the fights and chases. Walton Goggins is an absolutely fantastic actor, but his character, this villain, is so generic and bland that any actor could have been plucked out for the role.This isn't a perfect film; the story at times and the dialogue can take you out of the film. There's an extremely unnecessary subplot with Daniel Wu's character, and the editing during the action sequences can be so jarring - 3 or 4 cuts per second. Today's age and what we see time and time again with certain directors, I can't help but be disappointed when blockbuster films such as this can't get the editing right. Some pretty good CGI though, and the video game aspects made me so happy, seeing them translated on screen with what today's technology can give us! The dungeon puzzles, the weapons, locations and battles - this film also includes a lot more violence and gore than I would have guessed.","Tomb Raider",10212,2.7,-0.3
"10213",5,"  Amazing movie! It Shows Lara Croft before being ""Lara Croft"" but with her essence. This movie is about the new reboot of franchise (2013). Truly fans will love this movie.","Tomb Raider",10213,2.7,-2.3
"10214",5,"  I am a huge fan of the 2013 Tomb Raider game and its sequel. So I was really looking forward to this incarnation of Lara Croft on the big screen. This movie did not disappoint. Don't go see it expecting Oscar caliber acting and writing! Go see for the love of the serial action genre and just fun action. I can't wait to see what else they do with this film in the future!","Tomb Raider",10214,2.7,-2.3
"10215",3,"  Tomb Raider brings Lara Croft back to the big-screen with a clearer understanding of its source material than the Angelina Jolie films and a flawed but relatively entertaining adventure movie to boot, it isn't perfect but close enough!","Tomb Raider",10215,2.7,-0.3
"10216",5,"  Just watched it and thought it was a great movie a bit slow to the start but really picked up and was true to the new video games. I hope to see a whole series spring from this movie.","Tomb Raider",10216,2.7,-2.3
"10217",4.5,"  The movie looks a lot like the Game. I missed Angelina but this movie is more real.","Tomb Raider",10217,2.7,-1.8
"10218",5,"  Excellent movie a very cool herione and not super powers just brains, tough, and dam good looking. Looking forward to the sequel since the armed her with her trademark guns at the end.","Tomb Raider",10218,2.7,-2.3
"10219",3.5,"  Apart from feeling a little drawn out I enjoyed the movie and would say to anyone who is tossing up whether to go or not (maybe based on the critics) to go. It's got plenty of action and it's done well, I thought the villain was played nice and not over the top - I wouldn't have wanted to mess with him - and the support cast did a good job.Obvious sequel set up was a bit in your face - and if they don't make one will look dumb - but overall good entertaining movie.","Tomb Raider",10219,2.7,-0.8
"10220",5,"  The poor rating that this movie got is seen all over Lora craft in the film. This movie was fantastic and she is such a strong woman as an actor and a character. But since it's no ""Black Panther"" rotten tomatoes gave it a low score. Typical... 5/5 stars for me.","Tomb Raider",10220,2.7,-2.3
"10221",3,"  After all these years, Hollywood bringing to life so many game adaptations, but almost all of these movies failed miserably. And now, in 2018, the director, Roar Uthaug and Alicia Vikander bring to life THE best game adaptation. Of course, the movie plot is still simple and predictable BUT, don't forget the fact: The Tomb Raider games was never more than that! This movie is FUN, packed with good action, the visuals are great also the music. Most importantly, Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft! I follow her carrier from the begining, so I knew she's an amazing actress, but still, her performance is blow me away! In this movie, the villain is not just some random dude, who want's to rule the world. He has some good and solid opinions why he do what he do. Walton Goggins performance is top notch as always. The one thing I missing is her relationship with her family. I think with some more backstory he could be more relatable character.The father-daughter relationship was well written, but they used that flashback scene too much, I think. I don't wanna tell more because that will be a spoiler but if you curious, Dominic West was great and he's character had some surprising development.And the last thing I've missed is, more Daniel Wu scenes and character development. I hope, when they make a sequel, they will bring him back some more action.Lastly, if you wanna see some copy paste game adaptation, or just want to see boobs, this is not yours movie. BUT, if you like fun and thrilling movies with good drama, than, go and watch Tomb Raider!","Tomb Raider",10221,2.7,-0.3
"10222",1.5,"  ""Tomb Raider"" (PG-13, 1:58) is a reboot of the erstwhile Angelina Jolie franchise (with 2001 and 2003 ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" films). All the movies are based on the British ""Tomb Raider"" action-adventure video game series, which came on the scene in 1996. Like the games, the movies have used various combinations of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Lara Croft"" (the franchises' central character) in their titles. Naming tweaks aside, the question is if the 2018 changes in casting & approach pay off for Movie Fans. While Jolie's casting and portrayal matched the look and attitude of the video game heroine, Oscar winner Alicia Vikander brings a leaner and less mean Lara Croft to the big screen. Jolie brought the bad-ass female archaeologist/adventurer to life with a lot of swagger, but Vikander's Croft is more physically and emotionally vulnerable, full of fight, but yet to realize her potential, intellectually or in practice. The quality both characterizations share is intelligence and guts, but 2018's ""Tomb Raider"" is an origin story.Seven years after the disappearance of her father, wealthy businessman and adventurer Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), Lara is a woman with no plan. Obviously intelligent, she's content trying to be a mixed martial artist and working as a bicycle messenger. She wouldn't have to work at all, if she would just sign the documents declaring her father legally dead so she can inherit his company and his fortune, but she's having a very hard time letting go of the hope that her father, whom she idolizes, is still alive.When company officer (and Lara's former legal guardian), Ana Miller (Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas), finally convinces Lara to swing by the office and sign those papers, Lara receives a Japanese puzzle box that her father left her. Solving the puzzle leads Lara to the discovery of what her father was really working on when he disappeared - trying to find the tomb of a legendary Japanese queen who supposedly possessed the power of life and death. Still hoping to find her father alive (or at least learn what happened to him), the clues lead Lara to Japan where she hires a reluctant but down-on-his-luck boat captain (Daniel Wu) to take her into the Devil's Sea to a remote island which is notoriously difficult to reach. Upon reaching the island, Lara discovers the ruthless Mathias Vogel (Emmy nominee Walter Goggins) leading an expedition to find the tomb for a mysterious international organization.Vikander's ""Tomb Raider"" (directed by Roar Uthaug) is a joyless, by-the-numbers actioner. In spite of Vikander's considerable talent and gravitas, she feels miscast as the tough and determined young adventurer. With the understanding that this is a Lara Croft origin story, it just becomes mind-numbing to see her beaten up throughout the movie, while none of the actors' performances rise about the level of serviceable. The script (by Evan Daugherty and Geneva Robertson-Dworet) features unnecessary dialog, characters whose motivations make little sense and a story which is mostly very predictable. Disappointing.

"10225",3.5,"  A good adventure film let down by a weak plot which lacks originality. The plot is serviceable with good characters, great acting and really good character development of the more human Lara Croft. The action scenes are good, but the CGI is poor and overall, the film is missing the spark that makes it great. Nowhere near as dark or violent as the game, and don't bother going to watch it in 3D - apart from 1 scene, there isn't any.","Tomb Raider",10225,2.7,-0.8

"10229",3,"  Tomb Raider (2018) - Review The GoodAlcia Vikander is Lara Croft, she does not phone it in she doesn't speak much in certain scenes, but Vikander is such a great actress her body shows it. A way better Tomb Raider than Angelina Jolie who was basically a cartoon. It 100% nails the tone of the 2013 much better than this Video GameThe Action Sequences are surprisingly good and has pretty good visual effects for a Video Game movie.The Score is pretty goodThe BadIt feels Pretty long - The first act feels bloated of exposition and it takes 40 minutes just to get the damn island, in the game it took a few minutes. There was no reason why this was longer than 100 minutes.The biggest weakness is the script its Dull and Exposition heavy that has to explain everything to you, if you know the game you know this story, but they change certain things. The Supporting Cast is wasted - Dominic West is just there, Nick Frost is only in 2 scenes, Daniel Wu barely does anything. The biggest crime is Walton Goggins is a generic villain, its mostly a paycheck for these actors.Some emotional beats work and some don't If you seen the first trailer then you saw the obvious sequel bait ending with her in a ponytail and a gun with Nick Frost, so good job dumbass Marketing Overall: I think this is a good step into the right direction for Video Game Movies cause this is the closest one yet way better than a lot of video game movies Cough Shit Resident Evil CoughOverall Grade: C+","Tomb Raider",10229,2.7,-0.3
"10230",5,"  If you've played the game do not expect the exact same story line. It's changed a little bit but still great non the less. Very action packed! Loved it!","Tomb Raider",10230,2.7,-2.3

"10232",5,"  A fun movie with good action scenes that will make happy even those who have never played the game of 2013. It's a good movie based on games and deserves all respect. the actress is perfect in the role and the facilities of the script is given for trying to be too faithful to the game condesando 18 hours of gameplay in 2 hours of screen. it is certainly better that the two Jolie films put together and a continued large budget would be a good start to solidify the saga.","Tomb Raider",10232,2.7,-2.3
"10233",4,"  Way underrate by the critics... sorry to see that.Its a pretty good down to earth video game adaptation...","Tomb Raider",10233,2.7,-1.3
"10234",2.5,"  The movie is a 6/10 for me . It was almost nothing like the game . Alicia vikander is a great lara croft. The dialogue was ass . Walton goggings didnt do the character he was suppose to good but that's obv the writers fault but in terms of his acting all he did the whole movie was look suprised and talked slow . The movie lacks emotion , it's like no one was alicia was trying . There's a decent amount of cheesy action movie stuff . About 3 good scenes that had me on the edge . Movie gets better as it goes . First hour was kinda dull and could have been sped up . But in total a fun watch .","Tomb Raider",10234,2.7,0.2
"10235",4,"  This was the 1st time I ever got the chance to watch TOMB RAIDER. And I have to say I really liked it. It's nothing like the old TOMB RAIDER. With Angelina Jolie. It's based off the Award-winning game from 2012. So I wish people would give it a chance","Tomb Raider",10235,2.7,-1.3
"10236",5,"  Awesome! Movie! Nice Reboot of The Franchise Great Action Great Story Must See!","Tomb Raider",10236,2.7,-2.3
"10237",2,"  Vikander does what she can with this story. It's a shame the story doesn't amount to much. The movie tries something original through the first half giving you a close in view of the action, from the characters perspective instead of the typical 10,000 foot view where the story arc is clearer, unfortunately, as the movie gets into the 3rd act the director has done very little plot development and resorts to tropes and hand waving to get to an unsatisfactory conclusion. Walton Goggins is the worst cast ever as the villain. Zero weight or menace to his character.","Tomb Raider",10237,2.7,0.7
"10238",4,"  A faithful creation to the games, but not a copy paste film. I would recommend it if you like action or adventure films.","Tomb Raider",10238,2.7,-1.3
"10239",2,"  This was a subpar cliche action flick that just happened to be called Tomb Raider. It was so loosely based off the games and the story of Lara Croft that it felt like it ripped the franchise off. If you havent ever played the new games then this may just be another ok action flick to you. However it was untrue to the story and spirit of Lara Croft.Alicia Vikander was the best part of the film. Everything else was either ridiculous or just meh. The story was one of the most uncompelling origin film stories every. The new games are such a better cinematic experience themselves, that I would instead recommend playing them through or watching someone play them through than watch this film.","Tomb Raider",10239,2.7,0.7
"10240",4,"  This depiction is more true to the reboot. I think the story was strong as a whole. Especially given this tired genre. I feel they did it justice even if they changed the story of the villains and made it less mythical.","Tomb Raider",10240,2.7,-1.3
"10241",3,"  Alicia Vikander is absolutely incredible in a poorly-written, underwhelming adaptation. Cut the first hour of exposition in London and give us more of her journey in Yamatai. That's what made the new games so incredible. Also, Dominic West's character arc (and involvement in the story overall) was a major dud.","Tomb Raider",10241,2.7,-0.3
"10242",3,"  Alicia Vikander tries her best but is still unable to create something memorable in this typical, ordinary, everyday & predictable action flick. Though Vikander is brilliant, the supporting cast drags her down in each & every scene. As far as origin stories go, this could have also been done much much better. Nevertheless, while doubtful, a hypothetical sequel with Alicia reprising her role but with a different director & scriptwriter would still be welcomed.(Updated from 15/03/2018)","Tomb Raider",10242,2.7,-0.3
"10243",2,"  Surprisingly, it isn't terrible! It's a fun and entertaining film within a tolerable run time of 111 minutes that feels more like a live action video game than a movie.","Tomb Raider",10243,2.7,0.7
"10244",4.5,"  Alicia did great as a young Lara Croft. She was resourceful and believable as Lara. The action was great and thankfully the special effects were great too. Not too much CGI like some fake reviews may suggest. Whatever cgi was there was more believable than some of those in MCU movies. It is a movie that I'll go back and see again. Runtime was nearly 2 hours but it didn't feel that long because the movie kept your interest.","Tomb Raider",10244,2.7,-1.8
"10245",5,"  SAw Tomb Raider last night. my 9 year old daughter loved it. strong film for her. she says 10 of 10.","Tomb Raider",10245,2.7,-2.3
"10246",4,"  Didn't expect to like this remake but it was pretty fun. i was disappointed in the lack of character development and the main character spent about 2/3 of the film squealing rather than communicating. Walton Goggins is always a great villain. This movie didn't stretch his skills too much though. Good action film but I was ready for it to be over by the end. I also wanted a continuing relationship with laura and lu which didn't materialize.","Tomb Raider",10246,2.7,-1.3
"10247",5,"  could not be better! is the best adaptation of a videogame to the big screen, alicia vikander is tremendous, she push her limits in this movie as lara crof in the game !!","Tomb Raider",10247,2.7,-2.3
"10248",3,"  Over the years, many writers and directors have attempted to make solid films based on beloved video game franchises, but they've almost always failed. For that reason alone, the bar was already very low, so this review may need to be taken with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Tomb Raider is easily one of the best adaptations ever made. It's riddled with many of the same issues that previous attempts have, but these movies need to have a sense of fun and adventure, which I believe this film provides. This movie isn't going to be remembered as great, but it will almost always be present when speaking about the best films to come from a video game. If you're a fan of the games or just want to have a fun (even if disposable) time at the movies, then here's why I will absolutely recommend Tomb Raider to you.It's many years after the disappearance of her father and Lara Croft sets out on a journey to find a tomb that has been a mystery for years. Being the island that her father reportedly died at, she's faced with the sadness of her past. Filled with energy and fun action set pieces, this film clicks along at a fairly brisk pace, even though it does drag in some areas. It tries very hard to accomplish an emotional core in order to win over its audience in the third act, and for the most part, it works. The emotional core is one of the more enjoyable aspects about Tomb Raider, due to the fact that the performances here are truly what elevates this film from mediocre to good.Alicia Vikander continuously reminds audiences around the world that she's an actress who will be around for a very long time and I have zero complaints about that. Her portrayal of Lara Croft is far better than what Angelina Jolie brought to the role many years ago and the sense of adventure and story itself is also on a much more mature level. From Walton Goggins as the core villain to the short amount of screen time that Dominic West has as Lara's father, I can't commend this film enough for trying very hard with its characters. That being said, the screenplay itself could've used a few tweaks.Yes, as you can see, I was pleasantly surprised during my experience of Tomb Raider, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows I'm afraid. The dialogue definitely feels streamlined at times, not leaving enough clues for the audience to figure out the puzzles. They choose to allow the characters on-screen to reveal the answers after they've figured them out in their heads. On top of that, the climax of this film places every character in an impossible situation and it felt like I was watching someone try to accomplish an impossible task in an adventure-based video game. If you can forgive that, then the climax can be quite entertaining, but it's also very ridiculous and out of place when comparing it to the rest of the movie.In the end, Tomb Raider definitely won't make any top ten lists for 2018, nor will it be remembered as a great movie, but it's without question one of the best adaptations from a video game that's ever been made. It's not without a few glaring issues and the dialogue can be slightly generic and cringe-worthy at times, but I'd be lying if I didn't call this a fun adventure flick with some terrific and devoted performances all around. For action junkies or fans dying to see a decent adaptation for once, I feel no shame in recommending this one. I'm happy to say that this isn't a bad film and I would actually love if they're able to make a sequel. That may not be saying much for some people, but that seems like a fairly strong statement to me.","Tomb Raider",10248,2.7,-0.3
"10249",4.5,"  Follows like an Indiana Jones film, mixed with the action drama of a mission impossible film. Enjoyable action movie.","Tomb Raider",10249,2.7,-1.8
"10250",3,"  It was entertaining, Alicia did a great job as Lara Croft. She was a much more realistic take on the character like the recent video games. This was far less cheesy than the Angelina Jolie films. Overall a decent film.","Tomb Raider",10250,2.7,-0.3
"10251",5,"  Wonderful reboot of Lara Croft-----Alicia Vikander is superb in this wild adventure fantasy movie, go see it!","Tomb Raider",10251,2.7,-2.3
"10252",1.5,"  I went in with an open mind. I am a fan of the original games and the reboot. I had cautious hopes after reading some reviews and when a friend got tickets to a preview I decided to give this film a chance after getting burned by Assassin's Creed last year. What a disappointment. For a big budget Hollywood film with a supposedly talented actress this one falls flat and would be a lame duck even for a Syfy Original Movie. No charm, no fun. Just CGI and noise. This is one to save for streaming...if at all. Video game curse alive and well...","Tomb Raider",10252,2.7,1.2
"10253",5,"  This is the best videogame movie ever! Alicia Vikander is even better then Angelina Jolie. Storywise: it has the nice touch of the 2013's Tomb Raider and 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider games, and it's because that this movie follows closely that storyline wich makes it special.","Tomb Raider",10253,2.7,-2.3
"10254",4,"  I find if I do the opposite of what the RT critics say I will like the movie.","Tomb Raider",10254,2.7,-1.3
"10255",5,"  It set the grounds for a lot of good things to come!","Tomb Raider",10255,2.7,-2.3
"10256",4.5,"  Don't listen to the critics if you're looking for a great adventure. If you lack imagination and have no interest in character development and puzzles, then don't see it. Alicia does a phenomenal job of capturing Lara, and adds a tremendous amount of depth while showing us how Lara becomes a hardened and skilled Raider. I loved seeing the small moments that have huge impacts on her and why she is the character we love. The things that happen and how she responds - is so real. I could completely identify with the inner conflicts she faces and that instantly made it more compelling to watch. Well filmed. Nothing overtly CGI. A few cheesy moments, but hey, this is entertainment. Not everyone wants to see depressingly accurate portrayals of circumstance. We're talking about booby traps and tombs people.... let yourself get lost in your imagination and enjoy the ride ;)","Tomb Raider",10256,2.7,-1.8
"10257",4,"  Overall this movie compliments the video game more than it copies it. As other reviewers have noted, if you played the recent prequel game than you have played through versions of this film which are nearly shot by shot live action remakes from the game. But I felt like overall the movie added a lot of value to the game more than competing against it. The first hour of the movie adds lots of exposition to the game to explain who Lara Croft was before the Tomb Raider, and who her family was. There is a lot of actually very interesting stuff in the first half of the movie that you do not get in the games and adds a lot of value to the games. About an hour in we get to the point where the video game starts (the shipwreck), which begins about another 30 minutes of shot by shot replication from the game (with one major change from the game's premise). Finally we get about 10 minutes of conclusion to the Tomb which wasn't in the game, an then the last 15 minutes of the movie tends to wrap up the story and mainly lead us to the other movie, showing how she turned into the Lara Croft that Angelina Jolie plays. So as you can see, the movie added a lot of value to the game, emphasising the parts of the medium that the movie is good at (storytelling) while the game offers more of the action sequences that games are good for. I feel like this is a great compliment of the medium and the game and the movie work very well together. Overall I think this is my favorite of the Tomb Raider movie series, and hope to see more in the future.","Tomb Raider",10257,2.7,-1.3
"10258",5,"  I loved it. No idea where the hate is coming from.","Tomb Raider",10258,2.7,-2.3
"10259",1.5,"  it feels like the protagonist and the movie are in different places. She is not Lara Croft, she is a different beast of her own, great actress but it is not the way to do the movie. A movie should have something else to stand out","Tomb Raider",10259,2.7,1.2
"10260",3,"  A decent film based on the 2013 reboot franchise of Tomb Raider, however while entertaining it does feel like it rushes to get all the elements in the 2 hour time slot and yet coming up short with all of the scenes you WANT to see not quite satisfying you to the fullest. Ultimately the movie left me desiring more. Had it have been an hour longer with Lara Croft doing what she's known for, I wouldn't have much complain beyond that. Sadly the video game in which this movie is based told the origin story much better.","Tomb Raider",10260,2.7,-0.3
"10261",1.5,"  The movie is a sad remake of a beloved character. The done to death formula has nothing new to offer and the average acting by supporting cast doesn't help the cause at all. Alicia is wonderful as the main lead but the supporting cast has nothing new to offer. Overall the movie is very bland and predictable with average dialogues and some good looking CGI in couple of the scenes.","Tomb Raider",10261,2.7,1.2

"10265",2.5,"  If you like the games, you may like this. If you like good movies you may not. I am stuck in between and found this movie a solid attempt. It's a paint-by-the-numbers adventure movie with nothing special to offer, but for a movie adaptation to a video game, it succeeds.","Tomb Raider",10265,2.7,0.2
"10266",5,"  best video game adaption yet! Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft breathes life and emotion into this reboot. The plot wasn't perfect but the way they set up the sequel and the action scenes make excited for a sequel. This is the female empowered action hero we deserve!","Tomb Raider",10266,2.7,-2.3
"10267",1.5,"  Wow this is bad... another bad adaptation of a good video game, sad.","Tomb Raider",10267,2.7,1.2
"10268",5,"  I literally made a rotten tomatoes account to rate this. I loved all the nods and throwbacks to the rebooted game and it made me happy to see how they made a plot that was different and interesting using the same elements. I can not wait for a sequel.","Tomb Raider",10268,2.7,-2.3
"10269",4,"  Better than expected. Definitely am going to see the sequel","Tomb Raider",10269,2.7,-1.3
"10270",4.5,"  Alicia Vikander blew me away! A legit action star but grounded in reality and made you feel something. Loved the Lara backstory and seeing her being a relatable young woman, being cute and fun in London and then really coming her own throughout the movie. You really do see her turning into the action star we all know as the film progressed. A great night at the movies!","Tomb Raider",10270,2.7,-1.8

"10273",4.5,"  Alicia Vikander is fantastic in the title role. She brings depth and dimension and makes Lara incredibly relate-able. Her nuanced performance and the realistic tone help the film to succeed in perfectly capturing the unforgiving tone of the 2013 reboot Tomb Raider video game. I feel the trailers do not do the film justice. 7.5/10","Tomb Raider",10273,2.7,-1.8
"10274",4.5,"  Great movie, looking forward to sequel. Critics are so lame lol.","Tomb Raider",10274,2.7,-1.8

"10276",5,"  Going in I was worried and hesitant to what they were doing with Lara , making her a bike courier, etc. I am pleased to say, that I left last night with a huge smile on my face! It follows the game for a good chunk of the movie but they did change a lot and added a lot. Alicia Vikander did a fantastic job as a young Lara Croft and how she got started! I plan to see it a few more times while in theaters and can't wait for the next movie!","Tomb Raider",10276,2.7,-2.3
"10277",5,"  pROBABLY THE BEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE SINCE PRINCE OF PERSIA","Tomb Raider",10277,2.7,-2.3
"10278",5,"  What a great movie this was. A true breath of fresh air, unlike all the politically correct rubbish being churned out of late, this story really takes you on a journey. Now as usual the critics don't know a good movie if it slapped them in the face and I feel it's because they still have no clue on how to rate action as a genre and have little understanding of all the great things this movie did to reboot the franchise. Alicia Vikander is such a scraper in this film, she really has you caring for both her character and her cause, with an enjoyable heroes journey, rather than a Mary sue skip to the finish. Some may say this makes the story predictable, which I say, ""the tomb raider, raided a tomb. Wtf were your expectations?"" Now here is the action breakdown, where there scenes that were badass? Yes, congratulations this is indeed a good film. I personal can't wait for the next instalment of this saga.","Tomb Raider",10278,2.7,-2.3
"10279",4.5,"  This is an origin story of Lara Croft, borrowing quite heavily from the rebooted 2013 game and the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider. in terms of action sequences Alicia Vikander absolutely nails it as Lara Croft bringing an emotional depth to the character, while also proving to be quite the action star. She worked hard for this role and it shows. The action scenes are tense, with a Lara who seems to be winging it much of the time, hoping for the best, while growing into her skills,and confidence. The film takes a more realistic route, while not taking itself too seriously, with a touch of humour to balance things out a little. My only real criticism is that the pacing near the end, once Lara escapes the tomb, felt a tad rushed. A must see for Tomb Raider and Alicia fans, and also if you like a good action adventure movie","Tomb Raider",10279,2.7,-1.8
"10280",5,"  Really Good. Has some great references to the reboot games that makes it feel like you can follow along and recognise elements of the storyline without making it boring by being exactly like the games. great to see lara becoming a badass, and seeing where she comes from in the world before heading off on her adventure. Vikanda does a fantastic job portraying croft, who feels familiar but also much more of a relatable character than previous portrayals. a must see for fans of the games, and thoroughly enjoyable to those who haven't played too.","Tomb Raider",10280,2.7,-2.3
"10281",3,"  ????????????????????????????????????? 6.5/10","Tomb Raider",10281,2.7,-0.3
"10282",3.5,"  A decent adaptation of the first rebooted game. It keeps the overall broad strokes of the story while being its own thing. It ties the stories of the two games together more than the games themselves as the Trinity connection is not really evident until the second game. Alicia Vikander makes a great young Lara Croft that is more rooted in reality but still walking off some rather serious injuries. If this gets a sequel, and I am hoping it will. It will be interesting to see if follows the story of Rise and how it might bring in the more fantastical elements of the game.","Tomb Raider",10282,2.7,-0.8
"10283",1.5,"  One of the worst adaptations i have ever seen. Wrong story, crucial parts of the story skipped and a lara that doesnt match the one in the game.","Tomb Raider",10283,2.7,1.2
"10284",3.5,"  Some interesting choices were made, but over all it feels like a Tomb Raider movie. And that's really all I wanted.","Tomb Raider",10284,2.7,-0.8
"10285",5,"  I like the Tomb Raider series. I have a full collection of Tomb Raider games on steam. I guess this movie should be adapted from a 9th-generation game, but there are many different places. Laura, played by Alicia Veccan, is excellent and I like it very much. I think the original battle is better than the old 2 and hopefully there will be a second one.","Tomb Raider",10285,2.7,-2.3
"10286",5,"  I am absolutely in love with this movie and although it has a few flaws, as a fan of the video game and know what the intention was story-wise (to take things from both rebooted games and some easter eggs and influences from older games and even movies), this was very well done and for me the video game curse has been broken thoroughly :)","Tomb Raider",10286,2.7,-2.3
"10287",5,"  Tomb Raider was good. As far as video game movies go, this was one of the best adaptations. Alicia Vikiander doesn't play the global-hopping, alien-fighting Lara Croft of the 90's, however, so if you're thinking this movie is going to have a stupid monster fight at the end, look elsewhere. This movie was more in line with Indiana Jones with a simple plot, good characters, and a really good ending. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Tomb Raider. It's not without its faults, but for an adventure movie based on a video game, you can do a lot worse.","Tomb Raider",10287,2.7,-2.3
"10288",3.5,"  Solid 7 out of ten. Mostly because Alicia Vikander is excellent.","Tomb Raider",10288,2.7,-0.8

"10290",3,"  Las películas basadas en videojuegos suelen pasar sin pena ni gloria. Adaptar un producto de más de cinco horas (jugando) es un verdadero reto; sin embargo, esta película logra funcionar por si sola y, pese a un comienzo lento y un villano mal ejecutado, tiene varios aciertos como la acción, efectos especiales y la trama con una relación padre e hija bastante bella.","Tomb Raider",10290,2.7,-0.3

"10294",4,"  Despite the harsh reviews, I really enjoyed the film. Although the script was awfully cliche at times and the story could have been developed further, they stayed true to the game, blending the 2013 reboot's Himiko storyline and Rise of The Tomb Raider's Trinity focus well. Cinematography was one of the highlights of the film, as was Vikander's performance. It was fun, didn't bore me a bit. A great video game adaptation.","Tomb Raider",10294,2.7,-1.3
"10295",3.5,"  Nobody expected this to succeed. Alicia Vikander gives it her all but the story is too thin. However, there was enough momentum in the first and third acts for people to enjoy.

"10299",4,"  4/5 As far as video game adaptations go, this is a damn good one. I'd rank in right up there with Silent Hill ass one of my favorites. While the movie doesn't quite follow the story of the game, it has enough of the elements and little nods to make you go ""oh, that's just like in the game."" Complete with a great performance from Alicia Vikander, I'd say this is a huge step in the right direction for video game adaptations.","Tomb Raider",10299,2.7,-1.3
"10300",4,"  Tomb Raider is a somewhat faithful adaptation of the recent 2013 video game of the same name. The cast of the movie are all great as the characters they play. The visual effects and CGI are noticeable at times but they don't pop and demand your attention. Someone just enjoying the movie will not notice it. The story of the movie is understandable but it definitely could've been done better. The score and other music in the movie is well used. Overall it's a really good and fun action movie.","Tomb Raider",10300,2.7,-1.3
"10301",5,"  I can see how people who have never played ""Tomb Raider Definitive Edition"" or ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" would give this film a poor rating. For me, as an avid fan of both games, I appreciate how they recreated so much of the games sequences, but also how they made a very enjoyable film version that is appealing for a broader audience. Alicia makes for an amazing Lara, she's strong and capable, but also vulnerable and you feel excited to be part of her journey. People who are comparing the movie to the game and expecting the first to be an exact copy of the later are just crazy.","Tomb Raider",10301,2.7,-2.3
"10302",4,"  Not going to lie, I thought this movie was going to be mediocre-godawful. I loved the game it was based off of, the reboot that square enix did(look it up, its amazing). This movie was solid, it had some very visceral action sequences.. it also had some reminders that ""hey this is a video game superhero"" because she def should have died or been paralyzed by a few things haha. That suspension of disbelief at moments was the only thing I knocked it a star for. Go see it, its a legit action flick, and she kills the role...shame on you jolie...shame lol","Tomb Raider",10302,2.7,-1.3
"10303",5,"  It was a really fun movie and really felt like the games on edge powerful tension.","Tomb Raider",10303,2.7,-2.3
"10304",5,"  Alicia Vikander is great in this, I also loved the action, 5 stars from me.","Tomb Raider",10304,2.7,-2.3
"10305",5,"  Surprisingly good and exhilarating.","Tomb Raider",10305,2.7,-2.3
"10306",5,"  I really enjoyed Tomb Raider, much more than i expected to. It's a fun throwback to the old Indiana Jones movies, with some great action and set pieces. But it's really Alicia Vikander that sells this thing . Her Lara Croft is more real, more vulnerable than the Angelina Jolie characterization. She is not a superhero, but a human being who makes mistakes, gets injured and really feels like she is in way over head, which adds stakes to her journey. And Alicia is such a talented actress, bringing so much nuance to the role that it is hard to keep your eyes off her. I hope that people give this film a shot, and that it ends up generating sequels. I want to see more of Alicia Vikander as Lara Crioft!","Tomb Raider",10306,2.7,-2.3
"10307",1,"  I was excited to see Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft and Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, the supporting actor... Despite their performances, the movie was disappointing. The plot was straightforward and dull with forcefully added ""exotic"" moments where the enslaved island workers tried to communicate with Wu in cantonese with a weird accent. At the beginning of the movie, the representation of Hong Kong was outrageous; from the string of little red lanterns at the back of the cab to the ""fishing village"" in Aberdeen. If the director chose to show the present modern image of London in the movie, there seemed to be either a mismatch of time or Croft didn't only travel to Hong Kong, but also time travelled back to the 80s to search for Lu Ren and his boat albeit showing an equally present aerial shot of Hong Kong before all the nonsense happen.All in all, glad to see a diverse mix of actors and actress in the movie and Vikander's Lara Croft was not objectified in the movie.","Tomb Raider",10307,2.7,1.7
"10308",2.5,"  Second rate plot and dialog, some shoddy acting..sadly it met the expectations that the trailer set for me. Alicia Vikander was not the problem though.","Tomb Raider",10308,2.7,0.2
"10309",3.5,"  Not sure why reviews are so split on this, because the movie is actually pretty good.","Tomb Raider",10309,2.7,-0.8
"10310",4,"  Is the new Tomb Raider merely a Japanese-themed version of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Yes. It is still very well acted, entertaining. It knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers on it.","Tomb Raider",10310,2.7,-1.3
"10311",2.5,"  A pretty average action film. Based on the 2013 reboot video game Tomb Raider this movie stars the excellent Alicia Vikander stars as Lara Croft who in this version is a bike courier hiding from her past. After her father Richard Croft (Dominic West) goes missing 7 years in the past Lara lives life not knowing what happened to him. One day when Lara is about to inherit all of her fathers fortune she uncovers a puzzle he left for her which leads her to a secret room where an old video of Richard reveals what he was last working on. This leads Lara across the globe where she hires a boat captain named Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) to take her to a mysterious island off the coast of Japan. There Laura and Lu discover a man named Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) who works for a mysterious group called Trinity that is trying to discover the secrets of the islands. Soon enough it's up to Laura stop Mathias and discover what her father died trying to prevent! So first off the movie does pay a lot of homage to the 2013 game and even has a pretty loose plot following it, but it does fall quite s bit flat. Lu is an unnecessary character and I felt like they should have used the original character he's slightly based on from the game instead for a more emotional connection to Laura. The bad guy here isn't bad and they even try to make him a humane character by having relatable goals, but for me it never worked here. I will say I did enjoy Alicia Vikander as Laura and hope if there's sequels she gets to develop the character even more. The dialogue in this film is sometimes so hammy and atrocious it takes away from the film. some CG isn't the greatest, but for the most part a majority of it looks great. The action is pretty intense, but it still had a slightly anti-climatic ending. Overall, I would say it's worth a rent if you're a fan of the series. Vikander does well here and works with what she's got. Anyone else not a fan should probably steer clear.","Tomb Raider",10311,2.7,0.2
"10312",5,"  Tomb Raider is everything a Video Game based movie should be. You find yourself on the edge of your seat with the suspense and anxiety that comes with this fast-paced action flick.","Tomb Raider",10312,2.7,-2.3
"10313",4.5,"  It was a great concept and story the actress I cannot remember her name at the moment was great throughout the whole movie with her emotional connection to the text the score was spot on and mixed very well and the cinematography was good. The bad is there are some clique moments and also visual effects need a little touch up other than that great great movie","Tomb Raider",10313,2.7,-1.8
"10314",5,"  Excellent, faithful to the tomb raider reboot and the original. Alicia Vikander is a superb young Lara. Impatiently awaiting the sequel!!","Tomb Raider",10314,2.7,-2.3
"10315",3.5,"  What is immediately recognizable in this film is the quality of the performances. The emotions and responses are refreshingly organic and believable. This is an action film that earns every step it takes. It was great seeing Lara's journey. Her transformation from traveller to survivalist to adventurer is well-done. The action is great. This is a must-see for fans of the rebooted games and those yearning for a classic adventure tale with some modern touches.","Tomb Raider",10315,2.7,-0.8
"10316",4,"  I liked this version with Alicia Vikander because the director kept it more realistic of a female in action versus Angolie's version which was more cartoonish and too commercial. Laura Croft in this version didn't always beat up everybody and found easy ways to escape. This Croft was more realistic and convincing of bravery rather than simple butt kicking throughout the movie. I give it 4 stars.","Tomb Raider",10316,2.7,-1.3
"10317",5,"  If you enjoy the video games by square eqix you will love this movie. Lara is at a crossroads in her life and she refuses to believe her father is dead, but is pressured to sign the paperwork, instead she takes of on an adventure to find him. The movie has the feel of the games, but it has its own unique story and I have no complaints about the acting, storyline, or cinematography. I was enthralled and on the edge of my seat. Great movie can't wait to see the next movie!","Tomb Raider",10317,2.7,-2.3
"10318",5,"  I thought the movie was pretty great! I keep stopping myself from saying amazing because though I don't think it was a perfect attempt it was EXACTLY what I wanted. Acted perfectly and as absurd as it needed to be to match the thrill of the games that fans LOVE SO MUCH. Go see this film!","Tomb Raider",10318,2.7,-2.3
"10319",1,"  Achievement unlocked! They managed to make the Jolie movies look halfway decent!Wasting the rich material they can draw from, Hollywood yet again dumbs it down for casual audiences - all in the name of ""world building"" and setting up the franchise for multiple entries down the line. You had one job, Hollywood. You just needed to follow the rebooted game's formula. And you still mucked it up. And who tf wrote the shitty screenplay?! How on earth did this project get greenlit?!You wasted Vikander's talent on shoddy scenario direction, a pedestrian script, and bland cinematography.I never write movie reviews during my free time, yet here we are.It's another case of a good game gone bad movie. ????","Tomb Raider",10319,2.7,1.7
"10320",4,"  True to the story it was based off. Fun, engaging, entertaining. Won't win any awards but worth a watch and a must watch for fans of the franchise.","Tomb Raider",10320,2.7,-1.3
"10321",4,"  True to the game it was based from, Tomb Raider is action packed and intense all the way throughout. This movie is pleasantly exaggerated just enough to match that of the video game. Alicia does an excellent job portraying a naive and innocent Lara Croft. This movie was done with enough care that a sequel is almost guaranteed. And well deserved.","Tomb Raider",10321,2.7,-1.3
"10322",5,"  Vikander is outstanding! Tomb Raider all in all is an enjoyable and action-packed thrill ride with spirit; well worth the watch in theaters and a great start to the reboot!!","Tomb Raider",10322,2.7,-2.3
"10323",3,"  So it's not a bad movie but it's not great ether. The problem is tomb raider is a 40hr game. It's not impossible but it's pretty damn hard. High lights were seeing ur favorite scenes done on the big screen. The cast was good Lara croft was great but she's a academy award winning actress and she put a lot of work in to the character. So is it worth seeing yah but maybe matinee or 1sr screening. As far as video game movies go it's one of the best but thats not saying much.","Tomb Raider",10323,2.7,-0.3
"10324",5,"  BEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE TO DATE !","Tomb Raider",10324,2.7,-2.3
"10325",2,"  Not a huge disappointment, but with no original ideas or vision and cliches atop other cliches it just barely makes it into the ""passable"" category.","Tomb Raider",10325,2.7,0.7
"10326",3,"  It was better than I expected. I wasn't expecting much. Alicia gave a good performance and they incorporated elements from the game in a reasonable way. If you're a Tomb Raider fan then you shouldn't miss this film.","Tomb Raider",10326,2.7,-0.3
"10327",3.5,"  It was an enjoyable movie to watch. There were parts that were lacking but overall, for a movie based off of a video game, they didn't muck it up too much to where it is unwatchable.","Tomb Raider",10327,2.7,-0.8
"10328",4,"  Tomb Raider is a good start to what hopefully becomes a perfect trilogy. We get a nice origin story with a character that is realistic and deals with issues that make her doubt herself and finds the ability to overcome hardships. The action scenes are filled with excitement. The violence more brutal than I expected considering the rating. All good things for a character like Lara Croft who has been a staple is the video world.","Tomb Raider",10328,2.7,-1.3
"10329",0.5,"  This movie had no idea what it was doing. When I saw it there was no reminants of the game they got lots of information wrong and cut out a huge portion of story. over all it wasn't really a good movie It mostly made me want to play the video game","Tomb Raider",10329,2.7,2.2
"10330",4.5,"  This is the best Tomb Raider Movie since 2001 flim! I don't care it's SUCKED!","Tomb Raider",10330,2.7,-1.8
"10331",3.5,"  Effective, entertaining and a solid start. This new Tomb Raider is full of clichês of the genre, but still works most of the time, Alicia Vikander is excellent as the title role of Lara Croft and sequence of actions are more fun that you could hope for. (3,5/5)","Tomb Raider",10331,2.7,-0.8
"10332",0.5,"  ""Tomb Raider""? More like ""Disney Princess in the Forest"". Horribly generic and boring, Vikander is completely miscast as ""Lara Croft"". Designed to please Social Justice Warriors while spitting in the face of millions of fans, it doesn't even make a good chick flick. Square Enix have allowed political correctness to destroy this once beloved icon. Any positives comments you read about this film is political bias, because, as a film, this is terrible from top to bottom.","Tomb Raider",10332,2.7,2.2
"10333",5,"  It was alright, still think Tom Holland's uncharted will be better.","Tomb Raider",10333,2.7,-2.3
"10334",5,"  So much fun. I might go see it again.","Tomb Raider",10334,2.7,-2.3
"10335",4,"  As someone who has played both reboot games, my expectations were mixed.I knew on a 90 million dollar budget they weren't going to be able to give us more of the video game, However, That's not to say the team behind this movie weren't going to figure out how give us alot of that Lara I came to love from the hours of moving her through puzzle after puzzle and danger after danger.Alicia Vikander has all the physical tools and she displayed them in this movie.I could tell from some of the scenes she really put her body through some tough moments to give us that shot.As I sat through the movie, Alicia's Lara grew more and more on me.I could tell she's a woman who had played the games and wanted to do justice to the part and for that I am thankful.I appreciate the plot twist in regards to Himiko and I feel Walton Goggins has the face for Mathias. Walton always has looked like someone who escaped the looney bin and Mathias needed that look to sell the part so thumbs up for casting Walton.So yeah. Really good action movie with a solid foundation from the game. 4 stars and here is to hoping it makes enough money to greenlight a sequel with double the budget so we can get 'Rise of' with more justice done.","Tomb Raider",10335,2.7,-1.3
"10336",5,"  it's amazing! I love Alicia playing Lara! I love the director of the movie and the production of art! but the script could be better","Tomb Raider",10336,2.7,-2.3
"10337",5,"  The Movie is so Intense, With full of Intense moment, and so unpredictable. But","Tomb Raider",10337,2.7,-2.3
"10338",4.5,"  That was way better than expected! Awesome!","Tomb Raider",10338,2.7,-1.8
"10339",5,"  I liked it. It was nice to go see a movie that wasn't so politically charged and was made to entertain.This version of Laura Croft is a young vulnerable one who is strong, smart and determined. It was a lot of fun to watch on her progress on screen.Not a perfect movie but definitely worth the watch in theaters. I gave it five stars because it deserves much better than the %50 it has on rotten tomatoes.","Tomb Raider",10339,2.7,-2.3
"10340",5,"  If you have played the games, you will love this movie! If not - maybe. There are many moments that pay homage to the games - where if you don't get the references you might think they're using unnecessary camera angles, or nonsensical action, etc. If you do get the references, it's brilliant.","Tomb Raider",10340,2.7,-2.3
"10341",5,"  A strong re-boot. I love Alicia as the new Lara. I feel like the Jolie movies focused more on Lara being a Sex-symbol when she is clearly so much more. She is strength, intelligence and a role model for women. This new movie really portrayed that for me. While the movie isn't identical to the 2013 game it certainly has some matching elements and lots of non stop action.I'd see it again!","Tomb Raider",10341,2.7,-2.3
"10342",1.5,"  all audience on my row went to washroom during the talking plot","Tomb Raider",10342,2.7,1.2
"10343",4,"  It was better than the average video game movie. The dialogue was average, but the actions sequences and sheer coolness of seeing Alicia Vikander pull off the Lara Croft stunts had everyone in the cinema cheering.","Tomb Raider",10343,2.7,-1.3
"10344",4.5,"  I really want to see Lara in action. Cause I love tomb raider games, this movie have potential","Tomb Raider",10344,2.7,-1.8
"10345",5,"  Watched this splendid piece of cinematography today in an IMAX cinema, and was blown away by the action, great acting, and amazing visual and sound effects! Cannot recommend this movie more and I must say, that this might be one of my favorite movies yet. Hoping for a second one.","Tomb Raider",10345,2.7,-2.3
"10346",5,"  Went into the movie optimistic it would mesh the mythology of the characters from the game as well as a grounded realityru and am delighted to say that I left the cinema very happy. Don't really see what people are being negative about the movie for, yes it's not going to win an Oscar but it delivers exactly what it intends, an adventure with a fantastic lead female and good supporting cast. The stakes feel real, the story is great and sucks you in to want to know what happens to our heroine next, roll on the sequel. If resident evil got 5 Movies by spitting out garbage then in comparison Tomb Raider should get at least 1 sequel. My rating is 9/10 simply because it ended! Will definitely watch again!","Tomb Raider",10346,2.7,-2.3
"10347",3.5,"  Based on the most recent run of Tomb Raider video games comes this new and improved Tomb Raider film which grounds the adventures of Lara Croft closer to reality than Angelina Jolie's 2001 adaptation. The story follows a pre-tomb raiding Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) who after a shock discovery decides to venture towards her missing father's last known location and uncover the secrets about what happened to him. I honestly didn't have the highest of expectations going into this film as the trailers were decent but not incredible. It all hinged on whether the film could emulate a similar feel to the Square Enix video game which is very action packed and exciting. And thankfully I feel like this adaptation exhibits the tone of the Tomb Raider video games very well and has formulated a story that works for the big screen. There is an absolute tonne of fun to be had here, the story itself may be very paint-by-numbers all the way through but there's plenty of tense action sequences, puzzle solving and thrilling chase sequences to keep you invested.I need to kick this off by highlighting the incredible Alicia Vikander and her fantastic performance as a very strong and believably capable Lara Croft who I may even prefer over Jolie. She has a certain charm about her that makes her a likeable protagonist and can also pull out the survival skills when she needs to and kick some ass. She has a very charismatic, determined, and strong-willed personality and overall she's just a very well fleshed out character who we see only get stronger with each passing moment. And when you have someone as immensely talented as Alicia Vikander it only enhances every one of her scenes as she proves here time and time again she can do the dramatic and emotional just as well as she can pull off action sequences convincingly. As far as villains go, Walton Goggins plays Mathias Vogel and he is great because he just has one of the most punchable faces in cinema and that is no different here. For the most part he plays a pretty generic villain with a simple goal in mind but Goggins does bring a certain level of charisma to the role that sparks some life in him. They do briefly try to flesh the character out a little more and give him a bit of a loose backstory for some added depth but it's never fully delved into.Daniel Wu plays Lu Ren, someone who assists Laura on her journey and for his limited screen time he's decent in the role. The problem with his character is he doesn't really have much to do over the course of the film so when the story does occasionally check in with him it's more of a distraction than it is intriguing.The story itself as I've mentioned is very generic, I mean, you can probably lay out beat for beat the entire series of events by the end of the first act, and that has nothing to do with knowing the events of the game as this takes a large number of liberties. But also the fact that it's very generic doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad as the action sequences and constant fast moving pace keep up the excitement level and I was very much invested for the majority of the last two acts. I left actually surprised at how thrilling some of the action-adventure sequences are and how well they are filmed to where I was genuinely on the edge of my seat for a number of moments. There are a handful of moments where the CGI isn't completely up to scratch and it's momentarily noticeable but I mean, due to the amount of fun I was having I barely took notice of it. As far as the tone goes it takes itself pretty seriously and isn't constantly going for the joke, which I think worked for the story. It feels a lot like the Tomb Raider game (which is obviously good) and even Uncharted at times without Nathan Drake's smartassery outlining every scene. There's one, maybe two moments where it does go for the joke unsuccessfully and it doesn't need to because it goes against the tone established early on.So overall I'm glad to say I enjoyed almost all of this Tomb Raider origin story reboot and had a tonne of fun from beginning to almost end. It does something with its final moments which I really wish it didn't do because it's extremely unnecessary and it doesn't have much of a bearing on the story being told within this film. It's disappointing they decided to close it off how they did but the rest of the movie can still be very much enjoyed. Alicia Vikander I can't stress enough about how great she is in the role and proved everyone who was doubting her ability to play Lara Croft convincingly very wrong. Video game movies have constantly struggled to adapt the game's story into a movie suitable format, and I'd say Tomb Raider has cemented itself as one of the better ones and well worth the watch.6.8/10","Tomb Raider",10347,2.7,-0.8
"10348",5,"  After searching so many years for a good video game adaptation film, finally Tomb Raider comes along. For those who have played the recent games Tomb Raider 2013 and Rise of the Tomb Raider there are plenty of moments, beats, segments and nods to get you excited. I went to see it with a friend who hadn't played the new games and enjoyed it as much as i did. As always with newer films there gives us lots of bread crumbs for the potential sequel, which i'm hoping happens. Ignore the critics on this one and make up your own mind. I'll be going again soon. A great movie and Alicia IS Lara Croft","Tomb Raider",10348,2.7,-2.3

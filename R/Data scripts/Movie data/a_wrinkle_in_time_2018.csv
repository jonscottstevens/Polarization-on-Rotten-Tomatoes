"1",1,"  It's hard to know where to start. The kids acting was great. Chris Pine is fantastic eye candy. The mom was good. Oprah, Reese and Mindy looked stilted. Everything else was awful. The editing, how it was shot, the scripting, the direction, how it lurched from scene to scene without making sense, how it failed to develop characters... its 2 hours you'll never get back, so don't bother."
"2",1,"  Awful movie, don't waste your time or money. YUCK!"
"3",0.5,"  One of the wort movies I have ever seen. I read the book, and wasn't in love with it to begin with as an adult. More of a book you should read as a kid, because the level of the material, and this maybe falls in with the same problem? I love Reese Witherspoon, but not even her presence in the movie could salvage it. I was literally counting down the minutes until I could leave the theater. I thought about it, but decided to ride it out. Don't go."
"4",5,"  Incredible. Absolutely incredible. My imagination has been broadened just by looking at the poster. Anybody who hated this movie is a liar."
"5",1.5,"  The only reason I give it a 1.5 is the Neighborhood scene and the child actors, the rest was just a disappointment."
"6",1.5,"  WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH?"
"7",0.5,"  This was the second worst movie that I have ever seen in 51 years. The worst ever! what a waste of time and money. Not even worth a DVD rental"
"8",3.5,"  This take on the book A Wrinkle in Time is done in a way that it feels like it will be loved more in the years to come than in the time it first comes out. The cast does a good job to bring up the message about how you are perfect just the way you are, but they do have some faults. Storm Reid definitely takes the cake with her dramatic performance but the rest of the cast falls a little flat but there characters are portrayed well. This movie needs a little more credit for it's visuals and performances. Disney took a risk with this movie and the final product is honourable even though it had faults."
"9",1,"  Although great scenery and special effects, the story line was bland and confusing. The way the story was told was to confusing and illogical. Things happened in the movie that were unexplained and confusing. Overall, I did not enjoy this film at all."
"10",2,"  This was probably a good movie for young girls, but it was so slow and boring. I think I remember the books being more exciting, but this one didn't have much to it. I wouldn't waste your time watching this movie unless you have a young daughter."
"11",0.5,"  The main motivation for Disney to create this garbage was the dream of a day when they can create a new 'Harry Potter'"
"12",3,"  Imaginative but lacking genuine complexity. Loved lead Storm Reid, impressive young actress and Oprah has real screen presence but a few less flying flowers and a bit more genuine moral dilemmas would have improved it. Ambitious but ultimately not what it could have been"
"13",2,"  Ruined by unnecessarily long pauses and reaction shots. Levi Miller is a true star here... but how is it possible to make even Reese Witherspoon seem like a bad actress??"
"14",0.5,"  One of the worse movie I saw in my life. I understand why the book is popular, Unfortunately, some stories can't be tell in a movie. It's a total miss!!! Horrible!!! Don't go!!!"
"15",2,"  Rushed ending and this movie is just messed up it was quick and it's like something you can't keep up with."
"16",0.5,"  wow what a waste of time. I hate I took my children to this."
"17",3.5,"  The cinematic relationship within an adaptation between a book and a film tends to attract spectators to the film before knowing there's already a book at the first thought. Should I read the book before seeing the film to see whether or not it's a faithful adaptation? Or just go straight to the film and read the book another time? It should be based on the level of your own anticipation towards the upcoming film that you may like to see in the theaters before reading the book.""The Martian"" provided an interesting narrative while ""Wonder"" showed a heartening promise, and both films apparently proved to be subconsciously faithful without reading the book. Then there's Disney's latest dive into the fantasy genre as a new film form of imagination that's based off from the pages being transformed under Disney's magical hypnosis effect. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" was earlier compelling, along with a nice set of announced cast, by a possible mysterious concept that may be concerning time travel. But after seeing the film, after being compelled to check out the book a week prior, it may have been a different experience below the initial expectations.The story focuses on a young girl named Meg Murry, who been dealing with the disappearance of her father Dr. Alex Murry for five years since he somehow discovered a new planet. Her wandering little brother Charles Wallace meets the mysterious astral travelers Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which; then the two siblings, joined by Meg's classmate Calvin, got put into a dangerous journey to bring back their father under the travelers' guidance. It would take the kids' bravery to get through a planet that possesses the universe's evil soul, while the siblings' bond will be put into an eventual test along the way.From what I grasped after the first viewing, ""A Wrinkle in Time"" is rather complex to the meaningful soul mainly by the abrupt folds in the narrative flow, lacking any smoothness for the characters and the overall approach. It's another of those attempts made by Disney to be ambitious only to occasionally falter when created a visionary void with not much to fill the rest for balance that's relied on to the writing and the cast. The descriptive and emotional human soul noticeably provides repetitive moments for the heroine's understanding of the surrounding circumstance with communicated lines that tried to go beyond, only to turn out to be awkward writing.Thanks to the writing, it had affected the nicely-selected cast's somewhat squandered talents, but not their charms when putting literal-balanced energy into their characters. Respectively portraying the astral travelers, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling did their best to guide through a fantasy scale while radiating pleasantness in their known presence. Chris Pine energetically performed fine when setting the idea up and trying to put it all to rest. The main, most-energetic spotlight goes to the young stars Levi Miller and breakthroughs Storm Reid and Deric McCabe as they venture throughout the given flow and gave it their best than the veteran actors, though still part of the unbalancing. Simply put, the appealing cast performed decently at the film's average.Director Ava DuVernay's intention with this project besides going into the adaptation and having fun along with the rest of the cast is to express a message about diversity and female empowerment, with Jennifer Lee from ""Frozen"" as one of the writers. She did that nicely well amid the visionary void through the characterization under her own spin, especially when providing an insightful understanding as a moral pinch of social commentary salt - hence the meaningfulness. Accompanying that approach next to the characters, along with occasional unique style, is the elegantly fitting music that seems to express the encouraging spirit that composer Ramin Djawadi didn't need to heighten.So yeah ""A Wrinkle in Time"" may be questioned regarding its faithfulness to the unread source material as it would take another viewing then a reading of the book to fully grasp it. But as of the first viewing, despite not really being engaging as hoped, it's a decent film for visual entertainment with a subtext in the veins as part of the celebrated soul in reflection form. How flawed it may be at the front with qualities to enjoyably appreciate, it's more important that the cast and production crew had fun doing the project. Otherwise if they didn't, it would be a bad movie. (B)"
"18",1,"  A candidate for worst movie of the year, as this thing was horrible."
"19",5,"  I LOVED this movie. It is wonderful in every way."
"20",0.5,"  Horrible Directing, horrible story line, and horrible acting across the board, make this perhaps the worst $100 million dollar movie ever made! In fact, it may be the worst movie ever made regardless of the budget! Painful and cringe worthy throughout!"
"21",0.5,"  I´ll not recomend this movie to anyone."
"22",3,"  OK Writing: 1 starThe writing seems very deep and psychological but the characters and conflicts have no significance. The movie has almost no purpose other then developing the protagonist self confidence. In the end the entire plot was based on believing in yourself but when nothing else in the movie has significance why have a greater supernatural conflict?Great Production: 2 StarsCast, special effects, set design and cinematography were all great."
"23",2,"  I had been looking forward to seeing this movie as it was one of my favourite childhood books. It was visually beautiful, but I was really disappointed with the interpretation."
"24",0.5,"  Very disappointing!!"
"25",0.5,"  Honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. From the stories development, flow and progression, the acting, the script, just everything. Everything just awful."
"26",2.5,"  A rarity for me being so baffled by a movie; I highly anticipated A Wrinkle In Time from the moment I heard it was in production. Then came the amazing first teaser trailer which captivated me more in 1 min and 50 secs then the entire movie did. This was set to be a poignant movie experience and perhaps was, but not in the manner that I had expected. Walking into this movie I wanted to be transcended with emotion and evoked with deep thought, deep adventure and deep story telling considering the amazing cast featuring none other then Oprah. This was a poignant experience, but more of one that left me confused, unfulfilled and dumbfounded. All that deepness I hoped was left wading in shallow waters. Not having read the book I went to this with pure movie mindset and walked out thinking I may need to read the book to get even an ounce of what this story was. Major, and I do mean major, plot holes are all over the place in this movie that lacks any kind of depth to what is being told. The climax of the movie is perhaps the worst part of it all. Its much of a Alice in Wonderland story, however the journey is no where near as fun and charismatic. Kudos to the wonderful cast, however they could have pushed their characters a bit more. One gripping emotional moment shared between two characters/actors does bring you into the movie one extra much needed level. This movie left me so unsure of what to think that Im even more unsure of how to critique it or my thoughts of it. With all that said Im curious of its Rewatchability factor. If I see this on TV down the road would I tune in? Thats where my intrigue peaks itself. Watching it again I may be forgiving of the plot holes or the distributing climax. The journey is simple and could make for an easy movie to tune into at any point ,have on, and not need to pay close attention to while doing stuff around the house. For that it might make it worth the rewatch for the emotional, but short, moment during the climax. Basically, wading in shallow waters can be relaxing. Only time will tell for this one, so I guess it does live up to its namesake."
"27",1,"  This movie is very slow and boring, The visuals are good but that is all that is really good. Go read the book instead."
"28",1,"  great story, but the make-up artist is awful. Oprah Winfrey, an imposing woman, is made up with a lot of glittery makeup such as silver glittery lips, in closeup."
"29",2,"  Not as good as I expected at all."
"30",1.5,"  Dont wsste your money or time. Book wad a hundred times bettet. Over used graphics poorly done at that. Chris Pine lowered his standard. 1% good graphics. Stiry line depressing. Not a feel good mivie. Youll contemplate suicide after watching..."
"31",1.5,"  When I went to see this movie I was reallly exited but I really felt the movie was underwhelming . First of all the main actor (Storm Reid) was by no means terrible but her line are often delivered akwardly and that slows down the whole movie. The worst part about this movie is the special affects. Every thing in the show felt so fake and most of the time you can tell they are on a green screen and that takes from the magic. Overall I would give this one a skip"
"32",0.5,"  Worst Disney movie EVER. It should be called, :A waste of time."" 1.75 hrs of my life I won't get back."
"33",1,"  yikes.... horrible cgi... horrible costume and makeup... horrible dialogue....."
"34",3,"  This movie was okay, I saw it in the movie theatres. I enjoyed it for the most part but some parts just lost me and didn't make any sense. Some parts of the movie went either too slow or too fast. Some parts are just too cringe for me to handle. Other than that I loved Storm Reid and Chris Pine, they were very good in this movie."
"35",5,"  This is was the greatest movie I've ever seen besides the Marvel franchise"
"36",1,"  Beautiful special effects but the storytelling was dead. It got boring and confusing by the middle. It all happened really fast there was no time to appreciate each character or know more about them."
"37",0.5,"  Horrible movie. You get no sense of any real asveture. Aside from terrible story telling the movie makes no sense. Disney never should have removed the one element that binds the characters and story in the book: religion."
"38",0.5,"  I... kind of hated this film, and I feel bad saying that as there are not a lot of films I end up actively disliking upon viewing them. ""It was different from the book"" is no excuse because it's a film adaptation and some of the best adaptations I've seen take the heart and SPIRIT of a book without strictly following it line to line! This film, however, does the opposite--it removes the best parts of the book and keeps the most weak parts, adding to the weakness and even dragging it out.You know the ""happy medium"" that has been pretty universally terrible in every version? Well the actor himself is thankfully more tolerable here but I hope you enjoy watching people struggle to stand on one foot for half an hour (this scene drags on and onnnnnn). Similarly, the magical creature ride on the first planet they get to... in the book at least they had a reason for the ride, to see the darkness and watch light literally fight it off giving you further insight into what sort of wonderous creatures the 3 lady's are and how important the battle is... in the film that is ALL gone and you're left with less than stellar CGI with our characters stupidly grinning in ""wonder"", omg, how magical! Except we're flying for no reason. And there's an action sequence because we were dumb, and that's REALLY what I wanted to see-- Our characters (who are all supposed to be extremely smart) doing STUPID things.I'm going to have to bullet point the rest of this because I have so many complaints:* The witches are introduced and are stunning and beautiful the entire film. This is a problem because they're supposed to be seen as quirky homeless-types at the start (the sort of person you might genuinely be concerned your 7 year old is talking to) which makes their later glory/wisdom all the more surprising and meaningful.* Talking/moving flowers. Puke.* Calvin is useless in this film. The actor does fine (though all he really has to do is smile and praise our protagonist at weird moments). I would have cut film Calvin entirely, he contributes nothing plot-wise or theme-wise.* Meg is not portrayed as actually smart, she's just a normal high schooler dealing with the stereotypical high school bully problems. Charles Wallace isn't smart either--but they TALK about how smart he is and we see him drawing so that must mean he's smart, right?! No, that just means he likes doodling like every other kid.* Bouncing ball Camazotz scene: not terrible, actually. But it could have been a lot more unnerving and creepy. It was way too short and transitioned into my next complaint--* Beach scene. What the actual heck. Charles Wallace just gets brainwashed... because. Why not In the book he gets taken control of because he CHOOSES to go to IT, his hubris and feelings of superiority gets the best of him and leads to his downfall. So much more interesting than ""number number, okay, I'm bad now for no reason.""* Meg and her father. I admit that I loved the scene of them reuniting, that was well acted and sweet. But god almighty the movie deliberately chose not to address him leaving Charles Wallace behind and Meg being furious at him because of it. In fact, Meg isn't given a moment of bravery and sacrifice CHOOSING to return alone to try and save her brother, instead she just screams and refuses to get whisked away in the first place. Look, I get time restrictions and all but couldn't you have cut 10 minutes of rock balancing and green creature flying to actually give our characters a meaningful arc?In this movie people are special just because people say they are, not because they actually say or do anything special. The whole time I watched it I just cringed or groaned. Heck, I'll even say that the crappy tv movie was better than this one because at LEAST they got some of the arcs right (and I can forgive some bad effects since they obviously didn't have the money)."
"39",5,"  Such a good movie, good story line and very interesting and very good connection between little girl and boy."
"40",3.5,"  The movie partially followed the book. The movie partially followed the book. There were no beach scene in the book! I really wished the director, writer would follow the book."
"41",2.5,"  Meg (the protagonist) was well acted and written. Sadly, the rest of the characters felt flat/2 dimensional. I realize it's primarily a kid's movie, but c'mon disney. This felt lazy as far as character development went. The incredibles and monsters Inc had much richer characters that the audience cared about.Someone said they'd bring their tween to watch this. I seriously don't think any of my nieces or nephews over the age of 10 would find it engaging enough to sit for the whole thing. It did ramble as someone else said here. ALL THIS SAID, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE FUN AND THE MESSAGE IS ONE THAT IS WORTH REPEATING."
"42",1,"  It's just ... not good. Charles Wallace is ... after adjusting for him being just a kid ... actually surprisingly good, and Meg did well enough. Almost everyone else seems to have seen the script for the first time five minutes before the cameras started rolling (the exceptions are Reese Witherspoon and Zach Gallifianakis, who play characters that are kind of cliched, but at least don't just appear to be cold reading their lines off of cue cards).A LOT of liberties were taken with the source material, and ultimately there was only one of them that I would be willing to say ""Okay, that was different, but it wasn't clearly worse in every way"" (that being the Happy Medium). The movie lingers on scenes that should have been much shorter if not cut entirely. I can forgive the omission of Meg's older brothers but reducing Aunt Beast's entire species to a three second cameo is just intolerable."
"43",5,"  A Wrinkle in Time, summed up in one word is Amazing. Amazing All-Star cast, amazing music, amazing CGI, amazing plot, and amazing sound/visual effects. I want to see more of the Time Quintet, the book series by Madeleine L 'Engle, become amazing films like this one."
"44",0.5,"  It was beautiful but seemed like a 100 Million dollar ode to clothinG celebRitIes in weird couture. The plot was reduced to a Dark shadow of What it should have been, not even making sense anymore. Buzzworded to death with faux girl power phrasinG ""be a warrior."" It was Hot garbage and im glad the author will never have to see it."
"45",2,"  once I got over the visuals i was bored."
"46",1,"  an absolutely terrible waste of everything -Extremely poorly directed"
"47",1.5,"  Cinematography was amazing but that's about the only thing that is. I found the story boring and hard to get into. I kept looking at my watch to see when the movie would finish. I would recommend spending your money on a different movie."
"48",1,"  Just not good. Please stop with the close camera shots as well. I appreciate the effort but not good."
"49",0.5,"  Poor Poor Poor. Save your money"
"50",0.5,"  Bad does not describe it If it was not a Disney movie It would not have been theaters for more than a week"
"51",1,"  Disney Channel meets The View. Insufferable platitudes about the light and the dark and personal empowerment woven through a never-ending series of special effects, sprinked with a cringe-worthy way-too-young love affair, all created in the service of a feminist agenda. The perfect storm for a move that you have to work hard to sit all the way through. Oprah can't act to save her life, but her performance is Oscar-worthy compared to Mindy Kaling's, which has all the dynamic expression of a wet log. The director somehow even managed to drag all the personality out of Zach Galifianakis. As in all the feminist propoganda movies of late, the movie culminates in the father figure apologizing for his abandonment, even though in the book he did no such thing. Take a pass on this train wreck of a movie."
"52",3.5,"  Disney's latest live-action outing is a dimension-traversing trip that centres on troubled 13-year-old Meg (Storm Reid), as she journeys into the unknown to find her scientist father (Chris Pine) who disappeared four years earlier. Joined by her precocious whizz-kid brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and cute-guy-next-door Calvin (Levi Miller), our headstrong but vulnerable protagonist must confront both evil otherworldly forces and her own life-blocking emotions. Aiming to be accessible for younger audiences, the core message - internal growth is impossible without self-belief - is hardly new, but, despite a completely on-the-nose delivery, it's also effective. The connective tissue isn't always the best (the less time spent thinking about plot machinations the better), though there's no shortage of thrills and wonder, or heart wrenching payoffs, in the numerous high-concept set pieces. There are parts of this movie that are unintentionally silly and a few of director Ava DuVerney's stylistic choices are dubious (over-sized Oprah Winfrey? standard black-tentacle incarnation of 'evil'?), yet enough goodwill is generated elsewhere to forgive these missteps. DuVerney doesn't hide her influences either, family classics such as Avatar and Wizard of Oz are obvious touchstones whilst more adult-leaning masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey and even The Exorcist (""Charles Wallace is not at home right now"") provide inspiration. Reid is an absolute gem in the lead role too, equally convincing in her self-destructive stubbornness to detach from the world as she is in the gradual shift to valuing her strengths, weaknesses and everything in between. She feels right at home sharing the big screen with Hollywood veterans such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, who, along with comedian Mindy Kaling, play an amusing trio of peculiar beings that guide our heroes on their trek. Ambitious to a fault, A Wrinkle in Time is a family-friendly fantasy saga that wears its heart on its sleeve whilst delivering a visually wondrous, if occasionally scatty, rollercoaster ride."
"53",3.5,"  While it wasn't the most compelling adaptation of the book, there was a lot of good going on in this film. As many have said, it was visually stunning. That's a given. The message was a great one, and one worth remembering whether you're a kid or an adult. It is certainly important to go in with a child's wonder, as some of the gaps or character traits are not as explained/fleshed out as in some other movies. However, the multilayered character portrayal of Meg Murray (Storm Reid) is as rich as one could ever hope for, and that, along with the story of her journey, is really what carries this movie. Good, and certainly worth watching, especially if you have a tween. Definitely worth a watch."
"54",2.5,"  I read the reviews before seeing it, so my expectations had been lowered and I'm glad they were. The visuals were amazing, but the story was just a bit thin, yet complicated at the same time if that makes sense.One recurring line in the film is ""I'm underwhelmed,"" which is ironic because that is exactly how this film makes you feel. They do all this work with the visuals, but the story line and the payoff are not worth it. As a result the film feels like a bunch of loosely connected scenes that you end up wanting to be explained or elaborated on, but they never get explained. For example, the scene we've all seen in the trailer of the suburban neighborhood where the kids are bouncing balls, lasts for just a couple minutes and we never return there. It is never explained. It is even curious why they would even cast an actress like Bellamy Young to play such a pointless character. There are scenes like that throughout the film.I never read the book, but I've seen movies that stay faithful to the book have this problem, so my guess is that's what happened: In trying to stay faithful to the original story, they created a movie that was just too thin and overly complicated and weird. Weird is okay, but you've got to add substance to justifiy it or at least make it make sense to the audience, which this film never does. By the end of the film, you're just like ""HUH?...Is that it?....2 hours and this is where we end up?"""
"55",0.5,"  The least they could have done would be to cast a few good looking people. I already can't stand Mindy and Reese. Such a dead bore"
"56",1,"  This movie is an honest waste of time, money, and the talents of Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, and Chris Pine. It doesn't give you time to believe what you're seeing on screen, asks you to suspend your disbelief to an insane degree, the child actors give unbearably stiff performances, nothing in the narrative ties together and it's all wrapped in a bow of mediocre special effects."
"57",1.5,"  It wrinkled my time and money... I'm not getting back either."
"58",0.5,"  Extremely boring. Thanks to Moviepass I didn't waste any money on this garbage."
"59",1,"  One of my favorite books when I was young. Very disappointing. Not appropriate for younger children!"
"60",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time is based on a beloved children's classic published in 1961. It's directed by Ava DuVernay, who was responsible for Selma, one of the best films of 2014. There's a reason that Marvel offered her the directing gig for Black Panther. This film has big names, a big budget, and big talent behind the camera with a focus on upping the inclusion at the Mouse House... so why is the movie so unfortunately awful? A Wrinkle in Time is one of the worst experiences I've had in a theater. I was so thoroughly unattached that I started questioning how something this bad was so beloved for decades by different generations of, what I must now assume, children with terrible taste.Meg (Storm Reid) is a teenager still dealing with the pain and anger from the four-year disappearance of her father, Mr. Murry (Chris Pine). He was a scientist trying to discover a new form of space-time travel powered by... love, I think. Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is stuck trying to rear he troublesome daughter and Meg's adopted little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Then one day they and Meg's crush, Calvin (Levi Miller), are visited by a trio of strange, powerful (aliens? witches? fairies? spirits?) women: Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). They inform Meg and company that they know where her father is. They must travel the universe to save him, battle the source of negativity, The It (no relation to Stephen King), and maybe learn a thing or two about accepting one's true self, faults and all.Oprah as Dragonball Z?A Wrinkle in Time is simultaneously over complicated and meaninglessly shallow. I was baffled throughout the entirely of its near two-hour running time trying to make sense of anything. The story felt like it was written by computer that had been programmed with the scraps of genre storytelling as an exercise. There is no real internal logic that holds everything together, which makes every moment feel arbitrary. The story also lacks another vital aspect every fantasy movie needs - clarity. The goal is for the kids to find and rescue Mr. Murry, but every step leading to this goal feels unclear. Scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment, you don't have any clue how what they are doing will lead them any closer to achieving this goal. Every scene just asserts itself, and then something happens, and then something else happens, and then it's done. Hey one minute the kids are going to talk with flowers because, for whatever reason, they're the little gossips of the plant world. Then Mrs. Whatsit turns into a plant mantis goddess giant. Then the kids hop on her back and fly, and then fly on her while she's also flying, and then one kid falls off, so whoops, but the gossipy plants catch him. And then none of that matters. Even the villain is a nebulous concept of negativity designed to link up with a character's personal journey. There's a plot insofar as stuff happens and then it doesn't. The rules of this universe are never properly established. Anything is just anything in this movie. The final planet, where they do indeed find Mr. Murry, could just have easily been their first stop. If a fantasy movie doesn't properly orient the audience to its world and rules, it's only a matter of time before that same audience checks out, frustrated and uninterested.Afterwards, I did something I hardly ever do and ventured to read the Wikipedia summary to discover what was in the original story by author Madeline L'Engle. Surely the screenwriters must have butchered this oft-touted children's classic. To my surprise, the summary of the book is pretty close to what ends up in DuVernay's film, with some slight modernizing and name changing (I wonder why DuVernay might not have wanted the Big Evil Source of All Negativity to be called ""The Black Thing."" Hmmm.). I think maybe the book was never good but was liked by kids, and then they remembered it being better and passed it along to their kids, and so on and so on, until somebody finally runs screaming through the streets, trying to get everyone to realize the harsh reality.Another factor that doesn't seem developed or helpful or fulfilling are the three magical beings played by Oprah, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon. It feels like they're more award show hosts constantly changing their wardrobes than characters. They offer very Oprah-like self-help platitudes about acceptance, courage, and self-actualization. I felt sympathy for each actress being wasted, in particular Kaling, who speaks only in quotes and a plethora of reaction shots where she practices a wise expression. Witherspoon is definitely overdoing it and Oprah has settled into being talk show Oprah. They felt like rejects from a discarded Alice in Wonderland movie but with less personality. I think you could cut all three out of the film completely. The only meaningful way these three characters impact the plot is as expositional devices, but even that is whimsical nonsense.Speaking of exposition, oh boy is this script really bad when it comes to dialogue. There's an early scene that exists purely to inform the audience about the Murry children and to be eavesdropped upon by Charles Wallace (that name deserves to belong to a tax attorney or a serial killer). ""She's smart but hasn't been the same since her dad left,"" says one teacher. ""Yeah, but that little brother of hers, he's got potential but he sure is weird."" The conversation feels painfully inauthentic and transparent. Don't these teachers have other students of equal interest at the school to discuss? The Murry children's father disappeared four years ago and they're still talking about them this sloppily? The final film is stuffed with these moments, with characters transparently telling the each other who they are or how they should feel at all times. The pointless romantic sidekick, Calvin, is literally introduced as coming over and saying, ""Hey I sorta know you from school, and I felt like I should be here,"" as if he could feel the screenplay calling him. Also, Meg just happens to live next door to her chief bully in school, who is still bullying her every day for whatever reason. It's been four freaking years since her father left, and apparently this still offends this girl on a daily basis? Most of the dialogue made me wince.It will sound mean but we need to talk about the bad child acting in A Wrinkle in Time. In the modern age, after Room, It, and The Florida Project in particular, there really is no excuse for bad child acting. If you cannot feature quality child actors, you aren't looking hard enough or that may be a fault of the director's own abilities. McCabe (Stephanie) is, in particular, a bad choice to carry much of the movie's emotional climax at the end. He even gets possessed by the Bad Negative Force and must channel menace. It comes across more like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum in a store. Much of the conclusion hinges on tight close-ups of McCabe bellowing. It's unfortunate for everyone. Reid (12 Years a Slave) fares a little better but is relatively inexpressive, going even beyond the general withdrawn nature of her character. Miller's (Pan) character serves no purpose. He offers no skill or breakthrough for the plot. He is just there, blank-faced, and providing PG-rated prepubescent romantic tension. Or perhaps Meg really needs to hear the strong encouragement from the voice of an attractive white male in order to finally personally succeed?DuVernay's direction has some nice, sweeping visuals but the movie as a whole feels far more awkward and misapplied with its budget. Some of the special effects are shockingly shoddy for this kind of major release from Disney. The fantasy worlds feel like holdovers from other fantasy movies with little memorable distinction. There is one effective moment visually that stands supreme, and that's when the trio encounter a suburban neighborhood populated with Children of the Damned-style kids all bouncing balls in sync. Their individual mothers come out and march in the same eerie synchronicity, and it's the best-conceived and executed piece in the film. It's also one of the few sequences where the editing is a benefit. The editing is conspicuously poor. Early on, when Mrs. Whatsit had first introduced herself, every cut failed to match, every camera movement created a disconnect of space, and it generally felt off. It didn't get better from there. When you notice the editing, unless you're in a Scorsese or Aranofsky movie, it's a bad sign.In many ways, this film reminds me of the misguided, flabbergasting, and fascinating failed passion project that was 2014's A Winter's Tale. I could dissect that movie and its multitudinous of wrong-ness for hours. With A Wrinkle in Time, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to enjoy the movie and root for DuVernay being given the reins of a major studio film. I loved Selma and diversity behind the camera is hard to come by in Hollywood, let alone a woman of color given this sort of platform. Sadly, it feels like DuVernay wasn't quite ready. A Wrinkle in Time gave me nothing to engage with early on. I didn't care about the characters, the plot felt like it was being made up as it went, the rules were unclear, the dialogue was inauthentic, there was no sense of momentum, and when it does accidentally stumble into something slightly interesting, it quickly moves along again. It's about the power of love overcoming the power of negativity. I don't know whom this movie is for. Children will be bored. Adults will shrug. This movie doesn't work on a fundamental level and it left me bored. I closed my eyes and dreamed of a better movie but it never came to be. My dear father, who had the misfortune of enduring this experience with me, turned to me during the end credits and said, ""I am now going to treat you... by taking you far away from this movie."" It's that bad, folks.Nate's Grade: D"
"61",0.5,"  One of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen."
"62",1,"  Just terrible. My niece was bored to tears and I wanted our money back 15 minutes into it."
"63",5,"  Stunning cinematography and powerful directing. There is no reason this film should have less than a four star rating. It's unfortunate that most people can't see beyond the diverse cast which seems to prompt the vicious ratings. Jealous much?"
"64",3.5,"  File under: solid popcorn flick with an AWESOME message and lots of heart. As a film goes, this is a visual masterpiece. I love DuVernay's choices top to bottom. I can't tell why it doesn't fully work for me, but I've seen it twice now with my 13 year-old daughter (who LOVES it), so something is working! It feels to me like it was cut a little too much. Like it should have been 10-20 minutes longer with a little more time spent on Meg's personal transformation. But whatever, I'm looking forward to owning this Blu Ray, and I hope that it gets released in 3D!"
"65",2,"  This movie seems a bit full of itself. It relied too much on colorful special effects and had WAY TOO MANY closeups of the characters looking around in faux wonder and amazement for a beat or two too long. The story should have been relied on more and the grandiose vision of the director less."
"66",0.5,"  Terrible. We walked out. Unwatchable."
"67",3.5,"  Three and half stars because of the message. I thought the actors did a fantastic job bringing those characters to life. The movie was esthetic visually with bright colors."
"68",1,"  Horrible, artless, unimaginative attempt that has killed all the charm and excitement of the story with a plot that is impossible to follow and close-up cinematography that makes you seasick. Oprah's glam, 70s makeup is clownish rather than bewitching, and the child actor for Charles Wallace is not up to the task of delivering his characters adult-like brainy dialogue. A big-budget disappointment."
"69",1,"  One of the worst movie adaptations since Avatar the Last Air Bender or Eragon. There is little to no character development, no explanation of what is going on or why just some vague suggestions. The story is boring and overused with barely any actual plot."
"70",3,"  This movie tried to put a message across about light and dark and the impact on our universe but itnfell short in so many ways. Acting wasnt great and there were chunks of content missing to help put the story together. Sadly disappointing."
"71",1.5,"  The acting was terrible and the message of the film was beat over our heads. There was zero nuance."
"72",1,"  This movie was a total car crash. I found it hard to make sense of, and the supernatural themes were not appropriate for a children's movie. It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time."
"73",1.5,"  I thought this movie was going to be a big shining diamond for Disney, but I was wrong. This movie was a big stain on the book movie category. it leaves out many scenes from the book and the trailer. The ant and string scene was in the trailer but wasn't in the movie. But anyways Calvin was probably the most boring part of the movie with his actor giving no energy into his role."
"74",3,"  I wanted to like this from the start; the ideas and the visuals were worthwhile & the characters charming, especially Storm Reid and a very mad Reese Witherspoon. However, the ""big bad"" was frankly quite shit, made no sense and was easily beaten. Also...the ending?"
"75",0.5,"  Absolutely the worst Disney movie I ever saw. If I could have walked out without climbing over other people's knees, I would have. Just horrible."
"76",2,"  I am a fan of teaching people that love is better than hate. The world could definitely use more love. My issue with this movie is that all of the good characters are syrupy sweet to the point of nausea and they speak in this fairytale aloof Mr. Rogers, Glenda the Good witch, Joel Olsteen kind of way that drips with insincerity. Good people aren't always slow sweet talking human beings. You can be down to earth and good. The movie was just too over the top and quite predictable. I am very dissapointed to have waited a year to see this. The previews made me look forward to it. Instead, it was a total letdown."
"77",4,"  How could people not like this movie?? It is good and the children can act!"
"78",1.5,"  Other than the kids trying to find their dad the plot did not make sense to me. Actually my sister and I were roasting the movie the entire time watching it for it's weird dialogue and some of the characters bizarre behavior.Actually at times with these characters it was like watching a comedy improve troop trying to make sense of a fantasy film than whimascal characters. I like Harry Potter movies but this particular movie made no sense to me. I think there was some sort of well meaning message. I'm sure the book is way better the problem is trying to condense it in a 109 minute film leaving some vital details out on how their universe works. Visual wise Oprah's eyebrows were the only eye-catching thing in this movie."
"79",3,"  The movie needed more runtime. 109 minutes was not long enough to properly explain the complexity of the themes presented in this film. With a full 130 minutes, Ms. Ava would have produced a complete film. This was rushed, and maybe that is because she was not afforded the same budget as her male and Caucasian counterparts. Interesting decision by Disney, who produced and distributed this film."
"80",5,"  A thoroughly solid and beautiful tween movie. Ignore the reviewers who can't remember how it felt to be entering the turmoil of teenage years."
"81",0.5,"  CRITICS giving 3/5 stars are being generous. There was no suspense, likeability of characters, and no comedy. The only positive of this movie was some of the special effects but even they weren't enough to stop me from nodding off. I am so DISAPPOINTed with disney and have no idea how this passed an approval board."
"82",2.5,"  Storyline just wasn't there. Acting was good and the effects great but without a flow of the story it just falls flat."
"83",3.5,"  Although most of the cast were spectacular, this film fell short in terms of authenticity to the book and two out of four of our party fell asleep during the movie. Visually it was amazing but something did not wow us."
"84",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time is director Ava DuVernay's first time helming a large budget feature after her success with 2014's Selma, and it also marks the first time a live-action film with a $100M+ production budget has been helmed by a woman of colour. A Wrinkle in Time is very ambitious and harbours a grand scope with a story that explores the unseen parts of the universe. Unfortunately the execution isn't great and it doesn't leave behind a whole lot to be enjoyed. The plot follows young Meg (Storm Reid) who after the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine) is visited by three mystical beings and embarks on an adventure through the universe to find him. The scope of the story is very large whilst also remaining focused on a small group of characters so despite the fact that it misses beats a lot of the time there is stuff in here I did like. The visuals are a definite strong point, very crisp and clear, and Meg's story actually does have a fair amount of heart and emotion going for it and it helps in offering something to keep you awake. But the negatives heavily outweigh the positives so even when it exhibits good things it still feels held back by everything else. I'll begin with the characters because where I loved Meg's personal journey through the film and her overall development, I wasn't really invested in any of the other characters aside from how they help Meg grow into her own. The path she takes through here is very engaging and its a journey all about family, love, and accepting who you are on the inside and out so her story individual story has a strong message to it. The relationship with her younger brother and her missing father is a well executed dynamic here and gives the film a lot of heart and a couple of strong emotional scenes you genuinely care about. But all of the other characters don't really have any individual arcs or growth, more or less the people they are at the outset is who they are when the credits roll. They serve their role in strengthening Meg's character but there wasn't really anything about them to latch onto. Her younger brother Charles Wallace played by very well by Deric McCabeÂ is the most engaging of the rest of the cast but that's due to his very unique 'out there' personality being quite the opposite to everyone else in here. The three beings played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey are fine, I didn't really enjoy watching them specifically but they bother me that much. They're vessels used to drive the plot forward and say motivational things to Meg, so they're there but they're not interesting characters.Â And then there's Calvin, Levi Miller's character whose name I had to look up and whose overall purpose in this story is pretty non-existent. He kind of just shows up at one point and joins the adventure but we don't know who he is and it's almost as if Meg doesn't know really who he is but he sticks around anyway. His character just feels so damn forced into this story like he was shoved in just for some sort of clichÃ© romantic angle because he doesn't really do anything. And I've got nothing against Levi's performance, I feel like he plays the character as he has been instructed it's just that there isn't a place in the story for him which is why he just floats around. The rest of the performances are all very fine, Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw included, it's just the writing of these characters and the way they do or don't play into the story which is very subpar.Â The overall story and physical journey the characters take through the universe fails to be engaging at almost any moment. As I mentioned, aside from Meg's personal story there's nothing of value to really grasp onto. The pacing is completely out of whack, the initial setup moves so fast it's hard to follow and leads to further issues, then later on large chunks of the film slow down to where it occasionally becomes a bit of a bore. The biggest problem stemming from the opening act being so rushed is a lot of the character decisions and reactions to certain events don't come across as very genuine, like the writers have just had characters accept certain things that I'd expect one would be questioning profusely. It also begins at a point where it feels like there's a lot of missing information, especially with Charles Wallace whose journey is already underway when Meg's story begins, some of this becomes clearer with time but it's all still a bit iffy. So many sequences just drag on and slow the film down drastically. For instance, one location they visit where they meet a character played by Zach GalifianakisÂ is eternally boring, the film screeches to a halt and it takes a bit to break out of that lull which is a shame. There is an antagonistic presence in here as is expected, but I still don't understand it and exactly what or why or how it is. I won't go into detail about it to withhold spoilers but it's just weirdly conveyed.Â So in the end, Ava DuVernay's first venture into the world of big budget fantasy adventures hasn't really gone to plan but she does some good things in here and she's more than proven her talents as a director in the past so I'm looking forward to her next project. Storm Reid is the strongest link in here and her performance brings a tonne of heart and emotion and beauty to the story where no-one else really does to the same level. Her growth over time is one of only things about the story I could grab onto and enjoy following, but despite it being good it's not enough to hold up the rest of the film. The performances are all fine and the visuals exceptional but with the lacklustre story and characters it's hard to really recommend the movie. As a casual watch I feel there might be just enough in here that a family audience can enjoy but don't expect that exciting of a fantasy adventure.Â 4/10"
"85",2,"  This movie reminds me of boxcar kids in a fantasy world, which is not complimentary.Pros: Good messages. Power of love is pretty cliche, but liking yourself is important. The visuals are stunning. The actors are quite good, especially for child actors. Actually, all the acting is pretty good.Cons: So if this were a movie for adults, the plot holes would be unforgivable. Nothing that happens makes sense and the made up rules don't stick around long enough to be kept track of. Every character trudges along as though the plot fairy has a string tied to them, with no sense of motivation. Again, I get that it's a kids movie but could you at least try to build something resembling a story and not just a bunch of excuses to show off special effects?Overall: Not terrible, but definitely not good."
"86",1,"  Ugh. So bad for so many reasons. Skip it. Save yourself the time, pain, and money..."
"87",0.5,"  This movie ruined going to the movies for me. I have never written a review on rotten tomatoes before but if my review stops even one person from going to see this horrid film, then it is worth it. I used to feel bad about those in the film industry lamenting how they can no longer make money. If you are going to put out this garbage then your industry deserves to fail. Wrinkle in Time is a good book, why not just follow the story line and do less with special effects. The premise didn't make sense, the dialog was preachy and also made no sense. Even my children who watch utter garbage thought this movie was awful. Just the worst movie I have ever seen. When movies cost close to $100 for a family of 5 to go to, they have to be better than this. This may be the last time I take my family to the movies for awhile. This movie just ruined going to the movies for me."
"88",1,"  so pathetic to see people try and defend this"
"89",2,"  Wow, what a bad movie. I've never read the book but I get the feeling that this reads better than it looks visually on film. Beautifully brought to life in terms of graphics but completely lacking any type of coherent meaningful plot that actually entranced and brings you into the world (or universe) they are trying to create. It makes no sense, is boring, rambles all over the place and everything comes a bit too easily at times to our main protagonist whose performance while good isn't great (though compared to Levi Miller's awful performance she's exceptional). To be fair the messages regarding family are good but unfortunately their meaning is overshadowed by everything that is wrong with this movie. Not a good watch."
"90",4,"  Basically the best live action Disney film"
"91",1,"  One of the poorly produced moves I've seen. The little actor playing Charles W. I quite bad. Oprah should stick to doing inspirational speeches. Ware of my money. So upsetting."
"92",3,"  a movie of grand proportions but falls a bit short of expectations - all while spreading the good word of light vs darkness. I personally took away the metaphor of depression. Also, fabulous costumes!"
"93",1.5,"  I'm just gonna keep this review short and sweet, just read the book. This movie doesn't explain about this world and what the hell happens, the only way to know what's happening in the movie is to read the book first. I watched this movie three times, with people with and without knowledge of what has happened in the book, and we all got the same conclusion, and that would be that this movie explains nothing, and does a lot of telling but not showing. I also feel like the first 2/3 of the movie was just rushed, and the character acting was just horrible, however the last 1/3 of the movie seemed like a entirely different movie, because the quality was actually really decent.....although I feel like there was just a lot of filler, which is strange because we they didn't explain a lot or even show the character personality that much."
"94",0.5,"  Worse effects ever. The story line is hard to follow and jumps around. I was excited for this movie ??"
"95",0.5,"  Awful. I really don't know how Disney let this release, I guess they had to? So so bad."
"96",2.5,"  Good special effects and good cast.... but was hard to follow."
"97",2.5,"  The film is wildly ambitious in some areas. However, for the most part fails to take advantage of it's cast, setting, and narrative; missing the mark in every sense."
"98",1.5,"  Disney really came up short with A Wrinkle in Time. There was so much opportunity with no follow through. The worlds that could have been created where endless but the worlds that were created where mundane. Although there was a lot of star power, it could not make up for the inexperienced acting of the three protagonists. This is a challenge with any film relying on child actors, but it was especially brought to light throughout this movie when big emotional scenes were missed due to poor acting.Similarly, the movie missed the mark with the messages it was trying to convey, getting lost in creating nice sound proverbs that main the film feel a fake deepness to it that most children would not understand. I am not a child, so I am not sure how children respond to the film. However, I feel it lacks any true imagination and does not give children anything solid to grasp on to."
"99",3,"  I was finally able to check out Ava DuVernay's film A Wrinkle in Time during a rainy Thursday matinee after several weeks in wide release. At this point, there is not much to the plot synopsis that I can really add. But, the screen presence of Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon as celestial guides speaking of light, energy, vibes and balance help elevate this Disney sci-fi fantasy into an enjoyable and mystical film that left me with a feeling of exhubeation long after the screening was over. By responding to A WRINKLE IN TIME in such an emotive manner, I know there are others as well, so I am completely perplexed why this film has a low rating on movie sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb? The female driven narrative about finding your own light, despite of other people's darkness is a positive message for a younger Disney audience and makes A WRINKLE IN TIME far from a terrible film."
"100",5,"  great movie! cant wait to see it again."
"101",5,"  I am struggling to understand the horrible reviews. I certainly get someone just not liking the movie, but hating it? I actually loved it. I had to step away from the book and take the movie on its own merits. I thought the cinematography was gorgeous and the message beautiful. I'm not sure why we can't just embrace a message of hope and love. We kinda need that these days. The message I took was that the ""It"" - darkness- whispers words of fear and hurt and anger in our ears, and feeds on them. And that we each must overcome our own process of mind to help build light in the larger world. Even as Meg stood facing her brother in the ""darkest of all minds""...you could see the neurons firing, telling her all the worst she had ever thought of herself. She had to listen to the voices of light to overcome those thoughts, and by doing so she could help Charles Wallace win as well. Beautiful, I think. Watching love and courage of self win is not such a bad way to spend a couple hours."
"102",3,"  Adapting a book into a movie is a thankless job. Choosing which details to include, and how to translate the text into film can go wrong in so many ways. Purists will pounce, often rightly, if the movie fails to stay true to the book. This is the crux A Wrinkle in Time finds itself in, and although it has the ingredients for a great movie, the best it ends up being is a good enough movie.People remember the sense of wonder and imagination the novel inspired in them the most, so naturally, that area is A Wrinkle in Time's strongest suit. Director Ava DuVernay does a commendable job visualizing the majestic worlds of the book. While each scene is shot in a real environment, like the redwood forests of California, the more fantastical elements are recreated through CGI. The CGI blends in perfectly with the live action. Unfortunately, it's also up to the audience to imagine where the characters are, as the editing sometimes loses track of them. On a more subtle level, the costume and makeup design convey the otherworldly nature of the adult characters by changing ever so slightly as the movie goes on. What really impressed me, however, was how the characters are framed. Instinctively, you can tell how they are feeling or whether they are good or bad based on how they're positioned in relation to the camera.Although the movie does a good job adapting that wonder, it's attempt at adapting the story itself is a little more mixed. Personally, I thought the book's dialogue was clunky, particularly in the beginning. For the most part, the script updates the 50 year old dialogue, so the characters speak more like modern audiences. Granted, Charles Wallace still gets called Charles Wallace every single time another character addresses him, but what are you going to do about that? The beginning also spends more time depicting the lives of the Murray family and explores their characters, which makes the decision to cut out Aunt Beast's scene later in the film so puzzling. Given that A Wrinkle in Time has trouble pinning down its pacing for most of the movie, it makes sense to maintain the climaxes' momentum by streamlining it into a single scene, but in doing so, the movie loses a key opportunity to delve into its characters and make their story arcs resonate with the audience. It doesn't help that the themes are sanitized of their religious undertones. On the other hand, the message of diversity that takes their place is laudable. Which is a shame, because DuVernay is a talented director, and Storm Reid shows potential as a child actor. Ultimately, though, A Wrinkle in Time is an OK movie when it could have been a great one."
"103",0.5,"  Was not very good, very disappointing to of had so many great actors involved. Just another bad movie."
"104",0.5,"  During the movie, I debated either sleeping or leaving the theatre as a more effective use of my time. Can I sue to get two hours of my life back? There's a wrinkle in time I'm interested in."
"105",5,"  What is wrong with people? This was an amazing movie, that was really faithful to the spirit of the book and hit most of the major, important plot points. It was visually dazzling, emotionally authentic, the characters well-developed, and the plot tight. I loved every minute of it. Plus, they were in giant brain... how cool is that?!"
"106",0.5,"  worst movie of the year (possibly all time). boring cast, almost fell asleep until i died from laughter once they started flying on a lettuce cup and running away from tiny plants while in a very strange dress. first movie i've walked out of in years. this is absolute shit."
"107",1,"  This film should be called ""A Wrinkled Mess."" The narrative is all over the place and the movie tries to rely on feelings instead of plot. The only problem? You're never pulled into the story long enough to feel anything."
"108",2,"  To say that A Wrinkle in Time is disappointing, is an understatement. It was nothing short of a complete mess of an adaptation of a book. It was the classic over-the-top melodrama adorned with the pomp of tiresome lyricism and loud colours, to make up for uninspired, self-indulgent and distracted direction. While it was visually stunning, thanks to amazing CGI support, the story telling left much to be desired. Perhaps directors need to be reminded over and again, that less is more, and good story-telling is far more important than special effects. One long condescending overload of a self-help motivation video on self-worth."
"109",5,"  I loved it, saw it twice. Gorgeous visuals and a touching story about a girl connecting with her dad. The dialogue is real, the people authentic (except for the Mrs. of course). To other reviewers I want to remind them that THIS IS A FILM FOR YOUNG ADULTS so kindly review it keeping that in mind."
"110",1,"  Why is Zachary Galifianakis a wise sage in this movie and why is Oprah Winfrey unenthusiastic about every line she delivers?2/10. Wackiest movie I've seen in my life. I kid you not, it was like a two-hour fever dream or acid trip."
"111",2,"  Unfortunately, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" not only manages to fail of being a faithful adaptation to the books, but it also fails as a movie. It's cluttered, has some pretty horrible CGI sequences, and some pretty poor acting. A lot of them are okay, but it's tricky to have a movie rely so hard on kids, because if their acting is poor, the whole movie will feel that way. And sadly, some of them really miss the mark. It's not the worst movie of all time and it will have its fans, but it's too cluttered and ridiculous to match up to its best-selling source material."
"112",1.5,"  Half-decent performances from some, but generally flat cinematography and a hole-riddled plot makes this movie rather, for a lack of a better word, bad."
"113",0.5,"  This was literally the WORST movie I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time or money on this. I lost $25 and 2 hours of my life I can never get back. I would rather go to the dentist than watch this movie. I really wanted to walk out but I stayed until the end hoping it would get better. It never did and in fact got worse as it progressed. Go see I can only Imagine. That is a great movie."
"114",1.5,"  Terrible pacing, overall felt like a high budget student film"
"115",1,"  Characters don't bring the story to life, wardrobes don't necessarily make the movie."
"116",1,"  Definitely a movie made just for kids. If you're over the age of 12, skip it."
"117",2,"  It was a cute idea but very slow and boring."
"118",3.5,"  This adaptation of a novel from 1962 was simply too short while being too faithful to the original book. This left only three planets, and two major characters. However, if you focus on Meg, the main character, and her journey, and her strength--and discard all connections to the book--then it's a well-acted sci-fi fantasty coming of age story staring a black woman protagonist. Which we could all use more of."
"119",4,"  Worth it. The children enjoyed it. I did as well."
"120",2,"  Great ideas , but soooo long and slow. We couldn't wait for it to be over"
"121",0.5,"  Honestly terrible, full of love yourself speeches to the point of making them meaningless. Also any movie that relies on ""love"" as the means of making something happen immediatly lose credit with me."
"122",4,"  I saw this film at Cineworld on Saturday, and there is rather a lot to say about it.The storyline may not be clever and perfect, but there are parts of the story that are understandable and emotional - and there may be too many special effects, but if there weren't, it'd be a dull and disappointing film, right?I also liked the acting and the unexpectedly beautiful happy ending. Although it isn't as good as Beauty And The Beast, if you like fantasy and sci-fi, A Wrinkle In Time is worth a watch."
"123",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time - Review (2018)The GoodStorm Reid is really goodThe Visual Effects are really goodIts a good message for kids The BadAva DuVernay's Disappointingly Bland Direction, it felt she got lost in the Big Budget it didn't feel like Selma or 13th, and now she's doing another Big Budget movie with New God's I'd rather have her back to smaller projects.The Script is confusing and all over the place that feels rushedDeric McCabe's as Meg's adopted Brother is completely terrible and sadly to say cause he's only a child, but man he's not good, his voice was irritating, here's hoping he's better when he gets older.All the Supporting Actors try their best like Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and Oprah who are fully in the first act then theybdisappear .Chris Pine gets the most emotional stuff, but doesn't really land to elevate a messy script.Gugu Mbatha-Raw , Michael Pena and Moonlight's fantastic AndrÃ (C) Holland are all completely wastedIts very boring The weird humorOverall: This was a major disappointment for Ava Duvernay as I was hoping for a great movie but turned out to be just meh.Overall Grade: D+"
"124",3,"  Too far fetched for me."
"125",2.5,"  Impressive special effects, but a weak plot and superfluous characters."
"126",1,"  Tried so hard to be ""deep"" but I lacked substance."
"127",4,"  A good adaption of the trilogy's first book."
"128",2,"  This movie looked great and had some spectacular moments but was so nebulous and free flowing that the character development fell pretty flat and it was difficult to become invested in the abstract string of events."
"129",3,"  I never quite understand how people rate movies. I didn't want to go this see and assumed it would be bad, but I was wrong. It was fun. It is a movie made for kids and if you go in and just hope for something exciting to watch with a happy ending and a good message, you will not be disappointed."
"130",2.5,"  Amazing CGI, but dissipointed at the end. It didn't have many similarities with the book, and the movie boring at times. Overall, it did not live up to expectations."
"131",1,"  We just went to see ""A Winkle in Time"" - what a waste of time.. I was so disappointed. I can say I believe this is the first Disney movie that left me wanting my 2 hours of time back!"
"132",1,"  Walt Disney must be spinning in his grave. I have never ever seen anything so dreadful in my 60 years plus of movie going! Unbelievable bad direction, poor acting, bewildering script ,passable special effects but the relentless screenfilling close ups of all and sundry had me chewing on the back off the cinema seat in frustration verging on apoplexy. Film is intended to have an effect on the viewer, this sure did three days later I am still seething with rage at such crass rubbish. Bring back hanging!"
"133",3.5,"  Even though ""A Wrinkle in Time"" relies heavily on exposition and is slow moving, it is still a visually gorgeous, inspirational, heartfelt, and emotionally resonant film that benefits from its strong acting performances, touching musical score, and dedicated direction."
"134",0.5,"  The terrible movie didn't even correspond with the book, i hated it and the casting was terrible"
"135",2,"  This movie was visually stunning, however the story was lost in all the glamour. The movie eventually became a bit of a bore. There was clearly a slew of information missing from the story. It was as if the story line came in third to the many stars of the film and the film's Glitz and glamour. I wish I'd waited for it to hit cable."
"136",2.5,"  It was so so. Story was a little weak"
"137",1,"  This movie was absolutely silly and stupid and senseless. rubbish!"
"138",2.5,"  It was alright...Love Realistic Fantasy ...And happy to see Oprah!! ??"
"139",1,"  Thanks, Disney, for ruining one of my favorite childhood books. Some things should stay classic and I believe now the critics who said that the book is not filmable."
"140",0.5,"  Lacking to say the very least, they had a great opportunity to make a fantastic film and they totally fell short. Extremely disappointing..."
"141",2,"  There was a moment in Wrinkle in Time when it showed darkness reaching the Earth and slowly engulfing it. It gave me chills. The movie suddenly felt extremely timely. It may have been talking about a popular girl struggling with an eating disorder and a great student being bullied by his father to do even better. But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios. In fact, much of the film felt as if they were already thinking about a ride as they were making it. My 9 year old liked it. Hopefully it will make him want to read the book. Then it will be worth it."
"142",2.5,"  Fun but slow in some areas."
"143",1,"  This film is a complete disgrace. The 2003 version was a far superior. This adaptation is all visuals and no substance version of this class novel. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is all over the place, and the actors are completely waisted. The only redeeming quality is the visuals."
"144",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time certainly works hard to bring a modern take on the classic children's novel. Although the movie is visually pleasing and has a great cast, the film does fall somewhat flat."
"145",0.5,"  My girls read the books & were excited to see this. In short: SAVE YOUR MONEY & TIME with kids and do something else together. AWFUL!"
"146",0.5,"  This movie is only fit for small children who haven't read the book, because the CGI will enthrall them. Any adults should be ready for an uneven and ultimately unfulfilling experience. Heck, they didn't even truly explain what a tesseract was, and that is the basis for the title of the book! If I could give this 0 stars, I would."
"147",1,"  Colorful,But very boring and Useless"
"148",1,"  Wow, that was bad. No world building at all. No character building. Things just happen with no explanation. An hour into the film and everyone acts like they've already been on this fantastic journey when they've only really moved a few feet. It feels like it was written and directed by people who had no handle on the source material, so they changed it into something they could understand."
"149",5,"  Look, if you go into it expecting it to be anything other than a feel good family film, you're gonna be disappointed. It is a family movie based on a children's book and it did a wonderful job of being that. There are so many people saying basically that it wasn't nitty gritty enough who need to chill. It was visually stunning and an absolute joy to watch."
"150",2,"  This had the potential to be good and had high hopes being done by Disney. The story was confusing and spent too much time trying to impress and not enough time developing a good story. Star power and messaging over a quality movie that did justice to the classic book was a big miss for my family."
"151",2.5,"  They slaughtered this book. Very hard to follow/understand if you haven't read L'Engle's classic."
"152",0.5,"  If you are a fan of the book the 2003 version while not perfect and much lighter on effects is better"
"153",3.5,"  They didn't explain a tesseract or wrinkle in time - the parents occupation was not explored enough which confused my grandson. However, I really enjoyed the movie, it was a visual banquet."
"154",0.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is truly a disappointing mess. Though the actors give it their all, it cannot make up for a lack of a coherent story, or a confusing and generic antagonist. Even the visuals sometimes fail to amaze. Overall a terrible movie."
"155",1,"  Terrible Adaptation. Awful Writing. Bad Directing. Bad Editing. Great Visuals. Painful to watch. Acting was handicapped by poor casting and dialog. Messages were twisted, sub plots were overly brief and messages were shallow at best. Disney had all the resources to make this great and they failed. Major disappointment. Worst movie I've seen in a while. Two scary for little kids(demonic possession, child abandonment) No explanation of science, no explanation of title other than a 3 second animation. Terrible attempt at scientific justification for flying was ""lift"" and for getting picked up and thrown by a tornado - ""physics"". Writers might have attempted to involve a real scientist for the writing. Also these writers should be given an award for worst writing ever. This movie could join ""The Room"" as a cult classic for how bad it is. Looks like the glitter budget was bigger than the writing, editing, and directing budgets combined based on the product."
"156",4,"  I thought the movie was pretty good! Obviously, there were plenty of differences from the book, like the fact that the Murray family has a whole set of twins that were excluded from the screenplay. Whatever, they aren't necessary, especially if there won't be a sequel (which I don't foresee happening). Having read the books when I was younger, Ava did a pretty good job with this film. It was stunning, and the kid in me really enjoyed it."
"157",3.5,"  While the movie has it's flaws, as any movie does, all in all, I quite enjoyed the visuals and the characters. It hit the right tone , in my opinion, of coming of age, and the feelings of inadequacy many teens go through as they become young adults."
"158",5,"  Beautiful story and visually stunning"
"159",0.5,"  Loved this story as a kid and I really wanted to like this movie, but it is terrible. I can't recommend it even if you loved the story as a kid."
"160",3.5,"  Nice story putting a female character at the centre with skills in science and maths but still able to use love to beat hate as she learns to believe in herself and her abilities. This type of message is a good one to put out there to young girls as they grow up and find their place in the world themselves. The special effects will also appeal to younger audiences and look magical if you suspend your disbelief."
"161",5,"  A wrinkle in time was my favorite book in childhood. I thought that the film beautifully adapted the novel."
"162",3.5,"  I really can't remember all of the finer details from the original novel, but I felt this movie hit many of the required elements and themes. Visually, this movie had many well-designed scenes and effects. And from an overall narrative perspective, I felt there was a lot of emphasis placed on making sure the viewer could sympathize with Meg's difficult teenage life. Therein lies the crux of the movie. The CGI spectacles and science jargon are really just background material to highlight what ""A Wrinkle in Time"" is really about - the power of love and accepting oneself to make a difference in the world (not about whether girls can do science too or any other mis-guided view of this movie). Where I get a little hung up on this movie is trying to nail down who is the target audience. Clearly teenagers, teenage girls, and people who read the original novel are the intended audience; but the spectacle level of this movie seems like it is aiming to reach a broader audience. I just don't think the casual moviegoer will get much out of the high-minded physics concepts or the fantastical elements which seem oriented toward younger viewers. And younger viewers are likely to be disturbed by the actions of Charles Wallace and The It at many points in the back half of this movie. To be honest, the movie reminded me of a mashup between movies such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Interstellar, and Spy Kids. As one who formerly read this book I got a fair amount of enjoyment from the movie based on fun character interactions, the inclusion of key elements from the novel, beautiful imagery, and several touching thematic moments which spoke even to me as an adult. I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a movie that explores new worlds, anyone who read the novel, and anyone who enjoys young adult themed books or movies. For everyone else, check it out for a matinee or rent it later."
"163",0.5,"  Gets half a star, only because I didn't actually walk out.but only because my kids were there and they didn't like it either. Was just a poorly executed film from start to finish. I couldn't stand the kid cast as Charles Wallace, nor could I stand the cheesy CGI that was pervasive throughout the film. The constant usage of pop songs throughout actually took away from the scenes after a few times. The writing was terrible as well, it was so cringeworthy I felt sorry for the actors. I read the book a long time ago but didn't recall it being like this. They made the father quite cowardly and I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters. The pacing either dwells too much on a lengthy dialogue full of cheese or just jumps all over glossing over plot. I was shocked upon learning this had a 100m budget. Either they did not use up the budget or 100mil just doesn't buy what it used too. In any case, I think a competent director and screenwriter would have accomplished much more with less. This would have worked out much better as a 1 hour animated TV special for children."
"164",1.5,"  The visuals of this movie are absolutely stunning, and the score is awesome. Chris Pine's acting is also phenomenal and is totally believable. However, that doesn't help save the movie from its many, many, many flaws. I found Meg to be a very unlikeable character (which is ironic considering her name is Meg), all the lore and backstories were uninteresting to me, and Calvin had no purpose is this movie apart from being the token white boy. And Charles Wallace...just...UGH!! I know he's only six-years-old, but I REALLY wanna beat him up. Instead of being cute and intelligent, he comes across as a know-it-all and a really rude one at that. Honestly, one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen. Overall, I think this movie had the potential to be really great, but the plot and the leading roles' acting is what made this movie fall so very short."
"165",2,"  This movie is a waste of time and talent. The concept of time is interesting but the delivery was poor."
"166",2,"  This was just an okay movie. The acting fell flat in so many ways. I was surprised that Disney would ruin another stand alone film after Tomorrowland. The story was rather odd."
"167",2,"  Very disappointed. A favorite book since it came out in 1962. Heavy handed, over-the-top themes. Uneven characterization between female and male roles - and I'm a very strong woman. Messy in general but some stunning photography."
"168",2,"  Probably a good movie if you're stoned"
"169",1.5,"  Just a dull and uninspiring as the book. The actors seemed to have called in their parts, especially Oprah Winfrey. I would only recommend this movie if one needed assistance falling asleep."
"170",3,"  I want a movie to engage me emotionally; make me care for the characters, and be immersed in the story. I felt like Wrinkle in Time made really heavy emotional demands from the start, and never let up. Half way through I was exhausted and desensitized, rolling my eyes rather than tearing up. On the upside, the kids dug it."
"171",3,"  I had high expectations for this movie especially because of the book. Unfortunately Director Ava DuVernay doesn't execute the movie wither her full potential and as a result the overall movie falls short of likableness in comparison to the beloved book.They should of focused more on the characters and the story and explanations rather than the visual effects.Overall the movie isn't as bad as the score."
"172",3.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is an enjoyable, yet somewhat flawed interpretation of the classic novel of the same name. The direction and special effects provide a world unlike any other. This is sure to be a watch for sci-fi fans.The story follows Meg Murry (Storm Reid), a genial teen who is the daughter of famed scientist Alex Murry (Chris Pine). After her father disappears, she goes through a period of insecurity and despair. Four years later, a group of primordial celestial beings - Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) visit Earth to help Meg find her father. Meg's brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and friend Calvin (Levi Miller) also join the quest to find Alex. However, Meg is also brought in to help fight the ""It"", an entity of darkness that threatens to destroy people's happiness. Storm Reid, as Meg, excellently presents her inner struggle to be happy and accept herself and this adds a unique element to the story. As the movie progresses, she slowly rises beyond her doubts to become better. Chris Pine, as Alex, delivers an ardent love for science in his character and, while much of his character is witnessed before he disappears, the rest of his scenes add a performance filled with remorse. Deric McCabe, as Charles Wallace, is my favorite character due to his charismatic performance - full of comic relief. Levi Miller, as Calvin, encompasses a respectful companion who seems to be rather enamored by Meg. Oprah Winfrey, as Mrs. Which, is a wise mentor for Meg who guides her throughout her journey. Reese Witherspoon, as Mrs. Whatsit, is the least wise of the three celestial beings, but she provides a kind companion. Mindy Kaling, as Mrs. Who, represents an encyclopedia of character teeming with knowledge.Ava DuVernay incredibly directs the movie, as you feel as if you are a part of the world through her use of word building to convey a story. My favorite scene is the resolution to the main conflict, as it feels like an appropriate conclusion. My problem with the movie is that is unevenly paced, with the first half of the movie following generic clichés, despite a great first 10 minutes. But the movie gets running as soon as the second half begins, going into uncharted territory unlike any other movie. I also feel that the scenes for Alex and some other plot points are limited, resulting in a few disjointed, convoluted narrative at times and that could throw off some audience members. The message of the movie is about believing in yourself and accepting who you are. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18. reviewed by arjun N., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."
"173",3.5,"  It wasn't as bad as all that. A decent movie for younger kids- Read the book though."
"174",3,"  Not the best Disney Movie. Storyline wasn't that interesting."
"175",0.5,"  I didn't enjoy it very much."
"176",3,"  Everyone needs little bit of Disney - every now and then, in their life."
"177",5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is an amazing movie. It differs from the book in some ways, but overall it's a great movie."
"178",2.5,"  This is an ambitious attempt at creating a classic family film from a classic novel. The visual effects are breathtaking throughout but it seems as though these effects are favoured over any kind of strong story. The plot is almost a secondary product of the feature and any enjoyment taken from the film disappears when you begin to think about what is happening. Storm Reid in particular as well as the other child actors stand out among an array of phoned-in and annoying performances from their elders."
"179",3,"  A landmark film, its resplendent visuals and a strong, emotionally anchored first act fizzle into disconnected second and third acts. Makes bold artistic choices (for Disney) as did the book. Not something I'd watch again but respect immensely."
"180",0.5,"  I have long loved the book ""A Wrinkle in Time"". I wanted to see this film as soon as it came out. It was not true to the book and that fact ruined the movie for me. Religion played a huge role in the book and to change Christianity for inclusiveness was not true to the book. I would not waste another penny nor will I recommend this for my grandchildren to see or anyone. I hope it continues to fail and maybe finally Hollywood will see the need to be true to the character of the book. I won't count on it."
"181",3,"  GREAT MOVIE FOR THE CHILDREN, INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR ADULTS. HOWEVER THE BEST THING ABOUT A WRINKLE IN TIME FOR ME, WERE THE SIGNATURE DRINKS. A GAME OF SUDOKU WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ENTERTAINING"
"182",2,"  Horrible and confusing. Why did this even get made?"
"183",3,"  Visually stunning movie and solid acting but the plot was very simple and really did not take advantage of the depths of the material it had to work with."
"184",0.5,"  tomorrowland 2. golden raspberry for:worst make-upworst costume designworst sceneryworst castingworst tone/moodworst score/soundtrackworst editingworst pacingunbelievable."
"185",0.5,"  Terrible terrible terrible! I was looking forward to this movie after many years of reading the book. Not true to the book and terrible lines (Mrs. Whatsit what has Disney done to you!!!!?) and watered way down for today's generation... devastated! The drag makeup was an awful choice as well. I'm in mourning q_q"
"186",2,"  If people are going to make films from books they could at least do so with out stripping the heart and meaning from it. Disappointed."
"187",1,"  I walked out after a hour ....."
"188",0.5,"  Absolutely terrible film. No substance or story line. And don't even get me started on the special-effects. I expected more from the biggest film company in history. Tsk tskSincerely,A person who wasted $10 bucks on a terrible movie ticket.u"
"189",1.5,"  Liked the flower scene. Other than that its all over the place and not very good."
"190",2,"  two stars for the visuals and the cast only. the rest is a total waste and an insult to a well crafted book."
"191",1,"  Oh, and it was very preachy, too, but with a very silly message that suggested that love can give people the power to do anything- including time travel... although the only time time travel was really mentioned was in the title."
"192",0.5,"  It's like the casting director intentionally cast actresses that half the country can't stand. Then they also cast a girl that has the classic rbf. Then they wonder why it bombs."
"193",0.5,"  the worst....bore bore fest. Did anyone read the book? better called winkle in my wallet."
"194",0.5,"  Poorly done and self-indulgent."
"195",4.5,"  Moments of cheesiness but super sweet, a fantastic meager abd captured the spirit of the book."
"196",5,"  AMAZING storm is my favorite! I love this movie!!!"
"197",1,"  ""A Wrinkle in Time"" had talent in its overall gorgeous look. Other than that, it lacks any noticeable strengths at all.While I sat in the theatre, Disney showed a PSA to thank the crew on such a great project, but after I rushed out, all I could think of is how much of a waste it was to have talented people working on such garbage. My rating does not reflect the controversies with the book, but just the movie itself. A Wrinkle in Time over foreshadowed the future, and there was no surprise that I was looking for. I can see how some people can connect with the Mrs.'s, but I personally felt relieved when they left the screen. As weird as it may seem, I and many others struggled to connect with the lead characters, despite their similarities to many other people. In all, connections were lacking, the theme of the story was an extremely non-risky move, and the rest of the departments in the film struggled to make such a poor idea good. I hope that we can somehow move such amazing resources in the industry to work on stories that we can all enjoy."
"198",5,"  This was an amazing movie, it definitely deserves higher ratings than those which it has received. Extremely moving, incredible actors. I initially was scared that with such a celebrity-heavy cast, the movie might rely too much on the game of it's actors. However, the celebrities that they chose fit very well in their roles, the characters never had to change to fit the actors playing them. The cinematography was fantastic, everything was beautiful and other-worldly and truly captured all of the weirdness and whimsicality of the book. There are not many movies that can move a whole theatre to tears like this one did."
"199",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time is directed by Ava Duvernay and stars Storm Reid, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Levi Miller, Deric McCabe, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Pena and Chris Pine.The story is of Meg who loses her scientist father. He was experimenting with this strange idea he had that you could bend the universe and travel light-years in seconds.When three strange beings arrived in Meg backyard Mrs. Which Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who. Meg her Brother and Friend go off on an adventure through time and space to try and find her father.This is a visually stunning film sometimes and then sometimes it is also fairly horrible looking. There is no escaping it, some of the special effects and green-screen are extremely noticeable and they're not quite as impressive as I think this film thinks they are; especially for a Disney production.There are some very touching scenes most of them involving Meg's family, you really do feel a sense of warmth in their household and when her father disappears you feel for character. But from the first act to the third act the story is such a jumbled mess, it felt like the movie was missing something after the touching opening. That was the human touch, after the first act the film was just really a lot of Wow sequences that didn't really land.When it comes to the Children leading the film all three give good performances for the most part, Storm Reid who plays Meg is fairly good in the movie especially in some of the more emotional scenes, she doesn't really show a lot of surprise when the awe-inspiring moments are happening before her eyes which was a little strange, but she is very good as an awkward young girl who is not comfortable with her own self yet.Her younger brother Charles Wallace started off strong then a lot of focus was on his character neither the end and sadly this is where he fell off.But the over reliance of the younger cast pushes a lot of them to one side, some of them just get one or two scenes in the movie which was incredibly disappointing to see.I think there's a chance that kids today will see this movie and it will be there Hook, Hook was critically pan by critics in 1991, but kids from that era love it. This could be this generations Hook."
"200",1.5,"  This movie did not have nearly as much action as thought while had a very confusing plot"
"201",1,"  A flop that flounders all the way to the end. The little boy was annoying from start to finish. Not much in the way of realizing a story, but there was some potential. There is a good scene with Galifianakis, but the rest is a luke warm mess."
"202",0.5,"  Slow, plodding, muddling, how many more synonyms for moves likes molasses can I come up with. It's a shame really, that such a wonderful classic story came across so poorly. See something else."
"203",1.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time reminds me of The Dark Tower, in that it is a bland, emotionless and totally boring mess. The acting is good and it is nice to look at, but I'd rather do my homework instead."
"204",0.5,"  This movie is just bad. I went to see it to enjoy a family night out which is rare due to my work schedule. With no other choices at the time we saw this movie. The best way to describe this is a mashup of Bridge to Terabithia and Shark boy and Lava Girl. Save your money and if you want to watch it try to find it in a Redbox or wait a year and it might be in the $5 bin at Walmart."
"205",2.5,"  this was fine; i never read the book so i don't have anything to compare it to, but it seemed like a very nice kid-friendly/family movie. the story's weird - i'm sure the book is much better. the cast surprised me, though; lots of big names. when Reese's character kicks the girl i laughed real hard, haha."
"206",1.5,"  I really wanted to like this movie but in the end it was just a huge disappointment"
"207",1,"  Visually very colourful and sometimes awe-inspiring, but definitely a case of style over substance. With a weak plot that descends into nonsensical tripe and some bizarre character choices, the film ends up being too weird to be engaging, with things being weird just for the sake of it - the costumes are a prime example. The moral messages and acting are ok, but otherwise, it's a disaster."
"208",0.5,"  A combination of horrid CGI with lackluster music, combined with god-awful acting and a terrible plot, makes Disney's ""A Wrinkle in Time"" one of the biggest faliures of the year."
"209",2.5,"  Plot was pretty messy. It has a great message about self confidence and positivity, but overall it was mediocre. The colors, CGI, costumes, and make up were fantastic. It madethe movie for me. Not horrible, but not great either."
"210",2,"  I expected more story elements to this film, I guess I was watching too many of their trailers lately that I've been knocked out into their unclassical motives. It's like the opposite of Doctor Strange"
"211",2.5,"  It starts great and for some reason it looses its storyline and gets rushed."
"212",0.5,"  This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen In my entir life I would not recommend this to anyone. Complete waste of my life"
"213",0.5,"  I have never snuck out of a movie.... until now. Worst movie ever."
"214",5,"  My daughter and I loved this film. My daughter loved it so much that she wants to see it a second time!!"
"215",1.5,"  Slow paced and preachy."
"216",0.5,"  Don't watch if you read and enjoyed the book. Low budget Disney movie with bright colors."
"217",0.5,"  I really wanted this movie to be good. Unfortunately it was anything but. The 0.5 point I gave was for some great characters but the story and ideas in this movie were just ridiculous and made not sense at all. The storyline was all over the place and I feel that no character achieved anything in this movie. Worst movie I've seen by far."
"218",3,"  Love time travel? Love classic literature? Love ripping on bad adaptations of stuff? Well today, ya might get to enjoy all three!A WRINKLE IN TIMEIn all honesty, I never read the book, so I had to familiarize myself with the plot kind've on the fly. It was ok, little dated, but entertaining. As for this new adaptation...At less than 2 hours, this film moves at a pretty steady pace, but MAN is it a head trip! (Pro tip: never watch this film on acid or even weed!) I did feel like I was missing a chapter or two of the story, even though we got the whole beginning, middle, & end, it was still a bit hard to wrap my head around. Pretty though.It's been a while since I read up on the story, so IDK if the film is 100% book accurate. But honestly, it was pretty entertaining.The cast were all well chosen & acted the HECK outta their roles. The three guides, the kids, the adults, the background characters, it was like the film was Dr Pepper, & you could see how each flavor fit into & improved the whole. The villain was non-traditional, the evil that is & must be part of the universe, which was an intangible threat, but you could feel it in your spine, which made for some pretty good unsettling moments.The visuals were (& I'm dead serious) a bit too acid trippy for my taste, but not bad. You could tell what was CGI, but that only added to the trip, along with some (I kid you not) practical glitter effects that REALLY added to the trip. This film would've fit right into the '60s & '70s Disney era.The music was an ok mix of contemporary songs; didn't add much, but it didn't take anything away either.Over all, I'd call A Wrinkle in Time weird, hard to follow, but never boring. 3 stars outta 5, some would argue it deserves more, BUT...that's why this is MY humble opinion, not everyone's humble opinion.PS. When it comes to time travel, I...think I'll stick with a Delorian or Tardis, less headaches."
"219",0.5,"  Did the screen writers ever actually read the book? And what about the make-up staff...were they all taking hallucinogens or just most of them. An absolutely awful portrayal of perhaps the greatest children's book of the 20th century."
"220",0.5,"  This is the 3rd time I've tried to post a review for this awful movie. Save your money, it's screenplay-bad, acting-hammy, CGI-good."
"221",1,"  An overwrought, confused mess with tons of plot holes. It tried way too hard and fell flat."
"222",1.5,"  It may have some really cool shots sometimes, but for the most part it is only really bad CGI. But my main problem with this movie is that it is really, really childish."
"223",0.5,"  Horrible! Disjointed! Horrible acting by top actors; that takes effort."
"224",1,"  This movie sucks. Harp o can't act. Reese W was lame and KELLI from the office was miscast. Cheesy special effects. Captain Kirk seemed like he mailed his performance in. What a wast of money which will probably make my annual pass price go up because of all the money Disney wasted on this crap."
"225",4,"  I do not understand all the negative reviews. I watched it in theater with the kids and enjoyed it. I think the criticism towards Oprah is unfair. She had a small but important role and she did full justice to the character. Same for Reese Witherspoon. She was fine in her role. I have not read the book so cannot compare. But did not find any portion of the movie boring."
"226",1.5,"  This is not one of those ""the movie is not like the book"" kinda thing. I didn't like it, and friends who didn't read the book didn't like it either. I wasn't expecting anything from this movie and I still got disappointed"
"227",1,"  I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I wanted to give Disney a chance with this material. Sadly, it just didn't work. Heck, Disney already made this movie once before, a TV movie that's honestly much better than this."
"228",1,"  Should be retitled to ""A Waste of Time"""
"229",0.5,"  I'm so confused how this is even considered a movie. What a mess of a movie that makes no sense at all. I feel like it's more like a 2 hour example of what it would be like to be on drugs."
"230",0.5,"  The worse movie of the year. Save your money. I have never read the book but I know I had to survive this 2 hours. The kid actress is very good though."
"231",1.5,"  its liike putting b cliche with greaat visuals"
"232",0.5,"  Absolutely awful movie but took my 10 year old daughter who wanted to see it. Not even worth a free showing as you will be robbed of your time."
"233",0.5,"  Hideous metamorphosis of a beloved book from my childhood to something completely distasteful. Why does disney insist on adaptations filled with political messages. Just entertain us."
"234",3,"  i give this a solid 3 stars. remember this is based on a kids book, do dont treat it like even a young adult novel. accept it for what it is and enjoy the ride"
"235",0.5,"  This was a made-for-Disney-Channel--kids-reruns-on-Netflix movie that somehow made it to the theaters. What bag of dog vomit!"
"236",0.5,"  Dad was not a coward in the book. poor dad gets turned into a coward in this poorly done adaptation). the message is peculiar. He is saved by courageous daughter. I struggled to understand why she did not chastise him for his cowardice. this was a poor plot choice for a childrens movie. I gave it half a start for visual effects. Reese witherspoon and oprah were very funny in their roles."
"237",5,"  I think this movie captured the serious struggles we face on a daily basis. The dynamics in characters were impeccable - inspiring, and heart warming. The ""it"" they speak of in the movie proves mass consciousness, with Stephen Kings ""It"". There is an evil force that proves jealousy and anger etc that spreads across the world. The reviews on this movie is a pure example of this It that is taking over man kind. This movie was GLORIOUS and to everyone involved - job well done. This movie made me cry, laugh, and hug my loved ones tight.I LOVED it. The best lesson I learned is stay true to yourself, and love is the biggest weapon. Embrace your faults, always be kind."
"238",2.5,"  Saw the movie last night....I'm glad I read the book first. This modernized version didn't help tell the story at all...and in my opinion detracted from the true nature of the book and the wonderful story I remember reading. It's just another case of too much superficiality...and blatant disregard for content."
"239",0.5,"  Awful movie, sad too see such a good book trashed in this way."
"240",0.5,"  Made an account just to say how terrible it actually was. No part of this movie resembled the book. Emotional scenes were fake and boring, the acting was miserable. Don't waste your good money on such an insult to a beautiful book."
"241",0.5,"  Seriously, this movie almost made me puke. But I was a good dad and took one for the team"
"242",2,"  My 8 year old liked this movie. The rest of us did not. It is very Disney, by which I mean more Disney at their worst (their execrable TV shows) than Disney at their best. It is saccharin sweet, with no depth at all to make the saccharin tolerable. The studio has sacrificed story in favor of excessive and over-the-top special effects. It had its moments, but the adults in our party were disappointed at the oppurtunity to render a classic kids' sci fi well, and the decision to turn it into a schmalzy, special-effects, and terrible pre-teen music extravaganza."
"243",0.5,"  Never read the book, so I'm not comparing. But I'll never see this movie again.."
"244",1,"  Bored out of my mine!!!!!!! Stupid director and stupid disney!!!!!"
"245",0.5,"  You know when your gut instinct tells you ..nope waste of money...like wrinkle in wallet.."
"246",3.5,"  Good movie, but I have some concerns about it. The costume for Mrs. Who was a bit overexaggerated because of the eyebrows. Also, the battle between possessed Charles Wallace and Meg could've been a bit longer. Still, the movie was exciting, but also mysterious..."
"247",1.5,"  A dull, Disney-fied version of a book that should have been wonderful when put on the big screen. While there was certainly some good acting throughout, the romance sub-plot felt forced and turned the whole thing into a very traditional Disney film."
"248",1,"  Thank you Disney for trashing one of my favorite childhood books. Anyone reading this, the books are amazing, but this movie was too bad for words. I hope Disney stops with this movie and doesn't try to make any of the sequels. I'm getting very tired of their directors inserting all their politically correct agenda into classic stories."
"249",5,"  It was okay but book is the best but This one is kind of not that bad when this movie come out a blu ray and dvd l going to buy it??"
"250",3,"  Some classic teen fantasy novels were never meant to be adapted. Better to get the book and share it when the time is right. Then find this retelling long after digesting the print version. You'll see why, and be glad of it. Or just tesser on your own! We all can, in a manner of speaking."
"251",2,"  two stars for the part of the story they got right: the tiny bit from the book, when the kids go to Camazotz to retrieve Professor Murray and ending with their return. About 20 authentic minutes. I was abnle to get past the obvious miscasting (the Murrays are all red-headed as detailed more in the ensuing books), but not the costuming mistakes (all of the Mrs' are very ragtag on Earth because they don't belong). My biggest disappoint was all of the added adventures, at the cost of the genuine ordeals already written; which are exciting enough for a film in my opinion. Another favorite book series ruined by its film. I really wish that filmamkers would actually read the book they are attempting to create on screen."
"252",1,"  Disappointing. Poor movie making. I have a lot of grace for movies with a good message, but this was hard to watch."
"253",0.5,"  Total crap. I want my 2 hours back! Disney, you are slipping big time!!!"
"254",1,"  Oprah is fabulous in all her glory, and so is Storm Reid cast as Meg in all the horrible situations she's forced to endure, but the movie fails to convey a clear story, and completely misses a key part of the original story in its rush to get Meg and company home. Look no further than the Wizard of Oz as an example of great adaptation in the same vein as Wrinkle in Time. WoZ involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch. So, my thoughts: cut the special effects gimmicks, return to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.Good try, but really....."
"255",1,"  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE"
"256",1,"  This should have been so good. Instead it felt like the editor was tasked to remove 30 minutes of plot, so closed their eyes and picked at random. Yet they left in the scene where Reese Witherspoon turns into a flying piece of kale. This unfortunately ends up being one beautifully costumed, well acted mess."
"257",2.5,"  It was alright for adults, but children would probably enjoy it more."
"258",0.5,"  Painful to watch, cliche' acting/lines, Everything is flat, the kind of mellow music that tires your mind throughout the movie"
"259",1,"  Another movie in which the best parts were shown in the previews. I came out wishing that I had not wasted the price of the ticket."
"260",2.5,"  Solid performances and vivid imagery doesn't make up for this poor crafted adventure that leaves nothing but a facepalm."
"261",0.5,"  This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Nothing in the movie is redeemable. The effects are good awful, the acting is atrocious, the music makes my ears bleed, and 99% of the movie is shot with these ugly downward facing shot that make an already ugly movie uglier than sin. Stay far away from this movie."
"262",2,"  A Wrinkle in Time does contain some impressive visual, but storywise it is very incoherent. Sometimes it comes off as a string of unrelated scenes edited together. The acting is very bad, for the most part. Storm Reid actually does do a good job in her role. The characters aren't very well fleshed out. Calvin, in particular, just randomly appears and serves no further purpose to the film. He just tags along. The message was great, but I wish they took a more subtle approach. Instead, they beat you over the head with it. Ava DuVernay seemed to have good intentions her, you know what they say about good intentions. Unfortunately, this film does not deliver and is a huge misfire. Can't recommend anyone see this film."
"263",5,"  This film is everything I had hoped an updated version of Wrinkle in Time would be. I'm only a little sad that Auntie Beast was cut out but I can live without her."
"264",1,"  What a waste of time."
"265",0.5,"  It is a made for TV movie with a big budget"
"266",3,"  Visually stunning, but it felt like it was missing a crucial element in the development of the story and characters."
"267",4,"  Heartwarming. Great family movie with a good message about self-love that's important for girls. Some of the scenes felt a little clunky but Storm Reid gives a great performance. Oprah feels typecast as a towering wise figure and while I know this is an adaptation from a book, the dialogue and character development leaves much to be desired."
"268",2,"  There's no denying the importance that this movie may have for some audiences. The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.I walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.I've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.There are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.4.0/10"
"269",1.5,"  The only reason I'll give this film a star and half is because of its strong acting and amazing visuals. Other than that, this film was a major disappointment. Not only is it dull and empty, it completely takes away from the majesty that was Madeleine L'Engle's classic. From taking away religious/Christian references, to taking out some of our favorite characters, and most of all, Ava DuVernay's adaptation also hurts when she decided to take out one of the best lines in the book. Mrs. Who's advice to Meg before going on the journey. Not only did Ava ruin one of our favorite kid books, but she also destroyed all of our hopes for a great spring blockbuster. Congratulations Disney and Ava DuVernay, for messing up one of the greatest kid fantasies of all-time."
"270",2,"  Not worth seeing! I had high hopes for this move, but ""A Wrinkle in Time"" was a big let down. The movie was confusing, disjointed, and filled with outlandish scenes that did not mesh well. My 15-year-old daughter had read the book and was excited to see this movie, but was unfortunately utterly disappointed with adaptation to the big screen. The cinematography and soundtrack were great; not much else was. I would give this movie 4 out of 10."
"271",0.5,"  Storm Reid's performance is compared to Christian Slater's performance in ""Mobsters"", which means that this movie is yes, that this movie is as bad as the 1991 movie ""Mobsters"". I'm not even going to get into how bad Reese Witherspoon was in this film."
"272",2.5,"  I see what their going for but none of it lands because of the overt CGI and the one note characters. Reece Witherspoon turns into a giant CGI flying lettuce leaf and thats the most character defining trait she has. Everything in the movie looks great but feels hollow because the emotional beats are to hammered in. This would have been a better animated movie, some of the dialogue and writing is very cringe worthy but might have been saved by animated characters. ."
"273",5,"  it is a movie for people that like the universe and the power universe"
"274",3,"  the movie was great but it screwed the book over and was nothing like how great the book was."
"275",2,"  This movie was often visually interesting--but that's IT. The plot didn't really hang, and they worked way too hard for some overdone themes. I am as woo-woo as the next 45-yr-old liberal, but I COULD NOT STOP my eyes from rolling the last 20 minutes or so. LITERALLY COULD NOT STOP THEM, even when I noticed my my hormonally-wracked pubescent teen girl actually CRYING, so I honestly tried, out of respect for her. I gave it 2 stars because Oprah is an automatic half-star, the visuals were great, and, well, my daughter liked it."
"276",0.5,"  Do yourself a favor and read the book. Disney really needs to get their stuff together. fIRST lAST jEDI, THEN bLACK pANTHER AND NOW THIS TRAIN WRECK. iTS LIKE dISNEY ISN'T EVEN TRYING ANYMORE. hALF A STAR BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T TRY AND TIE THE TESSERACT INTO THE MARVEL UNIVERSE SOMEHOW...so there's that."
"277",5,"  Loved it, and we need more films like this that are empowering and hopeful. Go to the light!"
"278",1,"  Horrible movie, just horrible save your money! I got up and left after 30 min."
"279",3,"  The beginning kicks off and fly's into action! Then crashes to the ground half an hour later..."
"280",4,"  I don't know why this movie is getting such low audience reviews. I found it to be charming and it stuck to the ideals of the book, even though it's not *exactly* replicating everything that's in the book. It's not too scary of a movie for elementary age students and is entertaining for adults as well. As an educator who loves this book and often reads it to my upper elementary students, I liked the movie a lot. Folks, get past the ""Hollywood names"" and focus on Meg and Charles Wallace and their story and fight against evil."
"281",1,"  Poor acting and dumb effects."
"282",0.5,"  Inept and tone-deaf tinkering with a beloved story. Plenty of very talented actors misdirected through a mess of awkward transitions, poorly paced dialogue, improperly acted responses, and mis-cut scenes."
"283",5,"  Powerful, beautiful journey of a young heroine. A refreshing alternative to the violent battle fare offered to kids. My 12 year old son and friends loved it."
"284",1.5,"  Visually stunning, but the story is so hacked from the book that it ends up making very little sense. Some characters seems to just be along for the ride because they've been stripped down so far while others have changed so much from the book that they end up seeming to contradict their own nature. One character cannot speak in her own words...right up until they couldn't find a quote that suited the situation, and she just starts speaking for herself.They would have been a lot better off not trying to purge all the Christian elements of the book."
"285",1,"  If you need a good 2 hour nap this film is a good choice."
"286",2,"  I liked the young actors and Reese. You could see where they spent $100 million on special effects. Mindy and Oprah's roles were less impressive. There was one scene where Oprah and others are offering ""gifts"". There was one scene where Oprah and others are offering ""gifts"". I fully expected to have Oprah's character to give a car to the young actress (and everyone in the scene). By the way, I had not read the book"
"287",1,"  One of my favorite childhood books turned into a glitzy, politically correct cartoon. Very sad."
"288",0.5,"  A book that relies so heavily on the readers imagination is undoubtedly difficult to put to film. Many times people, when speaking of adaptations, claim that the source books are always better than the films. In this case it is very true. Wrinkle In Time must be translated through the minds eye, it is only in that field of view that it can be great."
"289",1,"  More trash from disney... dont bother and stick with the classics."
"290",0.5,"  A true Green screen extravaganza!If you like cgi, then you will LOVE this movie!"
"291",2,"  I found the drama to be over the top. The little boy becoming a monster personality was disturbing and horrible. The heady PROPHESYING was ridiculous. A boy gets dropped to his death basically and some flowers catch him at the last second......ok, that could have been cool except for the fact that it didn't scare him in the slightest when he basically thought he was going to become a human pizza. I was literally squirming in my seat bored and bothered. The graphics were cool for some of it. I liked the flying woman scenes. Too much anger for me though"
"292",2,"  Visually captivating but falls short in all other respects. Storyline was oddly dark for a Disney movie, definitely not one to bring younger children to. Pass on this movie, way too many other good movies worth seeing."
"293",0.5,"  Slow to begin and the over far to quickly. Poorly paced, could of such a better movie. The young actors where good and have potential, kid who plays Michael Wallace is creepy and familiar"
"294",1,"  A cosmic turd thru time and space"
"295",0.5,"  Unfortunately Hollywood and Disney keep relying on hiring directors who love identity politics and keep pushing to influence the younger generation with these concepts. They destroyed Star Wars and I think before I ever go see a Disney film again I will wait until the audience reviews are in to make a decision on whether I should spend money on a ticket."
"296",5,"  Awesome! I loved it. I saw it with my sister and my niece. They loved it too. We intend to see it again."
"297",5,"  I really enjoyed this movie, I really like the acting throughout the movie, for example when one of the misses was being sarcastic. That was funny."
"298",1,"  This movie is a total no-go. If you want to waste 2 hours of your time on this mess of a movie, go for it. Little to write about, simply dry performances and hard to follow twists."
"299",0.5,"  I thought that A Wrinkle in Time was a total complete fail!!! They were missing the Meg's twin brothers. Just because the twins didn't have a important role doesn't mean not to add them in the movie. I wasn't really a fan of the makeup I think they weren't focused on the main reason of this story. I was really looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time?? Don't waste your precious time and money on this horrible movie. I rather watch Black Panther or stay at home and watch the wall than spend my money on this BAD! movie??The actors were good but the some of the special effects were unrealistic??"
"300",5,"  I love this movie. Is it corny at times? Yeah, sure. But it's a DISNEY movie FOR KIDS. The cast is wonderful. It was healing to see that many people of color and that many women on screen. Can't wait to go see it again. & again."
"301",2,"  Was kinda entertaining but there were just so many things thrown in there that left me confused. This movie would have been better served if it were much much longer. So many possibilities but it just felt rushed and disjointed."
"302",2,"  A great book turned into a mediocre movie. Sure, the visuals are excellent, but the plot falls flat on it's face for most of the movie."
"303",5,"  Really liked, it was visually appealing and with an amazing story. I liked how the movie is about finding happiness and believing in yourself. I cried the whole movie."
"304",2.5,"  Visually beautiful . Storm was a Gem, I had hopes that it would have done better. The Cast was amazing , and Disney has always stole my heart. I just couldn't seem to become that excited . It lost me a few times and even with such a cast, I couldn't rate this higher than I had hoped to.."
"305",2,"  While not unwatchable, ""A Wrinkle in Time"" fails to live up to the hype and high expectations set out for by flashy trailers and an all-star cast. Though visually stunning, it feels as if too much information is trying to be crowded into two hours, while upon conclusion, it also seems as if very little has happened at all. If you're a fan of the book or are looking for a feel-good action, sci-fi, and coming-of-age crossover, you may very well enjoy ""A Wrinkle in Time"". Personally, I found the corniness a little too much to handle and would not recommend seeing this film unless you're looking for something to fit exactly those criteria."
"306",5,"  Visually stunning and highly entertaining"
"307",5,"  This movie was exactly what I wanted, a heartfelt, gorgeous movie filled with diversity."
"308",1,"  This movie was just plain awful. Crappy special effects, terrible acting, unrealistic dialogue, and a story that was predictably cliche to the extreme. It didn't help that it was also chock full of social justice themes and buzzwords to make it even more cringey. There was literally nothing redeeming about this movie."
"309",2,"  It's a rather rudimentary adaption of a book that is anything but. While the film lacks the tone and messaging that makes the book unique. Rather than a whimsical sci-fi tale, they settle for a cliched fantasy retelling of the plot, and on a whole it feels rather uninspired, Perhaps there was too much focus on external circumstances of the film (the director/main actress/oprah) and less on the substance of the story. If a faithful adaption is what you were looking for, look elewhere. If another ""Find yourself"" fantasy family film is what you want, this sort of scratches that itch."
"310",2,"  Truly terrible costumes, horrible acting except by the kids."
"311",3,"  The best aspect of this film for me was the dynamic between the main girl and her father. I also enjoyed the relationship she had with her younger brother. this movie had some really heartfelt moments among the family and overall an intriguing plot. However the execution wasn't the greatest. there were times throughout the film where i felt lost and bored. This can be attributed to the pacing and filling in gaps. I also felt that Reece witherspoon (whom i am a fan of) and Mindy Kalling were over acting and it came off as corny and annoying at times. I do believe a lot of audience members and critics might be a little too harsh on this one as i did enjoy myself. But there was definitely something missing that stood out and kept me from giving this movie a better rating."
"312",1,"  As an adult viewer, it was boring and extremely confusing and many of the story lines did not connect. I think a lot of the visual affects were to cover a very flawed movie.. My grand daughter was afraid at times, amused at others and bored. I was deeply disappointed."
"313",0.5,"  HORRIBLE. Not at all like the book. The characters aren't even fully developed and there is no reason to care about them or their journey. If you've read the book, don't see it. If you have a child who wants to read the book, don't take them. Waste of money!"
"314",5,"  I have a 13 year old daughter and I am so happy that I took her to see this. The messaging for young girls is amazing. Cast is great."
"315",1,"  it wont let me give it a bad review"
"316",0.5,"  I cannot remember the last time I wanted to actually walk out on a movie at the theaters. The acting was terrible, some of the visual effects were lacking, and it was just lazy. The writing was plain and boring and the music used during the film hurt the movie instead of helped the experience. Save your money. Don't see this mistake by Disney. If Oprah can act better than the kids chosen, Mindy whatshername and Reese Witherspoon, you know it's not good. Chris Pine was good, but barely in this female-filled garbage."
"317",1.5,"  Saw it on Fri.. really wanted to like it.. but the motivations of the characters vs their actions didn't flow.. I don't know how the book is.. but as the movie by itself.. it was was really poorly written.. with story and plot holes all over the place that just made me wish I hadn't taken my boys to it."
"318",0.5,"  Worst Disney movie I has ever seen! I would say it's too dark for any children. The movie was hard to follow and understand. I would not recommend it at all!"
"319",0.5,"  Unfortunately, this movie is terrible. The script is weak, the acting is poor, and it is a otherwise a complete mess. It wants to be profound, but fails at every turn. It tries to throw in some pop culture references to seem hip, but they all fall completely flat. It tries to develop chemistry with the characters and to create emotional involvement, but comes nowhere close. Quite frankly, by today's standards, it isn't even that much to look at. I certainly wouldn't call it gorgeous. Aside from a few costumes, the aesthetics fail to deliver. In all, this is an extremely disappointing Disney effort. Tomorrow Land looks monumental in comparison to this misfire."
"320",0.5,"  Just awful. I don't even know where to begin, so I won't. Hopefully, this will inspire the people who wasted their money watching this to go grab the novel and truly enjoy this classic story, which was just horrifically brought to film."
"321",4.5,"  It was a great movie. I focus on its plus, there are bad parts, but it is amusing."
"322",2,"  The book was somewhat preachy. This heavy-handed movie takes great special effects and cute actors and has them dully learn preachy lessons even more than the book. Boring.I think the lesson I am supposed to learn is that by studying math I can find the frequency to wish myself to other planets and join the fight against the spreading evil darkness."
"323",0.5,"  The movie is very unique, but those unique is the downfall of it fame. Wrinkle in time by its name is realy very catchy name and also made people wonder. But the reality is differ. Disney is known to create something wonder. But this one is not, more i can say its boring. Event though the movies cgi effect is realy a wonderful touch, the background of the movie itself is not that wonderful. More like simplify background because the budget went to the effect and their actress i think."
"324",0.5,"  Worst disney movie ever."
"325",0.5,"  Took what the book had and turned it into some sub par believe in yourself bull."
"326",2,"  Not a favorite. Too much talk, not enough is shown."
"327",5,"  It is a children's movie. The Quantum Physics is mentioned and I hope adults will investigate some of the terms, like ""frequency"" that have lessons for adults. I enjoyed the quotes and theme of the show."
"328",1,"  Horrible. Feel ripped off. Was like watching a made for TV show. Kids were great actors tho."
"329",1,"  Worst movie of 2018. Save your money. Stay home and stream something or cut your toenails. It would be much better than this movie, which is nothing but a sound stage and a bunch of crying actors hugging each other. They didn't even try to do the cherubim from the book."
"330",0.5,"  I had no idea what I was getting into. I saw ""Disney"" and figured it was a safe bet to be a well put together and entertaining movie. Now I'm trying to figure out what was worse, the hurried clunky storyline that just felt like the director was checking off a to do list of scenes, the B flick level acting or cheesy makeup and effects. This may actually be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel like Disney owes us an apology for this monstrosity. Skip it and take the family out for a bunch of dental work or maybe spend 2 hours shopping in Walmart. These are more pleasant ideas than sitting through this ""film."""
"331",5,"  Good movie. Close to the book - not a disappointment.."
"332",4,"  Really enjoyed this movie and my daughter did too!"
"333",0.5,"  The worst written, acted and produced movie I have ever sat through (I was there with my wife who doesn't share my opinion or I would have walked out). Seriously, my vocabulary lacks sufficient negative terms to describe this movie. It was brutal."
"334",1,"  A watered down plodding version of the book."
"335",3,"  The movie started off slow, and when it finally hit momentum it was an underwhelming ending."
"336",1,"  I've never seen anything this messy before. Everything just does not make sense."
"337",5,"  It is visually breathtaking, emotionally stimulating, touching, & most of all FRESH, FRESH, FRESH! How nice to see something different than a cookie cutter script and film. A must see."
"338",3.5,"  Fun Movie to watch with family. My daughter read the book in school and also really enjoyed the movie. Better then most ratings that I heave read previously."
"339",0.5,"  Don't waste money on this movie. Nothing to like."
"340",1,"  Won't let me write just how bad this is. Oh well"
"341",3,"  I've seen movies before where I haven't read the book and I still knew what was going on. This is not one of those movies"
"342",5,"  Expressive. Inclusive. Thought provoking. We have so much potential. We only have to look within ourselves and find the key to unlock it. Sometimes we need something greater than we are to show us. A Wrinkle in Time is a must see for families."
"343",5,"  I don't understand all the haters! This movie was awesome. Strong female lead beautiful diversity. Uplifting! Inspiring! Stunning costumes and cinematography. A classic story of love conquers evil."
"344",5,"  This was a great spin on my favorite childhood book. It has great messaging for youth, especially girls. The cast did a great job! Everyone should enjoy this movie with their kids!"
"345",2.5,"  A Wrinkle In TimeInitial Reaction: Time's really shows its age.Main Characters Meg Murphy, Calvin O'Keefe, Charles Wallace: Three kids played by Storm Reid, Levi Miller and Deric McCabePlot Summary It's been four years since Meg's father vanished, and she's not dealing with it very well. She's shut herself out from others and other kids and adults don't show her much sympathy. But soon three magical women show up and they tell Meg that her father discovered a new way to travel to places that are a long way away. However he gets stuck in that stuck in that distant place for the past four years.  Meg and her brother, Charles - along with a friend, Calvin, rush off to a strange and far away land to find and rescue him. On the first stop in their journey, the women tell our heroes about a creature called ""the It"" (note: not Pennywise). This dark mass of ... stuff threatens to turn humanity against itself using mind control and persuasion. But Meg isn't leaving without her father - even if she has to face her greatest fears and take on her biggest challenges.SCORINGMain Characters These three are okay. I like Meg a lot because she really has trouble keeping it together after daddy vanishes. But the other two felt really bland in comparison. I would've like a better explanation as to why Calvin comes along on this trip. SCORE: 6Supporting Cast The three magical ladies have some flair to them - but they're only good in short bits before they get annoying. Good thing they bow out of the film early and let the kids shine. SCORE: 8Plot This film would've been better without the action sequences - like the tornado scene or the beach scene. And some of the tests really don't make sense - like the taste the sandwiches test. SCORE: 3Originality This film has the making of an interesting twist on a sci-fi, psychological movie, but some parts just felt flat - like when Meg finds her father. SCORE: 5Violence Factor The last scene has Meg getting physically beat up by the It. It would've been better just to keep it all in her head.

"346",2,"  2 Star Review:Years after her father's disappearance, Meg Murray comes across three celestial beings, who have traveled the universe to help Meg, her brother and her classmate find her father. A Wrinkle in Time is definitely a sight to behold. Throughout the film, the audience is treated to a visual spectacle with panoramic grandeur. At times, the film shines through to deliver to us the message of accepting oneself regardless of what flaws we think we may have and using that power of self worth to overcome the obstacles in life. The film, however, ends up trying too hard to convey that message and it doesn't help having the 3 celestial beings dressed up the way they are with all that makeup which adds a layer of campiness to movie that otherwise wants to be taken seriously. The acting is distracting during certain key moments along with clunky dialogue. While the film is to be commended for aiming high with such a powerful theme, it doesn't nearly reach the heights it was aiming for."
"347",5,"  Although very right-brained, and moving at is own leisurely pace, A Wrinkle in Time brings back a sense of childhood wonder I haven't had in years. The acting is impressive, and Evil Charles Wallace is downright hardcore! This movie deserves much more respect than it's getting."
"348",5,"  Absolutely incredible"
"349",0.5,"  disney is LACKING I mean straight trash ever seen Jessie ended like now they have the worst shows that keep on air !!!"
"350",1,"  HORRIBLE! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! HATED IT! very over rated, very loud, very predictable & almost scary for Disney. Would not take any kids under the age of 12 to see this movie! Very confusing in my list of worst movies i have ever watched. Do not recommend"
"351",0.5,"  I'm sorry to say this was not a well done kids movie. I couldn't believe Oprah - with the very cheesie makeup especially the eyebrows with XO . Her name is Witch? I did not like the Satanic undertones for my grand kids."
"352",5,"  Good message and good movie to see with your kids. Cosmetologists will enjoy the hair, makeup and costumes!!"
"353",1,"  Awful... just awful. The CGI of characters was absolutely AWFUL... the scenery was good. The costumes were good. The acting was subpar. The pace of the film was the WORST! The most movie-made-from-a-book-that-you-won't-understand-or enjoy-unless-you've-read-the-book- multiple times, ever."
"354",1,"  What a horribly boring movie....Please save yourself and do not see this movie. Its like all these actors forgot how to act. The acting is so humdrum so non believable. The movie just never takes off you never get that feeling of going on this epic adventure. ""I want my money back."""
"355",1.5,"  Terrible commectivity and a weak storyline. Like an after school special, but less interesting."
"356",5,"  The central themes and diversity were my favorite parts of the movie. It was a magical movie that I think will never lose it's relevance,"
"357",4.5,"  Such a good film. Definitely deserves at least 90%."
"358",0.5,"  Dont waste your time on this piece of crap...it sucks."
"359",2,"  Thought it tried very hard, but did not connect with me at all. It was a gorgeous movie and I really wanted to like it, but I left the theatre very underwhelmed."
"360",2,"  Visually great, but plot seemed rushed. A lot of plot holes, and some character issues..."
"361",1.5,"  A Wrinkle In Time was an adventurous book. Of course, when they called the book unfilmable, they didn't lie. In fact, this movie was nothing other than a worthless cash grab. Though visually stunning, this movie has so many aspects that caused it to become one of the most mediocre movies that the mouse house has ever brought to theaters. Many important parts of the book were cut out in the final film, including my personal favorite character, Aunt Beast. The film also was very choppy, and left you to imagine what was actually happening a majority of the time. To be honest, most of the movie was made of emotional moments. This took away from the whole adventerous spirit A Wrinkle In Time was supposed to have. And as a plus, most of the acting towards the end was so shameless that it felt as if the actors were mad that they participated in this mess themselves! I'm ashamed that I was excited to see this movie, to the point that the whole time I was sitting there watching it, I wish I could wish I could wrinkle it."
"362",0.5,"  Waste of time.... worst movie I have ever seen"
"363",5,"  Such a beautiful movie that only adds to the book. The central message of love and facing what makes you afraid will resonate with both children and adults."
"364",3.5,"  Not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this movie! I am glad I don't pay attention to ratings. The movie had a great message, kids and adults alike should be able to relate and find things to love about this movie. Pass on the reviews and decide for yourself."
"365",2,"  Though beautifully costumed, and with gorgeous ""set"" design, unfortunately it does not serve to tell this epic story above the level of dull. Plot and action are mostly skimmed over for dialogue a child could have written, and an excess of examining the feelings and emotions of the main character that are fully understood within the first 10 minutes. Disappointing."
"366",4,"  Glad I did not read any of the bad comments before seeing this movie as it was better than what many are saying it is & has some very good teaching points which most likely just went way over these bad reviewers heads!"
"367",3.5,"  A good movie. Beautiful. Sad. I liked it."
"368",4,"  Very masterfully created but some of the main characters became flat very quickly and that was a little hard to watch. I would like to point out that a female director was behind this and her vision and visual perspective can through onto the movie itself. It's essence was feminine, and I mean that in a good way. It is very refreshing. Another refreshing aspect of this film is that it's target audience is not towards little children, but not explicitly adult content and sex and whatnot. This movie is, in my opinion, quite a jewel with it's message and how it conveys it. The editing and direction is very unique for this day and age and I am glad to have been a part of this time in history."
"369",0.5,"  THE WORST FILM. I HAVE SEEN"
"370",3,"  The film falls short for adults who read the book in the 1970s or 1980s, but not for its updating of references (""Daaang. Tucker. American""), but for leaving out some of the complexities of the book's plot. The film does a good job in emphasizing family connections and love, and a decent job of making ""faults"" an acceptable aspect of one's self. For kids, it is visually appealing and has some thrill. All that said, something didn't quite come together...it sought to be visually stunning, but wasn't inspiring at the same time, which seems to miss the mark. No matter what, this is an incredible performance by Storm Reid! Reese was expectedly quirky and Oprah maternal/grandmaternal, if not only because she and Storm could--by appearances alone--well be related. Deric McCabe is endearing and believable as a precocious Charles Wallace. All in all, see it, but if will be a movie you see only once or twice. Better in the theater than at home."
"371",1,"  The best part is simply being at the theatre, smelling popcorn, and chilling for a few mins before the previews end. First time in a while I haven't minded taking a bathroom break during a show.. what is it with Hollywood these days?"
"372",0.5,"  What a visually gorgeous catastrophe of a film. I'm so disappointed."
"373",5,"  Loved the movie. Didn't understand that shock that it is a kid's book and therefore a kid's book."
"374",3.5,"  An okay movie in its own right. The acting was far and away its best quality, especially the child actors (whose roles were pretty difficult). The special effects were pretty but overused, and much of the original story was changed in order to show off more of the visual effects. That's the main problem--the story was altered so significantly that it's a poor adaptation, and the meaning of the story is changed, too. If you haven't read the book, the movie won't be a disappointment."
"375",2,"  The best part of thr movie is the graphics and that to a degree. Plot is weak, actions is almost non existant. Science fact are minicule. I waist my money in the movies on this. More desapointing that the last transformers. Dont see it. Rent it. Becouse movies like this is why people pirate the movies."
"376",4,"  I have to give 'Wrinkle in Time' a B. I really enjoyed this movie! I thought it was cute and inspiring. The beginning was the movie was okay but once we got to meet Oprah's character, I think that's when the movie turned into a good direction. Oprah was the winner in this movie. The visuals were spectacular; from the costumes to the hair to the makeup to the beautiful images of flowers and greeny. It was just visually stunning. I liked the fact that this movie really focused on believing in yourself and being a warrior in your life. It's a message that everyone needs to hear nowadays. The only downsides to me was the beginning of the movie cause it was a tad slow and I did not like the little girl's brother. He was just way too annoying to me but overall, it was really good film. It's sad that all the critics really panned this movie because it has so much good things in it. I would recommend it and see it again."
"377",1.5,"  Visually stunning, but besides that, loaded with awkward chemistry."
"378",3,"  Could have been a lot better."
"379",1,"  Good actors, Good visuals, NO soul"
"380",0.5,"  THERE WAS So much CG that I COULDN'T EVEN IMMERSE MYSELF INTO MUCH! IT WAS HORRIBLE AND VERY MEDIOCRE. THE ACTING AND THE STORY WAS SO BASIC AND BORING!"
"381",4.5,"  I just saw it, and I loved it. There were a few minor flaws, but they rarely took away from the film. Overall, my favorite part was the cinematography. There were many beautiful shots during the film, and the landscape was absolutely wonderful. The CGI in this movie was absolutely amazing, and I'd recommend anyone to see it for these alone. The movie did have flaws, however, as many of the characters were given very minor roles in the movie. There was also an issue with Calvin's jacket, the garment disappearing and reappearing every so often. There also wasn't much leading up to the battle between the 'Big Bad' and Meg. Although the movie had its flaws, I would still consider it amazing. I just wish that they had gone into more of a backstory with Veronica and Calvin. 10/10 would see again."
"382",1,"  Waste of money, read the book instead."
"383",2,"  Okay, so this movie is a mess. Its visually stunning-sometimes- but it rushes through the story so fast you could not probably comprehend on what happened. Plus, the characters aren't given time to really develop and sometimes their changes are too sudden. And finally, in my opinion, it is waaaay to cheesy 9/10 times."
"384",0.5,"  Painful to watch such a bad movie. Hope the book is better."
"385",1,"  what book was this based on????"
"386",0.5,"  nice feel good relative theme ,decent acting by children characters.yet so many gaping story holes and reliance on Cgi rather than better believable performances parrs played by o reese and others ? So much of the movie dedicated on the kin of demonic and negative focus geesch if this movie was made for kids made to give them nightmares.Did they make this film on a shoestrings glitter and pixie dust because maybe if they would have it could have made a much better film ...Disney you could have done much better. The film is a waste of money hence why ticket sales are dying because of lackluster films with better film projects coming from netflixs and streaming sources."
"387",0.5,"  amazing by 2018 they havent seen enough flopping moronic movies not to make another one. prooly written and directed. acting ok. ruined the story. waste of time, don pay to see it"
"388",0.5,"  Probably the worst movie that I've watched during the past decade, my daughters hated it. Would not recommend."
"389",0.5,"  This movie is terrible. Acting, story, plot, nothing makes sense,. I can't think of any movie worse than this one."
"390",3,"  Enjoyed the movie but still left feeling somethings were missing , I answered. The Mrs. Costumes were over the top, but great CG effects. Sadly, these effects took over and the story itself was pared down, if not actually dumbed down like do much these days. Went home and rewatched the original 2003 movie and and it was soooo much better. Deeper and introspective but not more than most kids could understand. Yes this versions Charles Wallace was way cuter, in fact this movie was way prettier and glitzier than the first. Like so much in today's culture. All glitz and glamour and little to no substance. In 2003, there was plenty if substance. Three stars for an adorable Charles Wallace and pretty, colorful sets . But for substance and a story kids will grab onto, find the older version. Our kids are smart enough not to need a colorful piece of fluff."
"391",1,"  Difficult to follow. Poorly related to book. Visually appealing. Too focused on delivering a social message."
"392",2.5,"  It followed the book ok, but it lacked something. Some of he visuals were neat and the ending was well done."
"393",2,"  Saw it, slept thru at least 20 minutes of it, Only reason to see it is to watch Chris Pine and Levi Miller, and Zach Galifianakis gave a good cameo."
"394",2.5,"  15 years ago, when the original ""A Wrinkle in Time"" came out in 2003, the author, Madeleine L'Engle, knew that it was going to be bad before the negative reviews came out. Now with Ava DuVernay's adaptation of this ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" I seriously don't think that's going to change her mind about this, (if she was still here). The film is more underwhelming than 2012's ""John Carter"" and 2015's ""Tomorrowland,"" and the results are a weird mess. It's very easy to see that DuVernay did the best she can by bringing this classic novel to the big screen, but there are numerous of problems that are impossible to ignore.The film focuses on Meg Murry (Storm Reid), an outcast who lives with her mother, Dr. Kate Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who you may recognize her from the critical acclaimed episode of ""Black Mirror"" and most recently, ""The Cloverfield Paradox""), and her intelligent brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Four years ago, Meg and Charles Wallace's father, Dr. Alex Murry, (Chris Pine) has disappeared without a trace, and Meg's been feeling nothing but pain, sadness, and doubt after that. Later, she, Charles Wallace, and their friend, Calvin O' Keefe (Levi Miller), encounters three mysterious travelers, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and lastly Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and together they travel through different planets and universes to find their father.Let me just break down the problems with the film. The first problem is the soundtrack. I have admit to myself that I really like ""Pete's Dragon"" for its performances and the heart of the film, but if there's one complaint I have with the film, it's the soundtrack. I thought some of the songs don't seem to click in the film, and even I said the same with ""Suicide Squad,"" which its soundtrack was one of the real reasons why I hated the film. The soundtrack in ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" (which features new songs by Sade, Demi Lovato, and more), is nothing to be impressed. I'm not saying that the songs are bad, but they don't seem to work with the film.The second problem is the special effects. While some of the settings look pretty colorful to look at, the CGI effects, for the most part, looks unimpressive. The first time you see Oprah Winfrey as a 30-foot tall woman is really strange, (which I will explain more about the performances later). Then, there's a particular moment where we see our main characters have landed themselves on a planet, and we see flowers flying around; it reminded me of something in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" (which I'm not a huge fan of that movie). Next, you see Reese Witherspoon transforming herself into a flying creature, and it's, once again, very strange to look at it. I would say there were a couple cool moments when it came down to the special effects, (which both of them happened near the end of the film), though.The third problem is the way how they developed these characters. I thought the introduction of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which felt silly to me. Back to what I was saying about Oprah Winfrey, I find myself uncomfortable when I see her as a giant in this film, (although she wasn't always like that in the entire film). I'm not saying it's a bad performance by her, but it's definitely not her best one in my opinion, (even though I do like her in general). As with Meg and her family, they're actually quite possibly the best part of the film. The interaction between Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as husband and wife is nice, and so does the interaction between him and Storm Reid as father and daughter. It's just a shame that the film doesn't offer more insights on these characters.Storm Reid is terrific as Meg. She delivers every soul and energy in her character, and the way she performed onscreen is mind-blowing. I seriously cannot wait to see more films that have her in it. Some people, (such as Chris Stuckmann), have criticized Deric McCabe's performance as Charles Wallace, but for me I thought he was okay. I mean, watching him (spoiled alert) playing the dark side of his character, (which it happens near the end of the film), isn't perfect, but I do think he's got talent nevertheless. Levi Miller (""Better Watch Out"" and ""Jasper Jones"") does his best, but the film doesn't give him that much to do when he was playing the role of Calvin.I would have had a better experience with ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" if the story and characters were properly done. Or maybe if I didn't read the novel, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I do think director Ava DuVernay is a wonderful filmmaker, and I like what she has to say in all of her movies, but I think I prefer if she keeps making more movies like ""Selma."" There are so many things I can't ignore in this film. The story is messy, the pacing is inconsistent, the editing is choppy, the writing is flawed and uneven, and the execution, (especially when it pulls out its message about love), feels flat and unconvincing. My full opinion: 5.1/10."
"395",2.5,"  I hate to diss on one of the greatest movie production companies of all time,but this review deserves what it is about to get. As Charles Wallace from thefilm adaption would say, this movie is very much so not good whatsoever. The three main characters (Meg, C.W and Calvin) were underdeveloped andmisused to make for a jumbled messy story that makes a little sense after.Chris Pine did nothing to add to this film, and there was too much giant Oprah Winfrey in the sky. I would stick away from this one until it either popsup on Netflix like a lot of other Disney movies, or just forget about it altogether."
"396",0.5,"  I was expecting science fiction and got a sugary mess of whimsy and love-conquers-all rainbows wrapped in the thinnest layer of science fiction terminology. skip it and break your foot with a hammer instead. it will be more fulfilling."
"397",5,"  I liked the movie very muchI think the story is good and all the actors are wonderful in terms of acting and formI loved this film and also was concerned about it because of the wonderful actors in the film"
"398",0.5,"  Watched A Wrinkle In Time today. It was literally the dumbest, most infuriating movie I have seen in my life up to this point. I was expecting science fiction and I got a cut-rate childrens movie that was mostly rainbows and childish whimsy wrapped in a tissue-paper thin layer of sci fi terminology. There is not a single character that I did not hate within five minutes of their introduction. I laughed at the big villain moment because I am not intimidated by five year olds. Itd a movie that attempts to be inspiring and insightful when it has nothing more to say than 'The hippies were right, love solves all the worlds problems'. I can't recommend it on the visuals because the only good visual effects scene was at the end of the movie and the rest of them look like they were done by interns. I can't recommend this movie to parents because the moral of the story - if you can call it that - is that if you just love hard enough, Daddy will come back and the bullies at school will be nice to you.For the love of God, capital G divine one-and-only God, do not take a child to see this mpvie. No child deserves to have this inflicted on them. No child needs even the barest hint of the thought that they can make Daddy come back or make solve other complex real-world issues just by loving at it hard enough, because if yiu convince a kid that and loving at it doesn't work, wellI guess that means you didn't love Daddy enough/I guess you're just not loving enough to be treated with basic human respect.I have a habit of being hyperbolic and exaggerating to make things more amusing but here, now, for thebfirst time in my life I am genuinely just this pissed off at something. I haven't been angry like this since I was in fucking elementary school. Fuck this movie."
"399",3,"  I was so excited to see this movie and almost fell asleep. I was so sad about this reaction. Visually, it was lovely, though."
"400",3,"  I love all things sci fi and was eager to see this movie. I enjoyed it overall, but was disappointed with various elements. #1 the treatment of Calvin. I kept asking. what about Calvin? And Oprah's costumes were awful. Totally distracting to me. Kids will probably like it."
"401",4.5,"  This movie is perfect for older kids. It is full of wonder and curiosity. The ways it diverged from the book were well done and I was pleased with many of the changes. It is inspiring and thought provoking. Saw it in 3D which was well worth it ??."
"402",5,"  I can't believe all the negative reviews! This is a disney movie based on a young adult novel. If you've read the book, this is fun to see. They left out some scenes I would have loved to see included in the film, but that's how any book adaptation goes. This movie is visually stunning and it's not perfect, but for goodness sake it deserves a better rating than it currently has. Down with the haters."
"403",5,"  awesome concepts to life in message"
"404",0.5,"  ""A Wrinkle In Time"" was a classic book, beloved by a generation. Oprah and her coven of PC fellow-travelers have forever ruined this classic with their inability to entertain instead of delivering a leftist sermon. A flop. A pile of crap."
"405",2,"  two points just for the special effects... all the plots are just throwing at you, audience feels no emotional connection with the movie. Also, lots of meaningless close-up shots."
"406",1,"  I remember reading this book as a kid and wanting to get to the end so bad to see how it ended. That is the only similarity I found with this movie. It was so bad, i could hardly wait until it ended."
"407",0.5,"  I haven't read the book, but judging by other reviews i can agree that this movie fails ti deliver. Lots of cringy and confusing moments, horrible antagonist, and boring characters that could've have more background told but in the end just they just left bland. Only good thing about this movie is it's gorgeous visual, yet bad camera angle and strange close up moments ruined it for me. For a Disney movie, its very disappointing."
"408",5,"  This movie is awesome watch it at first you just think umm what is happening but then wow"
"409",5,"  Beautiful and inspiring movie - I loved this take. I'm not surprised that most critics are white folks and men. It was odd to be the only one who chuckled at the Outcast quote in the totally full theatre - until I realized it was 99% white folks and in a rich neighborhood. Thank you for this excellent movie, Ava Duvernay and crew, and if some folks don't like it, well, too bad for them. My daughter and I loved it."
"410",0.5,"  It has some interesting moments...but a lot of the movie is very scientific and it never really introduces a plot besides the fact that Meg is looking for her missing father...and then the plot twist in a very scary way that I wouldn't want a child to see it's just very nerve wracking and I double checked the rating twice while I was in the movie! My rating is very low, but I did love the three Misses they were very unique and interesting!"
"411",1.5,"  I tried posting a review of this when it came out but it would not post, I posted a review of another movie no problem, what gives are you trying to protect this movie from its inevitable bad reviews?They cut the relevance out of this book to movie adaptation and ruined it in the process, it was also very boring there was a whole section of things that the cinematographer must have thought looked cool, it served no purpose in the film"
"412",0.5,"  This movie was awful....."
"413",0.5,"  The low-budget 70's sci-fi look to the costumes was not nearly as distracting as the acting and after-school-special quality."
"414",2,"  Oprah is fabulous in all her glory, and so is Storm Reid cast as Meg in all the horrible situations she's forced to endure....and Charles Wallis not bad either. But you can't make up for the fundamental flaws. The movie fails to convey a clear story, and completely misses a key part of the original story in its rush to get Meg and company home. An example of how this movie could have been made? Look no further than the Wizard of Oz which is an adaptation of a book, involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch.Cut the gimmicks, and back to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.Good try, but really...."
"415",4,"  Excellent movie Well done"
"416",0.5,"  Not what it was hyped up to be, bad camera angles. Odd visuals, needed a new directions. Do not waste your time, go see black panther again instead of this. Mad love to the actors but no, just no"
"417",4,"  LOVED THIS MOVIE! Confused as to why people say it isn't like the book. I just read the book and it's very similar - even better than what my imagination could conjure up. Oprah is a goddess in this movie. The entire premise is so incredibly important. I plan on going to see it again!!"
"418",3.5,"  Loved the book(s), really enjoyed the movie."
"419",1,"  By removing key items from the book's story (not the least of which being all references to Christianity) not only did it lose reason, it also lost a good portion of the book's fan base."
"420",1,"  This film is a nightmare with terrible plot and poor acting from the female lead. If it wasnt Levi Miller, I had given it 0 star, Levi acting and character is the only reason i even bothered to give this trash 1 star. Seems like Disney has invested all their time and good team to Black Panther and other Marvel movies. They didnt have time to make an other proper movie."
"421",0.5,"  Horrible waste of movie making would be too kind. Sorry Ava! The script was lackluster, acting sub par and overall boring."
"422",2,"  A Wrinkle In Time is, unfortunately, my least favorite Disney movie so far. It's clear that the director had big ambitions to be visually dazzling, emotional, and wildly entertaining and for most of the movie, it fails to be any or all of those things."
"423",2,"  Could not imagine how Disney screw up such a concept full of potentials. I watched the trailer and thought it was fascinating, so I went to see it despite the reviews. Yep, it is that bad."
"424",0.5,"  This was absolutely a waste of time. This movie jumped around so much that it has to be one of the most difficult movies to follow for anyone who has ever had the pleasure of reading the book. CGI alone will drive you mental. The camera angles screw up your eyes, I don't recommend sitting anywhere but the back row this movie or you will get sick. You must have to really enjoyed the book to fork over the cash to see this. If you want to have a fun drinking game, drink every time someone says the word universe, father or CharlesWallace. Seriously Charles Wallace as in one name the movie waste about 20 minutes of our time with that name alone. Charles Wallace come here, CharlesWallace I love you, CharlesWallace don't do that, CharlesWallace CharlesWallace CharlesWallace CharlesWallace. If you seen the trailer to this movie, you've seen the movie. There is not much else going on. One of the biggest problems is the ending by which it takes 10 minutes to wrap everything up standing in the kitchen. Extremely boring movie. Read the book you'll get more out of it."
"425",1,"  Went into this pretty excited. I was actually keen to watch it, until about halfway through once the acting started on a downwards slope with a plot that felt empty, an antagonist that felt like it was on screen for about 5 minutes and a giant sentient lettuce head that appeared once and was never seen again. The best part of this movie was before ""Tessering"" came into play. Also the ""Shut up Meg"" line that felt like it was straight from family guy."
"426",4,"  Great visuals and good messages espoused for adults but especially for kids. Yay for positive films!!!"
"427",2.5,"  I went to see this movie with my Mother because she remembers reading the book when she was quite young. She is legally blind in one eye, so we couldn't see the film in 3D. I think the film may have been relying a little too much on the 3D element, because I did not feel like it was anything special. I am glad to see such strong females leads and look forward to seeing Storm Reid in more films to come, however, I would not want to see this film again."
"428",0.5,"  This movie seemed way too rushed, and just had no explanations for anything."
"429",1,"  It felt like we sat in the seats for four hours. That's not good. The acting was horrid, the themes overplayed. Oprah was horrible. Mindy Kalings winking after every quote was super cringe inducing. The character Meg was just...so bland. The screenwriting was atrocious. Please don't waste your money or your time, even when it comes to iTunes. It is that bad."
"430",1,"  This was a slow , confusing and boring movie. Definitely not a small Childs movie. The acting was stilted and characters were silly. They never did explain how the father and male friend returned and the ""It"" was unbelievable. This was the worst Disney movie I have ever seen.!!!"
"431",1.5,"  Very sad to have to say this movie was underwhelming, Sorry Oprah and Ava I really wanted to love it."
"432",3.5,"  Do not listen to the critics. This was a good movie. Beautiful and wonderous and the cast was excellent. Special kudos to its young star Storm Reid, who brought a tear to my eye. Yes it is a childrens film so bring that child like wonder when you see it. Yes there were also some holes and did not follow the book exactly but that is to be expected in a movie interpretation. I hope to see more movies like this with girl leads in the future and I want to see more from DuVernay."
"433",4,"  this is sweet movie that have you rooting for the girl"
"434",1,"  Terrible movie that tries too hard to be this empowering movie with bad CGI."
"435",2.5,"  The costumes were excellent, and the messages were good. However, the movie dragged in spots and was difficult to follow. I took my 12 y/o and 15 y/I granddaughters and they both enjoyed it but expressed that it was disjointed in spots and hard to follow. Not for young children."
"436",1.5,"  In this baffling narrative feature follow-up to her 2014 hit ""Selma,"" director Ava DuVernay trades socially resonant thematics and solid performances for what's basically a couple hours of infuriating logic vomit. Both movies do have Oprah in them, though, that's for sure. It's honestly been a long time since I've seen such an immeasurably dumb, narratively tone-deaf movie backed by a studio with such confidence. There's such an impossibly small amount of sense in this story that it's actually hard for me to believe some sort of snafu didn't happen between the Disney executives and the creative minds at hand. This might just be 2018's living embodiment of ""biting off more than one can chew."" So many ideas, yet no consistency or care to explain any of it. Yeesh."
"437",1,"  this movie was so boring. Disney must have been hard up for cash so they chose some nobody as a director because it was very very poorly directed. My daughter wanted to see this movie so I took her to see it and after a half hour she was texting on her phone. We saw 6 or 7 people walking out and we did the same. just because it has good special effects does not make up for the good awful direction this movie had. The director should never ever have another job as an director again.! worst director ever, the book was 1 million times better than this move."
"438",0.5,"  worst movie of the year"
"439",1,"  Very disappointed in a weak, pathetic adaptation of an excellent book. ThE NEW AGE QUACKERY AND POORLY WRITTEN SCRIPT, NOT TO MENTION THE MEDIOCRE ACTING MADE THIS A BORE TO WATCH."
"440",1,"  Bad movie, fell asleep"
"441",0.5,"  Disapointing, director sub-par."
"442",2,"  This film was a pretty big disappointment. Right off the bat, the audio is not mixed well. I was trying my hardest to listen to the dialogue but there was blaring music in the background. Next, the story was just not up to snuff. Endless plot holes and overall unbelievable performances across the board. Mindy's character had no depth. Charles Wallace was unbearable. He had a line or two that made me chuckle but on the whole, he was very obnoxious -- perhaps intentionally, but it made me dislike anytime he was on the screen. Some people hated the visuals but I actually thought they were some of the better parts of the film. It's world-building outside of the Earthling reality and it was cool to see this imaginative world. If only the story came together in a coherent, organized way with a believable script. Recommend others watch this when it hits Netflix."
"443",0.5,"  Absolutely the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to sit through nothing like the book the first hour seems like it took four days to pass absolutely worst direction of any movie ever made I'm Serious it made the worst movie ever seem like an Oscar movie stay away at all cost"
"444",0.5,"  One of those movies where you have to leave to prevent any more torture."
"445",1.5,"  Confusing and unclear story."
"446",0.5,"  I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE, BUT FOR ME IT WAS A FAIL. TO MANY CHARACTER CHANGES, OR ALTOGETHER OMMISSIONS. SOME UPDATES WERE NECESSARY TO KEEP CURRENT WITH THE TIMES BUT CHANGES TO mRS WHATSIT CHARACTER AND HOW THE w'S INTERACTED WITH THE CHILDREN WERE A FAIL FOR ME. ALSO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE LESS CUT OUT OF AN ALREADY THIN NOVEL."
"447",0.5,"  This movie is so bad I do not have the words to adequately express my disappointment. I am uninterested in commentary that 'the book is the book and the film is the film'. In fact, that is the kind of group think trope that the book rails against. it was clear this movie was more about Hollywood's agenda than accurately representing the story written. by Ms. L'Engle. My position is that if you don't want to do the book on film, but want to use the characters, fine. buy the rights to the characters, write your own story and make a movie. DO NOT name the movie the book. of course, it would rob you of the opportunity to entice lovers of the book into your theaters, but it is the more honest approach."
"448",1,"  Worst remake ever. I don't think the director even read the original book or movie. Everything was so so bad. I have been waiting for the remake since I saw the poster last year and I was so excited for mindy and Oprah but holy crap. The angels sucked (image staring up someone's nose) and there is ZERO magic. Ms whatsit (Reese Witherspoon ) was a snotty bitch. She was nowhere near a mystical timeless being."
"449",3.5,"  This movie is actually a fun adaptation of the books and has a lot more heart than many other recent family movies.It is a shame that places like rotten tomato have become the platform of group trying to sway their agenda on everyone by downgrading movies just because it doesn't fit their needs or believes.People don't be influenced by this, watch a movie and make your own decision and enjoy them for yourself.And for those that are downgrading movies because of racial hate or because it doesn't fit you right religious agenda sorry to say but need to get a life"
"450",0.5,"  It should be titled ""A Waste of Time"". Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Every aspect of this film was poorly done. It's a shame really. There was potential to create something amazing. Should have hired a director that is worth a damn."
"451",0.5,"  Nothing like the original book. Apparently the Christian references were not sufficiently inclusive. Oh by the way, I am neither male nor white and I still didn't like the movie."
"452",5,"  I have some reviews and my point of view is what reviews are considering to be ""faults"" I believe are the strength of the movie. I believe this to be one of those novels that is extremely hard to adapt into a movie, but I think they took the essence of the book a produced a wonderful movie. So Wrinkle in Time I gift you your faults."
"453",1.5,"  Looks and sounds like a boring movie."
"454",1,"  Yuck! The story was completely changed. Key parts that contributed to beautiful lessons and character development were eliminated. Random scenes were added in that took away from the experience. #Butchered"
"455",0.5,"  Disgustingly cliche while being of low quality with many plot holes, which is a bloody shame since I was looking forward to this movie."
"456",0.5,"  In no way measured up to the beautiful L'Engle book. The main character was stiff and boring. The screenplay eliminated the most salient elements of the story. What remained was trite and empty of the profound message that makes this children's book a true classic."
"457",1,"  waste of time. no redeemable qualities."
"458",3,"  While clearly aimed primarily at children and with numerous faults, Wrinkle in Time is still a beautiful film both visually and emotionally. Being a father who has at times been lost myself I was able to identify with the narrative despite it being clumsily delivered."
"459",0.5,"  What did I just watch? I want my money back."
"460",2,"  A lifeless collection of characters makes this seem about 5 hours long. I think that there are a ton of missed opportunities here. I had hoped for better from DuVernay."
"461",0.5,"  As a moviegoer, I am not hard please. However, I haaaaated this movie, as did my mom, brother, and husband who were with me. It was incredibly boring, and the story made little sense. I also found pretty much all of the dialogue to be absolute garbage. It was like the writers did some mad libs, and just filled in every blank with ""The Universe"" or ""Love."" I could not roll my eyes hard enough for this movie. I did give it a half star because I liked some of the visuals."
"462",5,"  I thought this movie was amazing. I cried through the whole movie. Maybe you have to be, or have been, a sad 12 year old girl to appreciate this movie. Having been that girl, this movie hit me in the GUT. I thought it was beautiful and uplifting and meaningful. I don't really understand why this movie is getting so much flack. Can't a movie just sometimes be lovely and fun and joyful? 5 out of 5 stars from me though!"
"463",1,"  The only magic in this movie is the sheer desperation in publishing it regardless of the many many cliches in this movie that people had seen dozens of times throughout film histories. No originality here."
"464",0.5,"  probably the worst disney movie ever!"
"465",0.5,"  the movie, ""A Wrinkle In Time"", was to me, and very disappointing one. Starring Storm Reid as Meg Murry and Levi Miller as Calvin O'Keffe, I found myself in a tornado of dispointment and grief. That is metaphorical because I referenced to the tornado of bad-ness (which i found politically incorrect due to the ebony color). I found this movie vitriol to the soul, leading me to suicidal and self-harming thoughts. These emotions were brought up by the fact that the main characters did not smack lips. The result of missing the interlocked lips, i concluded a lower rating i would perceive that this movie is deserving of.I am in deep aungish and am in search of a mental hospital or family theripist close to the area around the tesserae due to the deep wounds cut in my flesh from the film. The promised lip - intertwinement i deserved was never offered or given. For the following reasons, i come to the conclusion of a half star rating on the film ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and i caution you to watch at your own risk.Consider what has been said,Edwarda P. SnardChief Director of Fancy Movie Rating Incorporated (TM)"
"466",0.5,"  Absolute terrible movie"
"467",1,"  It's scarce bit of charm isn't enough to have you overlook its lazy narrative agenda, lackluster visuals, and outright boring plot. Big disappointment considering its source material."
"468",3,"  An adventure that spans from the imagination to the ends of the universe with a message of positivity that slightly obscures the point of the original children's classic."
"469",0.5,"  i made a rotten tomatoes account just to give this a 0.5 star rating. grossly underwhelming and immensely disappointing."
"470",2,"  I did not enjoy this movie. The acting was not good and it did not keep me intertained. The end of the movie could not come fast enough."
"471",5,"  I really can't understand the whole rush of negative feedback this movie has received. It's a movie targeted at children, supported by a cast of tremendously talented women. It's moving and magnificent."
"472",0.5,"  The book was better , the movie cut out so much.."
"473",1,"  Must have a real story, cannot just check off items on your PC checklist. That might make a director feel good about how "" important"" the movie is, but it won't sell tickets. Ready Player One will wipe this mess off the map."
"474",5,"  i loved this movie VERY much it was amazing"
"475",4,"  Ignore the critics and Super Reviewers and go to a movie to have fun. It's a great movie, especially for young girls. To all the adult males reviewing it..why? We don't want to hear your opinion on something you can't appreciate!"
"476",0.5,"  This was pathetically casted and overall bad storytelling. This was a CGI pukefest and I want my money"
"477",2,"  Hubby and I saw this on the first day. I had no idea about the plot of this other than I have read other books about Meg. Aside from the elaborate costumes and special effects, there were plot holes. Special effects were WAY overdone and at times, hubby and I were wondering what about the people that you just left?"
"478",5,"  This is an excellent add up Tatian to one of my favorite childhood books. My 17-year-old daughter who is currently studying physics, where's glasses, and has hair like me, fell into my arms and wet she said, ""mom I felt seen"" my nine-year-old daughter ripped off for 3-D glasses when it was over and yelled that is the best thing I've ever seen in my life!. My friends kept trying toMy sons kept trying to decide which one of them was Charles Murray. Bravo Ava and all of the cast and crew!"
"479",0.5,"  the kind of crap you'd expect from Oprah."
"480",2.5,"  I saw it and don't need my money back or anything, but I don't see watching it again anytime soon. Multiple obstacles are rushed through so there's no barely any tension, especially what I see as the best scene in the movie that's largely shown in the trailer. Children are creepily bouncing balls in unison and for a moment the movie becomes more interesting, however the length of the scene in the actual movie is barely extended from what is shown in the trailer. Multiple times, the tension dissipates as fast as it appears.Far from the worst movie I've seen, but could have been much better."
"481",1,"  saw this with my wife.. OMG.. so hard to follow, sloppy editing and the acting was soso. Would not see this again."
"482",1,"  I was excited about this movie but was really disappointed. It was really boring and I had trouble even staying awake. I want my money back!"
"483",1,"  It's discouraging that's not very good, given what an evident, palpable desire project this is."
"484",1,"  This movie should have a different title, it's absolutely NOTHING like the book. Rotting garbage is accurate"
"485",0.5,"  So completely divested from the book that the only true ement it shares is the title. Simply, a bad movie done poorly."
"486",1.5,"  Underwhelming. It had fun colors and big actors but it was really meh. The story was dull, boring, and SPOILER ALERT I hated that they turned the little boy into a villain. It has an empowering message but I was really disappointed with the execution of the movie."
"487",0.5,"  What a confused mess of a film. This borders on an in name only adaptation so fans of the book will be pissed. I wish I could get the time I wasted on this back."
"488",1,"  It didn't work. At all. My daughter was confused. I was disappointed. I expected some real feels in this movie. Instead I kept thinking: ""when is this going to end?"" Terrible. Flat acting. Story seemed compressed to death."
"489",0.5,"  Sadly, another lost opportunity to bring a great story to life-a huge disappointment brought about by inept and tone-deaf tinkering with a beloved story. Plenty of very talented actors, well cast but misdirected through a mess of awkward transitions, poorly paced dialogue, improperly acted responses, and mis-cut scenes, all telling a jerry-rigged story that lacked the depth and power of the original book. It's hard to understand how the executives let this go to screen without serious repair."
"490",0.5,"  I was so excited for this movie. But it was terrible. I fell asleep at the end. It was poorly acted. Poorly written. And the flow was just off from the beginning. Awful film. Only movie in the last 5-10 years that I wish I hadn't paid tonsee in the theatre."
"491",5,"  I don't think I'm a completely unsophisticated filmgoer - fmy favourite film in the last couple of years is ""The Lure"", from Poland - does that help place me? But I loved this movie! I think DuVernay's directorial choices are daring, and I don't like all of them, but I was utterly charmed by most. This is a child's story, told to and for children. If you go, let your inner child watch it. I haven't read the book, but I went with my daughter (BA in Comparative Literature, Masters in Libarary Science) who read it when she was 11 or 12, and she helped keep my expectations for the story itself realistic (youngsters who read it are powerfully affected but often surprised by its flaws if they re-read it later in life). We were both delighted."
"492",1,"  This movie was very slow and boring."
"493",0.5,"  For one of my favorite books as a child, this movie was absolute garbage. The acting was pretty much unwatchable. Pine and Mbatha-Raw were passable, though not stellar, but the three Mrs. were awful from start to finish. I don't know what the director was trying to accomplish, but I pray there are no sequels made. I'll just go back and enjoy the books."
"494",1,"  Well, I read the books......this movie had nothing to do with them....totally changed it. Did not like it at all!"
"495",1,"  My 11-year-old daughter loved it, but even when I tried to watch through the eyes of a child, it just wasn't entertaining. I wanted to like it; I just didn't. I was bored to tears."
"496",2.5,"  I had a hard time following this movie. The first hour is unbelievably slow. the whole movie is clunky and feels like each act was written by someone different. and does mrs. whatsit really turn into a giant lettuce leaf?! I haven't read the book, but I had to do some research and make sure that wasn't in the book. Thank God, it wasn't, which is why my kids enjoyed the book much more than the movie. The acting made this movie watchable, which is why I gave it an extra star than I would have. Chris Pine pulls off some a couple of good emotional scenes that had my wife tearing up. The visuals were also amazing, but good acting and beautiful imagery can't save this mess."
"497",1.5,"  My kid fell asleep during this boring movie, I would recommend waiting for this movie to hit Netflix before watching."
"498",0.5,"  I found this book when I was thirteen (a year after it was published)and loved it and the ones that followed. Disney, as is their talent, did a great job with costumes and special effects while distorting the storyline in significant ways. If I hadn't been with a group, I would have walked out. It's rewritten version has a good message for young girls about claiming their value and developing self-esteem. I just wish they'd made it a new movie with its own storyline created just for it and left WRINKLE IN TIME for some group like a combination of Peter Jackson (finally managed to do Lord of the Rings, also believed something that couldn't translate to film) and the Wachowskis (whose amazing body of work shows, I think, they could capture the essence of the special affects to support the story.)"
"499",0.5,"  A painful cure for insomnia."
"500",1,"  Miserable... DuVernay destroyed L'Engle's classic. Very sad..."
"501",0.5,"  Watching QVC or the HSN selling crappy jewelry would be better than suffering through this film ."
"502",0.5,"  One of the most boring movies you'll ever see. Read the book instead"
"503",1,"  the slow pace of the first hour plus the over directed and nice story line lost my interest."
"504",0.5,"  Everything that was good and hopeful in the movie has been twisted. It's a blatant attempt to remove God as a basis for hope, comfort, and strength. It also just destroyed the original story, opting for glitz and glamour over gritty and real. It's pretty obvious that creativity is dead in Hollywood, which is why this shift to activism. People can't just make a good movie with a good story. There MUST be a message BEYOND that of the intent of the original. If this was an original story/screenplay and NOT based on a classic, it never would have been made by a mainstream studio."
"505",0.5,"  T for..,terrible don't waste your money or time"
"506",1,"  Just a bad boring movie. race has nothing to do with bad rating, a bad movie is just a bad movie"
"507",1,"  Very disappointed and I'm sad for what it could have been. It's very confusing and all of the children we went with left underwhelmed and confused."
"508",1,"  Not worth the price of a ticket, very disappointing took my granddaughter and she wanted to leave early"
"509",1,"  The worst Disney movie I can remember and I'm a 67 year old Disney fan. What happened to the book story line, missing characters?"
"510",2,"  Visually fun, message was a little too preachy."
"511",3,"  Great visuals and a well defined cast of characters but the story and some importantdetails (such as a better defined plot) were left by the side of the road. I had to explain to my parents why certain scenes, though interesting to watch, actuallyPertained to a bigger picture and reveal important but poorly defined details.The moral messages pretty much slapped you in the face throughout the film."
"512",3.5,"  Ok movie, with wonderful actors and visuals, but the score was unmemorable, and the ending felt like the protagonist did nothing to overcome evil."
"513",1,"  self-absorbed garbage. I should have followed my gut and walked out."
"514",1,"  Expected more good believable acting specially with the kids. ?? disappointed."
"515",2.5,"  A movie only good for 5-7 year olds anyone older will be bored out of their mind. Full of MEDIOCRE specal effects and AMATEUR acting, the scenes where either draged out with little to no SIGNIFICANTs or brushed over COMPLETELY. the movie either made no scense or it BASICALLY held your hand and explained everything."
"516",3,"  I didn't hate it even though I'm a good 45 years past the demographic the movie is meant for."
"517",1.5,"  This is a film based on a Christian-inspired book about an epic battle between darkness and light. You won't get that from the movie."
"518",1,"  Nothing redeeming about this movie. The acting is terrible, the characters are terrible, the story is terrible... It's all just terrible."
"519",1,"  Infuriatingly, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" is far worse than I had steeled myself to expect based on various reviews and trailers. Granted, there are good points: excellent casting, good acting (in spite of the actors having little to work with), tactful modernization of the nearly 60 year old story, some clever original scenes, and (surprisingly) one or two well-executed scenes straight from the book. But a terrible screenplay and atrocious editing basically ruin the film (the last scene is a glacially-paced torture of cringe-worthy treacle). They made numerous ill-considered decisions about the narrative that weaken most of the characters in ways that seemed to me completely unnecessary, and - the greatest sin of all, to my mind - they simply do not appear to have trusted the book. And there is too much straight up exposition where one or two hints would suffice. The film's version of the story was flat... it lacked the depth, awe, reverence, humanity, compassion, and ""true-ness"" in the characters' reactions to the supernatural/spiritual forces they encounter that permeated L'Engle's story. The word ""universe"" is thrown about constantly but instead the focus is tight and myopic; not universal at all. I'm so disappointed. I feel like it would have been better if it were not made."
"520",3,"  PROS: Nice wardrobeNice jokesCONS: Emotions was boring, needed work, eg. bollywood movies have this down. Best actor in movie was Reese Witherspoon.While watching the movie I was still waiting for it to start."
"521",1.5,"  lqwef;oihf;oihv;qorih;"
"522",0.5,"  horrible. Horrible. Can we say horrible again. A movie that made little sense - even kids will not like - and had one theme - costume change"
"523",0.5,"  well that's one way to kill a great book, with a bland boring movie. just read the book instead it's a fine piece of art"
"524",1,"  I'm so glad big budget movies that no one wants exist, they make failure fun for everyone. No one should be forced to see this horrid excuse for a movie. Just see Blank Panther again you will thank me later."
"525",4,"  This movie was better than expected! It fell flat in some ways-- like lines not being funny that were clearly supported to be-- but ultimately underneath it was a touching love letter to, not just black girls, but to ALL girls. I loved the spirit and the soul of this movie and loved that my daughter got to see it and it's lessons."
"526",3.5,"  It's a good movie, but it needs more action for adults! For my kids, it was amusing. MORE ACTION!!!"
"527",5,"  A beautiful movie! I wish it had been around when i was a kid, it would have changed my life. I felt like it was made just for me."
"528",2,"  Beautiful, well acted, but what was the point?"
"529",2.5,"  dissapointingly incoherent"
"530",0.5,"  Not worth your time, read the book, its way better."
"531",1,"  A Waste of Time! I should have been visited first by Mrs. Whybother! Thanks for ruining a classic with this disaster, taking a story of enduring worth, and instead manufacturing a mediocre series of plastic special effect gimmicks along with secular sermon drowned in 2018 platitudes of ""morality"". And the ending/resolution gets it completely, utterly wrong - and missed the largest possible point. Wow, what a terribly sad miss."
"532",1,"  I score this movie one star only cause theres no lower rating and cause I like sparkly eyebrows, and there are many sparkly and expensive eyebrows in this movie. The editing and directing is a joke in this movie. Dont even get me started on the script. Even good actors couldnt save this one.. shame.."
"533",0.5,"  I've never been so disappointed in a Disney film. I'm not hard to please when it comes to the movies. All I ask is to be entertained. For all the visuals.... it was not at all entertaining... but instead, left you wanting something the director wasn't ever going to deliver. This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.. it really was that BAD. Poor directing, poor acting, poor writing... The actors only live up to the expectations the directors set for them..... In this instance, I'd put the blame for the box office BOMB onto the film's director. Save your money on this one.. and go see an entertaining film, like the Black Panther that does deliver!"
"534",1,"  Wrinkle In Time is a waste of time to see -- the acting is stiff except for a couple parts, and the mood is soppy, over the top. A few moments work, but save your time! Actually largely the effect is to insult the audience. I almost didn't criticize the unctuous PC virtue signaling to ""diversity"" --- seeing that this has become a highly public controversy. But it's just true, the movie has such pedantic and obvious (add-on, unnecessary and therefore offensively forced) references to Lefty Social Justice Warrior themes and personalities. Obviously beginning with the cast, and the Director's intro. Please! I'm a Diversity Trainer and I just find this crap overdone, counterproductive, self-righteous. Because Hollywood wasn't Lefty enough, right?? Quit ruining entertainment!"
"535",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time is visually stunning, imaginative, and even touching at times with strange but enjoyable performances by its cast, some talented (and even overacting) young stars, and a sense of magic and wonder, even if it can't quite live up to the imagination and charm of its source material!"
"536",1,"  Weird, many themes, scenes, and points from the book missing."
"537",4,"  Great story for all ages. My eldest daughter asked me to take her and didn't have much expectations. I walked out with a great message that we all should be warriors of light fighting the darkness that surround our lives. No one better than Oprah Winfrey acting in the movie can deliver Such a powerful message. I recommend the movie as a family movie with your teenage kids. Enjoy. ?????? ?? ????"
"538",1.5,"  I've often contended that ""boring"" is the worst thing a film can be. Wrinkle in Time makes me rethink that. An exercise in doing, saying & being too much, Wrinkle... certainly isn't boring, but it is bad. It has a lot in common with Tomorrowland: live-action, visually-heavy Disney fantasy-adventures, headed by lauded filmmakers, which celebrate braininess. But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster. It gets credit for being Disney's most enigmatic, eccentric experiments in years, taking visual and philosophical cues from Jodorowsky and Kubrick. Unfortunately, all intended awe and wonder is swallowed up by good, old-fashioned ineptness.The story of a girl having to ""tesser"" across the universe to find her long-lost dad gets some things right, including the critical casting of the lead girl. Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (""I like earthtones.""); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. These obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil ""It"" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels. A forgettable, messy waste of a great cast and iconic source material."
"539",0.5,"  So disappointing how they butchered this classic story. If you loved the book like I did don't waste your time or your money because you will either be extremely disappointed or mad maybe even both."
"540",5,"  Visually stunning. A great story, really enjoyed it!"
"541",1.5,"  This movie felt like the characters were just wandering around aimlessly from bad special effect to bad special effect. Some of the child actors were decent but the youngest child was horrendous. Skip this film."
"542",5,"  I loved this movie. My family saw it together (our daughter is 14) and we all loved it. We laughed, we cried, and in the end, our stand-offish teen held her dad's hand through the credits and out of the theatre. I think this is a must see for any teen girls. Its message of positivity and self-worth is one girls need to hear right now. I loved it, and I'd see it again!"
"543",4,"  While definitely not for everyone, A Wrinkle in Time is a faithful, if messy, adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's controversial novel. Aided by vivid visuals, and a host of intriguing characters, Ava Duvernay's film is a unique family film and much darker than most family live action films by Disney. The storytelling is largely visual as the exposition heavy novel gets heavily streamlined in the opening scenes, creating confusion for those who are not familiar at all with the book. Still, the film adaptation won't work on everyone, as its optimistic and thoroughly cheesy hearted spectacle might annoy viewers looking for sophisticated fantasy. As a lover of the book, the film fulfills most of what I was hoping for and it is a dazzling film for brave kids. Rating: 77"
"544",0.5,"  We saw this movie last week because the one we went to see wasn't playing as we thought. This was honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, maybe the worst. There aren't enough words in the whole English language to describe how horrible this movie is. I don't know what's worse, the bovine acting, the mind numbingly boring script, or the clumsy, bungling directing. I would give this movie negative 5 stars for wasting two hours of my life if I could."
"545",2,"  I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO HAPPENS TO BE A FILMMAKER. I DON'T MEAN TO WRITE IN ALL CAPS, SO PLEASE PARDON. I AM ANNOYED THAT THIS INDUSTRIES' CULTURE OF CRITICS AND PR FOLKS WOULD DARE TRY TO BLAME THIS MOVIE'S POOR RATING ON POLITICS. THE FILM WAS DECENT, NOT GREAT. SURE, THE SOURCE MATERIAL WAS DIFFICULT, BUT SO ARE MANY OTHERS. THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RACE OR GENDER OF THE DIRECTOR OR THE CAST. IT'S ABOUT CRAFT. THE BEAUTY IS AVA HAD (AND HAS) THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A BIG BUDGET MEDIOCRE FILM, LIKE EVERY OTHER WHITE MALE FILMMAKER, WHO GETS MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO FAIL UNTIL THEY GET GOOD. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE. SHE STRUCK OUT, OKAY, FINE. SHE'LL GET MORE CHANCES TO MAKE A HOME RUN. AND IT'S THAT LAST PART -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO FAIL UPWARDS -- THAT SHOULD BE THE REAL THING TO POLITIC ABOUT. NEXT."
"546",0.5,"  horrid from beginning to end who cast this? AnotherPC run amok wreck from Disney and company. The director needs some film school"
"547",4,"  I saw this movie on the Saturdat it came out and I was not disappointed! I read the book in the 6th grade and loved it! This is coming from someone who hates reading. I had low expectations for the movie, but the movie did the book justice. In my personal opinion (as well as my grandmother's) it was better than the book. It is an amazing story of a daughter and her adopted brother on an adventure with the girl's new friend to save her dad. This is an amazing family movie and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. I didn't expect something so well done from Disney."
"548",0.5,"  I haven't read the book but I can see how it might be good. However I've never wanted to walk out of a movie so bad. (I stayed because my husband wanted to laugh through it). At first I thought it may be good for small children (some of the characters were too cheesy to take seriously) but there are parts that may be too frightening for children. There is too much focus on weird psychedelic experiences and not enough character development. The touching parts weren't touching because it was all a joke. Surprised they got so many famous actors/actresses to participate."
"549",4,"  I loved the movie honestly. The messages of empowerment, self esteem, love and light were incredibly personal and hit me in a pretty spectacular way. This movie is a win for representation and female empowerment."
"550",5,"  A beautiful inspiring movie about a little girl who is learning to love herself and saves her father and the universe with math! The design, costumes, performances (those kids were wonderful) were an immersive magical experience. A kids movie for sure, but so much to be enjoyed by grownups too!"
"551",1,"  What a way to ruin a great book! No redeeming qualities. Big budget, big stars, big special effects complete fail."
"552",1,"  I wanted to like this film. I really did. I loved the book as a kid and greatly enjoy most sci-fi/fantasy films even the critically reviewed ""bad"" ones. So, I went with an open mind. Unfortunately, by almost any metric, the film is awful. The casting was unbelievable, the celebrities playing over the top dress up was distracting, and the dialog *somehow* made even less sense than in the book. I was really disappointed. Someone told me that by watching the film, I should appreciate that I was making a political statement. My intent was to be entertained, not engage in the civil discourse. Epic fail on my part."
"553",0.5,"  If you read the book don't go see this movie. If you haven't read the book stay at home and read it instead of seeing this movie."
"554",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time is a mediocre movie at best. The story of one girl's journey to find her father (and her self) is very powerful. The special effects are stunning and groundbreaking. Where the film falls short is on two levels. First, it takes too many liberties with the source material. With its religious undertones in the book, the film disregards all of those elements that helped drive the story and characters to the climatic end. Second, it is a film with hesitation. It tries to be somewhat true to the original source material while trying to update it for the modern audience. It leads to some moments being awkward and unpolished. If you want to see a well polished film, that is faithful to it's source material, then I would not watch this film"
"555",5,"  My takeaways from Ava DuVernay's, A Wrinkle In Time:1. You are enough. Perfectly created in every way.2. Be fearless. Don't let the negativity of the world dim your light.3. Be a light to the world in the midst of darkness. We can all make a difference.-Thank you for the reminder, Ava!"
"556",0.5,"  Mosh boring movie EVER! Fell asleep & my kids did too!"
"557",1,"  BORING worst disney movie ever."
"558",0.5,"  worst movie...not even a bit of interesting anything in the movie"
"559",2,"  Sstarted out good, but got frustrating in the middle. By the end my daughter and I were both disinterested. Disappointing."
"560",0.5,"  They stripped Christianity from this movie, then they attempted to sell it back to us on the whim of progressive ideals. Fail, fail, fail."
"561",3,"  Much better then the previews led you to believe. Loved the book and the movie did OK - followed it more then Peter Jackson did for the Hobbit :) 13 out of 20 stars"
"562",1,"  What could have been a great movie, turned out to be missing the main part of the original story, Christianity! The movie lacks what made the original story magical. This film was a total let down! Our entire group was let down!"
"563",2,"  Disappearing jackets, skipping parts of the book. Left people confused after the ending, anticlimatic. I read the book in middle school, hating it, but I came to this movie with hopes because it had an amazing cast and director but ultimately it failed, it didn't capture the total idea of the book, it glossed over important facts...and again, DISAPPEARING JACKETS."
"564",2,"  This is not a very good movie because of sjw politics and bad acting. It had good SFX, but I expected better of an oprah movie."
"565",1,"  This movie hurt my eyes and stole some IQ points from me, ouch and ugh."
"566",4.5,"  This movie was absolutely stunning to look at. The supportive women was one of the most empowering aspect of this movie to me which made the movie so much more fun to watch. Not to to mention their beautiful graphics, costume design, and sets met a wide range of depth to the movie. The movie is not simple, but its main theme is that in order to defeat darkness in this world, one must know who they are to fight back with strength, not with ego or revenge."
"567",4,"  great for kids and inspiring. Has some meh moments, but got me a few times"
"568",2.5,"  I wanted to love this. But this is a Christian story and the stripping of all vestiges of its Christian foundation rendered the story confusing and pointless. In addition, the constant inappropriate longing glances and near kisses from 11/12 year olds was unnecessary. But worst of all, Reese Witherspoon as ""Mrs Whatsit"" was a bully and not the inspiration I wanted her to be to young Meg. Having an adult bully and already bullied child was a weird choice."
"569",2,"  Visually stunning, but only tangentially connected to the classic book. A real disappointment from a storytelling perspective."
"570",1.5,"  I was leery of seeing this after the trailers, but hoped the glittery wardrobes would not take away from the original story. But instead of an epic drama done with the finesse of LOTR and Harry Potter, I had to slog through a fluffy ""power of girl"" coming of age take. The movie was pleasant enough, but was a bubble gum version of a novel that has gripped readers for decades with the stories that each of the characters carries. I can't see book sales taking off thanks to the movie. My kids were in hysterics at the phoniness of the movie."
"571",1,"  UNLESS YOU HAVE A DISCOMBOBULATED HEAD FETISH DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"
"572",2,"  Well intentioned, with a strong performance by its lead, and probably deserving a a fully animated treatment, the immersion is ripped away by terribly integrated CGI and awkwardly jilted lines."
"573",1.5,"  WE loved the book. They author beautifully illustrated God's Love and how God chooses to use the smallest of people to fight the darkness. Disney took out every reference to God. They made a movie about the power of loving yourself. That's a fine message, but there are plenty of movies available with that theme. This book was so much bigger than that. So I think if you loved the book, it's possible you won't be a fan of the movie. If you've never read the book, the movie will be very confusing. Save your money."
"574",0.5,"  Horribly disappointing. Barely follows the classic book. Boring. This is a film to promote Oprah as god like and they don't even try to disguise it-they literally made her larger than life. Boo to Disney on this one."
"575",1,"  Save your money. Not worth watching. I thought Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon were pretty good, but not enough to carry the rest of the cast. I felt like it was a place for Oprah to get on a soap box and preach. Felt more like an hour and half worth of talk show rhetoric. Truly not much plot line.....this could have been a fantastic movie. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
"576",2.5,"  while there are things i do like about this movie,i mostly found my self cringing in the theater. the effects are fine, the acting is passable although rarely in the film do they show normal human emotion to jaw dripping things like a godzilla sized oprah. but by far the worst thing about this film is Charles Goddamn Wallace!"
"577",3,"  A Wrinkle IN Time is too fast paced fro the audience to understand the true message of the story. the special effect are amazing and if you look past the bland plot then you will see the beauty of the story. The other problem is that if you haven't read the book then you probably won't understand the film, and if you have read the book then you will see how far it steers from the original story."
"578",4,"  It may be a little hokey and overwrought at times, but it's full of genuine wonder, emotion, and optimism. I mean, it's a fantasy movie! Though it may not be a perfect movie, or adaptation, it's true to the spirit of the source material and a great movie for a child (or childlike spirit) to see."
"579",0.5,"  Complete waste of time, no point, plotless, dull, and irrelevant."
"580",3,"  A Wrinkle in Time was my favorite book as a child, and I do not recommend this movie to anyone else who loved the book. Visually stunning and full of childhood magic, it loses any grit and reality the book had with completely flat characters. I love that every child could see themselves in this movie, but after being so excited from the day I heard this movie was being made, I was deeply, deeply disappointed. Disney, step up your game.."
"581",4,"  A few script problems, few dumb moments, but not nearly enough to make this film awful. The acting across the board is really good with Storm Reid being perfect as Meg. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I can see why some might not enjoy it."
"582",3.5,"  It's a great message: believe in yourself and love can change the world. The light can drive out the dark. It's a message I believe in. But this felt like such an extravagant vehicle to get this message across. By being so over the top, it kind of lost the heart of the story. I love Oprah, but I was not a fan of giant Oprah, much better to be the same size of the other Ms. The costumes were eye-popping, could be an Oscar nomination for those! The kids were great, all the actors were great, but it tried to be too dazzling and lost some connection. Still worth seeing, imho, if you're a fan of the book but not necessarily a purist as there are some changes."
"583",5,"  Great movie and great story or finding your puropose"
"584",0.5,"  Worst movie I have seen. The only movie I was ready to walk out of. A complete waste of time that I will never get back. ????"
"585",0.5,"  This movie was the biggest wast of time. It should not be PG it would be PG12. Do not wast your time."
"586",1,"  Ooo, yeah. You know that feeling you had when you left the theater after seeing Black Panther? Yea, Uh, no. You'll leave the theater feeling the polar opposite, and you'll wish you could get your wrinkle in time back (and your money). This was just awful on so many levels. It was a poor script, poor acting and crazy editing. The direction was ""interesting"" at best. And the acting? Just no. Save your coins, or go see Black Panther again. Trust me. ;)"
"587",2,"  The selling point of this film is Oprah. The plot was boring and underdeveloped. The graphics, however, were phenomenal."
"588",4,"  love is all we need??"
"589",5,"  Wow, this is a great film!"
"590",5,"  This has always been one of my favorite books and I loved the movie as well, despite a little heavy-handedness on the messages. It's great to see a movie with strong women, a starring role for a young girl, science-based principles (einstein's theory of relativity), as well as both adventure and emotion. I'd go again in a heartbeat!"
"591",2,"  I had high hopes and was very disappointed with this version. The fx and visuals are great, but the story was gutted. If you like the book at all, the 2004 version (also by disney) is much, much better, despite fewer bells and whistles. I suppose for someone who hasn't read the book, it would be ok. Otherwise, don't waste your money, go hunt up the older one."
"592",0.5,"  Stay home and watch the grass grow."
"593",1,"  Visually this movie spares no expense but the story feels quite hallow while at the same time preachy. lack of direction provides a less than satisfying conclusion."
"594",1,"  Awful, awful, awful....I read the book first and it was really good. the movie was beyond cheesy. I almost walked out half way through. save your money and time."
"595",1,"  ""A Wrinkle in Time"" has a handful of scenes of that prompt intrigue and wonder. These are executed extremely well and done with great care.Unfortunately, the overall narrative is muddied by an overly busy plot that lacks any sense of continuity and direction. So, we arrive at the end not fully knowing how we got there. That, and some of the performances here are not good.It was ambitious and well-intended. But good intentions don't always result in actual good."
"596",1,"  This movie was a Big Disappointment, as a child I loved the book."
"597",4,"  Why in hell is A Wrinkle in Time getting so many bad reviews? America is really sick. I was really touched by this movie especially because I know how it feels to want to save your father from peril. My father was an alcoholic and throughout my childhood I wanted to heal and save my father from his demons. Well the young heroine of the film did it - she rescued her father! The audience was clapping when the film ended. I wanted to cry. A Wrinkle in Time is a wonderful family movie. Please go see this movie with your children."
"598",5,"  Loved it! I read the book as a child and it was my favorite. Saw the first Disney movie and it was great. I just Love this story."
"599",2,"  Wait until it comes out on Netflix! on the one hand, the acting seemed to salvage a hastily written screenplay, but on the other hand, the superficial roles by each character and a plot that wasn't easy to follow unless you read the book spoil what could have been a better screen adaptation. i see potential in the young actors, but there are a lot of things that only experience can teach them that they will need to acquire in order to have acting careers!"
"600",5,"  I know a lot of people didnt like this, but i honestly cant figure out why. I know the story is kinda kitchy, and goes a bit all over the place, but i feel like that was intentional. Life is a bit all over the place. Ava duverney was able to fit into a beatly wrapped barra something that isn't totally neatly wrapped at all times. I Enjoyed the story itself and feel like i got what i was promised; a disney movIe with a ""feel good"" ending. I also loved the References throughout to strock Black HISTORICAL FIGURES! Side note: 50+ foot tall oprah = <3"
"601",5,"  I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It is not a perfect match to the book, and I didn't expect it to be. The director made each change deliberately and the love and thoughfulness put into this movie shows at every turn. The visuals and art direction were stunning and unique, something I always appreciate when I go to see a movie. But bottom line, my kids loved this movie and got to see a preteen girl be the hero using her wits and her faults to save the day even when the adults failed. fantastic."
"602",4,"  Overall, an admiraBle attemPt at a book that is ""unflimable!"" Storm reid did a fantastic job, as did the rest of the Child actors on the movie, definitely had room for improvemEnt to make it less preachy and to develop more of some of the characters (aka calVin). But I'd see it agaiN and as a children's story i believe it is a great movie."
"603",0.5,"  Terrible movie that doesn't represent the book in the least."
"604",5,"  I watched a Wrinkle in time with my 3 year old niece who has never sat through a movie. She sat through this whole movie! It was quite the adventure with so many seeds I hope are planted in the hearts of children who see it. I've never read the book, so I don't know how true it is to it's literature but it is an amazing magical movie. What an escape from all of the world's negativity, this work of light by ava duvernay."
"605",1,"  They tessered until it wrinkled the story.I gave one star because the costumes were well done. The movie is just meh. I watched this after I finished reading the book. From the beginning, I knew I wasn't going to be able to compare the book and the movie. After watching the first 15 minutes, I got confused with how the director told the story. My husband who didn't read the book fell asleep cuz it was too confusing and boring. While I really wanted to support the girl power in this movie, I don't think the director knew how to translate the story to the big screen. Not to mention - the acting of Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin were so plain and weren't convincing enough to tesser us to a different universe. Sorry kids, try again next time."
"606",2.5,"  It's a rare site in children's movies to see truly stunning visuals, however this film breaks out of that standard. Entire worlds collapse and restructure within seconds, and incredible embodiments of pure evil are visualized faultlessly. While traveling the stars, meg, charles and the celestial guides go through a process called ""tessering"", which is accompanied by jaw-dropping colors, warps and waves. The hyperrealistic depictions of deep-space planets inspire awe at the wonder of life itself, and never for a second cast doubt on the reality of these other worlds.However, the visuals is where it stops. The plot failed to captivate my mind, and the characters were hardly interesting. Disney might want to reallocate a little more of their visuals budget for some better writing next time."
"607",4,"  It is a beautiful picture with a good pace, not too fast. Storm Reid gave an excellent performance. Ava DeVernay did a great job. I will see this again."
"608",1,"  The commercials praise A Wrinkle In Time as ""empowering"" and ""inspiring"". Either would matter if it was also entertaining. It's got a new song by Sade at least. That ain't nothing."
"609",1,"  Looked forward to this since it was announced and was very disappointed!"
"610",0.5,"  boring and complete mess of a story."
"611",5,"  A Wrinkle IN Time was my favourite Book as a child. I also reread it 4 times in the last 6 years to my 3 daughters. I took 10 kids to see the move and as you can imagine I had a lot invested in this being awesome. Guess what? I really enjoyed the film and the vision. I have read a bunch of the personal reviews and it's ironic that most of the things people dont like are specific to the story in the book. This is a very very hard story to adapt to the screen, there is so much internal struggle and sweetness, despair, Darkness, Light and spirituality in the book. I love the attempt, the vision and the result. WAS it perfect, no. Was it wonderful, yes."
"612",3.5,"  While visually stunning, it misses the mark, mostly because of too many changes to the original (and very beloved) story by Madeliene l'engle. In particular, aunt beast was written out. While not appearing until near the end of the book, aunt beast helped meg understand there are no easy answers and deal with the misplaced anger she has towards her father. Most perplexing is the inclusion of a new character, a bully named Veronica who seems to have no purpose in the plot."
"613",5,"  great movie.Instant classic."
"614",3.5,"  everOne just needs to take a chill pill about This mOvie. THe critics REVIEWs are harsh and undeserving. I re-read the book foR the first time in 36 years RECENTLY And found it to be as fun and IMAGINATIVE as is this film adaptation is. I think they might have been better off splitting The movie into two parts to stay a little closerTo the orGinal storyline but other than that. It is FreSh, beautiully shot and very entertaining. It is a little scary for Those 6 and under but other than that it is good family fun."
"615",5,"  A WRINKLE IN TIME IS VISUALLY STUNNING, HEARTFELT, AND INSPIRING. I WAS CAPTIVATED WITH THE PLOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THE CAST DID AN AMAZING JOB. STORM REID WAS EXCEPTIONAL AS THE LEAD."
"616",5,"  I thought it was interesting."
"617",4.5,"  a wrinkle in time is visually stunning, heartfelt, and inspiring. I was captivated with the plot all the way through. The cast did an amazing job. Storm reid was exceptional as the lead."
"618",1.5,"  How do you decide to try and secularize a story that's literally about spirituality itself?"
"619",5,"  All of the stars. Glorious Girl poweR. I loved this book as a kid and this did not Disappoint. Representation matters!"
"620",1,"  Simply awful. I wish I could find a wrinkle in Time to get those two hours of my life back. I suppose I should say slightly less than two hours. So much of the movie was just randomness that appeared to be trying to fill time to make it long enough to be considered a movie."
"621",2.5,"  Superb Colour Palate. Lovely cinematography, costume and set design, and bits of heartfelt acting, but full of plotholes and nebulous dialogue that could have been avoided by following the outlines of L'Engle's book more closely. Definitely a fun, if a bit confusing, watch."
"622",5,"  I loved the movie. It was beautiful and moving. The cast was EXCELLENT. It is not a perfect version of the book. But it is a gooD family movie with lots of adventure and heart. I Saw it with friends. I Plan to see it agAin with my kids."
"623",5,"  No surprise all the white male reviewers don't get this movie. It is a feminine film and a visual poem about the power of love. It is a children's movie made for children and every woman who never got to see herself represented as the hero in a children's story."
"624",2,"  Was expectiNg alot more due to the great cast but somehow the movie was not well put together, my daughters read the book and said it was nothing compared to it."
"625",2,"  Diversity for the sake of diversity gives us A Wrinkle in Time: a mediocre movie at best. When the only asset is the diverse cast, Sorry not sorry, it does not make it good. The dialogue feels forced and the plot is bland. Black Panther did not have these types of problem."
"626",5,"  Visually amazing! casting and acting was great. great job, ava!"
"627",2,"  This was a prettier version of Stranger things. We were bored and confused, I even fell asleep at one point, woke up, and didn't seem to miss much."
"628",0.5,"  This was literally the worst movie. Dont Even think about spending money on it because youll fall asleep becaUse its so bad. If i could gIve this negative stars i would."
"629",5,"  loved! Makes me want to reread it. Forgotten how imaginative it was. My daughters loved it."
"630",0.5,"  I have never gone to sleep watching a movie before. They can sell this BORING crap as a over the counter sleep aid. It worked for me."
"631",5,"  A really terrific and engaging movie. We all loved it."
"632",0.5,"  You will love this movie if you enjoy flying lettuce, terrible acting, giant oprah in a mermaid costume, and a director who can't seem to connect 2 scenes together."
"633",3.5,"  Movie is fun, But sometimes is TOO ambitious and overconfident of itself."
"634",3,"  Visually stunning. I believe too much time was spent on visuals and not enough on story. Almost right, but not quite."
"635",4.5,"  Going to see this movie you must watch it through the wonder of a child. When you do that, while it is a little slow to build for adults and leaves you with a few lingering questions when the story ends, it is wonderful. To see so many powerful and strong women, as well as a diverse cast on screen, you can't helped but be moved."
"636",0.5,"  VAPITY thy name is A WRINKLE IN TIME. THIS MOVIE IS THE HOLLOW UNIVERSE."
"637",2,"  Just meh. It did not do the book Justice. The director was overly concerned about using cgi hand let the story telling flop. The dialog felt disjointed and bad editing reinforced the discomfort. They found was to pull at heart strings, but it was obvious and short lived."
"638",3.5,"  Overall, I enjoyed this film. In it's effort to simplify the narrative of the book - I think it chose to spend its time on the wrong areas. for the MRs. characters - they could've have been a bit more light hearted (at least at times). I loved the casting especially for the kids and the happy medium. Good fun for target age - though i hoped it was going to be stronger."
"639",0.5,"  There was a cgi overload. Some imporant Parts were miSsing from the moive. ALsO some Of the stOry line did not connect at all. The three mrS. Were all Amazing."
"640",1,"  Disney removed the central theme of the book, Christianity, thus creating a shallow, uninteresting movie."
"641",3.5,"  I really enjoyed watching this movie. it was fun and whimsical and easily brought in my interest."
"642",2.5,"  Instead of the director giving a ""thank you"" message before the preview, she should instead offer an apology."
"643",2,"  i was really into this movie until the instant that oprah winfrey showed up on the screen. She broke the ""magic"" of the film because she has such a gigantic cultural imprint already. it was impossible to not think 'that's oprah there on the screen""."
"644",5,"  This movie brings together the world of adults and children. the beauty of science and magic is shown. If you don't see it with an open heart and mind you won't Enjoy it. This movie reminds us of the beauty of love anD life. It teaches us to love ourselves and to value what we have (including our faults)"
"645",3,"  Most of the messaging from the book is still there but the pacing of the movement seems clunky. They took out the whole explanation of the ant walking on a string bit (which is the foundation of the title) which is mind boggling to me. Most of the acting was good except for the teachers and calvin....who just randomly appears of out no where and who was extremely bad at acting."
"646",5,"  My two daughters and I went to see this film. one of them is 10 and one is eleven. They both loved it so much and both almost cryed. This film is amazing because a lot of people can relate to meg and seeing a black female on screen is very important."
"647",5,"  This is a Wonderful movie to share with children as it touches on issues of loss and disappointment that are difficult to reach in any meaningful way with simple talk. Perhaps other movie-goers were disappointed that this is not the standard marvel comic special effects action movie. it is definitely more gentle and offers a model of how to treat others with kindness.. it helps that the cast is wonderfully diverse and the eleven year old is a realistic heroine. The visuals do not disappoint, either. and the actors turn in powerful performances.. i think the low ratings simply reflect the fact movie goers have become accustomed to patterns of mediocrity. that refuse to delve into and explore real human emotions."
"648",0.5,"  JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PC CORRECTED GARBAGE.you'd THINK THEY GOT THE HINT THAT PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY SICK OF HOLLYWOOD CREATING THE WORLD IN THEIR OWN IMAGE."
"649",1,"  ALL CAP due to website, reload or pressing Caps did not help, sorry.Saw it the first night it was out. Had high hopes, due to the trailer and it was just disappointing.No magic or spark in the movie. was it the script? I thought the acting was decent. but it just did not resonate with me, at all.At least Black Panther made a $1B globally, which will help Disney soften the blow from this disaster movie. Hurricane Heist is probably better, or for a sure bet try watching Thoroughbred."
"650",4.5,"  Wonderful movie. Heroine is a young teen woman who makes a physical journey through space and time with her younger brother and a friend to save her dad, and makes a journey within, discovering her own beauty, strength and power. I'm a fan of the book, and like all movies from books, it is different from the book. The movie captures the spirit and heart of the book. This is a children's movie.. There are some scary Stepford wives type scenes and a creepy beach scene - and the It is a scary brain that influences thoughts and emotions. There are no intergalactic spaceship fights, the fight is for hearts and minds. I would compare it favorably to the Wizard of Oz, and both versions of the Wiz - even though it is not a musical. Has something in common with the first Spy Kids movie that really had the children as the heroes - that one featured a Latino family. Enjoyed seeing it in a theater filled with children and their parents - the children loved it! At the end, everyone clapped! Do something good for your spirit and go see this film!"
"651",1,"  don't know why they removed the christian principles"
"652",4,"  A beautiful film with strong female characters. exactly what i was look for in 2018."
"653",4,"  This movie is hartwarming and vert good, but it seemed to be misdibg somyhing, also they couldve GIveN it some tweeeks to be more lije the book. In the short Jist i sTill loved the movie."
"654",0.5,"  The dark, difficult theme of the original story is buried under appalling costuming, mediocre acting, and happy emphasis on politically correct messaging. who can't deliver great cgi today? great cgi does not add bonus points to a badly scripted story. read the book."
"655",4,"  I found ""A Wrinkle in Time"" to be a beautiful-looking, serious, sweet, and entertaining movie for teens, young adults, and adults -- praise to Ava DuVernay for her wonderful directing!"
"656",1,"  This movie was HORRIBLE. This is the first time I ever felt I wanted my money back. Disney has devolved into a political propaganda machine that sees its role as overturning everything about traditional America."
"657",3.5,"  This is an endearing film with so much heart. I really don't understand all the hate for it."
"658",2.5,"  Costumes and makeup were impressive. Zach G. had me tearing up a bit. the director's over-reliance on close ups was a continual distraction."
"659",1.5,"  HalF the movie was walking or running to a place, so the characters could stand around talking while green screen special effects go on around them - the other half is the characters saying ""Charles Wallace!"""
"660",3,"  It's not as awe inspiring as it wants to be, but at least these kids can act."
"661",2.5,"  I LOVED THE CHILD ACTORS BUT THE ADULTS ACTORS, NOT SO MUCH. THE MOVIE FELL FLAT FOR ME BUT IT IS VISUALLY STUNNING. IT IS NOT THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN BY A LONG SHOT BUT IT JUST DOES NOT QUITE COME TOGETHER."
"662",0.5,"  Never thought I would see a movie, with dialogue so on the nose, that it would make ""The Meteor Man"" look subtle, but ""A Wrinkle in Time"" proved me wrong."
"663",2,"  ToOk the family to see, hoping for a good disney movie. The movie dragged on and at one point my daughter was almost sleeping. i never read the book but this story was boring and lacked substance."
"664",0.5,"  TERRIBLE FILM! THE SCENES ARE COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED. THERE IS NO DETAIL OR BACK STORY GIVEN. I, LIKE MOST VIEWERS, HAVE NEVER READ THE BOOK, BUT I'M SURE IT IS BETTER THAN THIS FILM. THE ONLY THINGS OF THIS FILM TO DRAW YOU IN, IS WHAT YOU WILL SEE IN THE TRAILERS, AN AMAZING CAST LINEUP AND BEAUTIFUL VIDEOGRAPHY....BUT THAT IS ALL. THE STORY HAS THE POTENTIAL OF HAVING SOME MOVING MOMENTS AND POSITIVE THEMES, BUT SKIPS ON THE CONNECTION POINTS AND LEFT THIS VIEWER COMPLETELY DISCOMBOBULATED."
"665",4,"  A sweet sci-fi adventure for the entire family, a wrinkle in time contains moments of extreme beauty and pathos. not for those who want an intense pace and violence."
"666",1,"  ANOTHER BAD MOVIE FROM DISNEY..... When will it stop? they wouldn't make a sequel to tron legacy, but they crank bad stories out like this one? i have also heard rumors that this director was going to be tapped to do star wars (which is a total mess now) or a marvel movie. I HOPE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TRUTH TO THOSE RUMORS. IT WOULD NOT END WELL."
"667",1.5,"  Poor adaptation of the Book. Lackluster."
"668",5,"  This movie was super! It had great characters, a good story, and really pretty visuals. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope they make movies based on the rest of the books in the Time Quintet series."
"669",3.5,"  i likED tHIS MOVIE, AND ALMOST PERFECT ADAPTATION OF THE BOOK BEING THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A PERSONAL SPIRITUAL JOURNEY. mORE TWIlIGHT ZONE THAN NORMAL DISNEY STUFF. MISSING THOUGH WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE ACTUAL WRINKLE AS SHOWN IN THE PREVIEWS, VERY WEIRD. THE KIDS WERE INCREDIBLE. THIS IS MORE OF AN OLDER CHILD AND YOUNG PARENT MOVIE. I DO RECOMMEND READING THE BOOK TOO, IT EXPLAINS A WEE BIT MORE. THERE IS A GOOD COMIC-NOVEL TO READ FOR THIS."
"670",0.5,"  A Meandering mess. Not anything like the book, the book was wonderful, but the writer and director had to take a great story and make it into something unwatchable. not worth seeing."
"671",3.5,"  Just saw A Wrinkle In Time  and it was a good adaptation. The twins were left out, as was kything, but those are minor things. I really liked it. I think the faMily to a multicultural one was a good move. Chris pine was good as the dad. My one compl is that the kid who played Charles wallace was a bit too cHeEry. I always saw him as more on the autistic Spec"
"672",1.5,"  visually appealing but messy story line."
"673",0.5,"  This movie makes me want to kill myself"
"674",2,"  I was so disappointed by this film. A cast this solid in its acting strength (at least among the adult cast), a director this talented, a production so visionary in its use of color and style, and a source material as innovative as madeleine L'engle's seminal novel should have all come together to create a stellar film. somehow, as mysteriously as the mechanics of tesseracts, almost all the magic disappeared in the conversion from print to film. There are a few moments here and there that serve as inklings of the movie that this tried to be: Mrs. Which comforting Meg upon their arrival on Orion, Mrs. Whatsit's adorably verbose absent-mindedness, and the undeniable chemistry between the actors playing Meg's parents all leapt off the screen. But amid those brighter flashes was poor child acting, a distracting barrage of extreme close-ups for no discernible reason, obvious inflation of the run time through transparent plot devices (Calvin falling off Mrs. Whatsit as she was flying, some forest-tornado thing erupting on Camazotz, etc.), rushed lines that should be interesting but don't land due to the way they are filmed, and a host of other nuts and bolts issues that unforgivably weakened this film. Honestly, because all the pieces are so clearly there, I wish that Ava DuVernay would agree to a series of reshoots in order to give audiences the film that they truly deserve."
"675",1,"  We took my 10 year old daughter. It held her attention., but the movie went nowhere for all its hype and inter stellar potential. Vivid colors but overall it was a flop. Sorry oprah"
"676",1,"  One of thenworstI just felt like they did not take the time to explain much of anything before throwing the viewer into this weird universe. They skipped over so much (I'm sure it made a lot more sense to people who read the book) and didn't take much time for character development so, as a first time viewer, I didn't much care about the characters which meant I lost interest in the storyline. I felt the film was underdevelopand rushed the story and, if I'm being honest, the acting was the worst part. I felt like this was everyone's first time acting....it felt more like broadway dramatized ""over"" acting than actual movie acting (very different techniques) which made it sort of corny to me....forced jokes."
"677",5,"  light and Dark. Soul and Depression. understanding what the Light is, how to build and sustain it is a personal journey for all with many paths. Depression can creep in and block out and stomp out the light. wrinkle in time is a tool for your toolbox in your journey to have belief in the light/soul. a movie that i had to see but did not know it from the trailers or other reviews"
"678",0.5,"  This movie was painful.. the editing was bad, you feel nothing for any of these characters, the writing was bad, it was predicable ."
"679",5,"  I really liked the movie. It was really worth seeing I thought."
"680",1,"  I crap in all aspects. Not sure if it is due the base book or due to the script adaptation"
"681",2.5,"  Oprah + glitter + body positiveCute mix of all trends."
"682",4,"  A Wrinkle in Time is the family movie you have been waiting for. It is an emotionally stirring journey through the human condition that will energize and captivate you. The movie is a must see for teens and tweens.I went into A Wrinkle in Time with no knowledge of the storyline. I have never read the book and I thought the movie looked a little gaudy and strange in the trailer. However, from the first few minutes of the movie, I was hooked. The movie is about family, sacrifice, understanding your worth, and choosing to be a warrior for good.A Wrinkle in Time is an absolutely beautiful film, both in content and cinematography. There is much to see and learn. The media screening I attended included a short clip from Ava DuVerney, the movie's director. She shared that she wanted to create a movie about joy and she invited the audience to watch it through the eyes of your 11 or 12 year old self. I took her advice and prepared myself for something I hoped would be special. I cried tears of joy and love in this movie more than once and I do not often cry at movies.A Wrinkle in Time gracefully deals with so many issues: bullying, adoption, loss, self-hate, evil, selfishness, abuse, and forgiveness. I am sure that some will see political themes in the film, but I felt A Wrinkle in Time transcended that and reminded us all that we need to embrace the light in humanity and try to understand one another. A Wrinkle in Time is a beautifully diverse movie with a big heart.A Wrinkle in Time is a Wizard of Oz or Neverending Story for this generation of teens and older tweens. If they only watch one movie this year, I hope it is this one. However, it might be a little scary for younger children as there are some perilous scenes and a violent attempt on a main character's life. You know your kid best"
"683",0.5,"  It's like one of those movies that make you think about it for a while but I'm just thinking about if I have ever watched a worse movie than this. I'd give one star for visual fx and that's it. Shit acting across the board, shit direction, shit screenwriting and cinematography. They could have produced a one hour Lincoln commercial with Matthew McConaughey rolling a booger between his fingers and it'd be better than this."
"684",0.5,"  PAINFULLY unwatchable pure drivel, SHAMEFUL WASTE of money and talent, can only imagine how many WORTHWHILE projects sit around waiting to be funded."
"685",3,"  Visually stunning and with a wonderful cast. The message had meaning but it kind of lost translation onto the big screen!"
"686",0.5,"  A waste Of time. The actors were not INVOLVED. Pena did the best acting, pine looked lost, surprisingly galifinakus appeared to Be attempting to esCape, and opRah for president 2020? The musical score drowned out the NARRATIVES. The movie had a thEme of leadership, but the film Was completely mismanaged. I felt like pIne was APOLOGIZING for the eNtire movIe. Plastic and lifelEss. This could have been a theatrical MASTERPIECE with an enchanting MUSICAL scoRe and instead it landed in the Land of wtf?! DuvernAy seEmingly felt that the book was too sensible for her...style."
"687",2,"  BEAUTIFUL VISUALS, AMAZING PREFORMANCES, A GREAT SOUNDTRACK, AND AN INTERESTING PLOT ARE RUINED BY WONKY PACING, QUESTIONABLE DIALOGUE, AND VERY SLOPPY WRITING THAT FEELS LIKE THE FIRST DRAFT."
"688",1.5,"  the story could have been told in 20 minutes, what little story there is."
"689",1,"  Im upset i cant put negitive 10 stars. Change the name to ""Do not waste your time"" I nolonger like reEce wHiterspoon."
"690",0.5,"  i READ "" A wrinkle in time"" when I was a kid and loved it. It was a great book, but this movie takes out the main theme of the story and changes the book way to much. It is a shame that hollywood and disney are so arrogant as to think they could improve on this book, when it was already a great classic. when will the idiots with small brains learn they cannot."
"691",5,"  When I was watching this movie, I felt like I was sharing a memory. It was brilliantly done and was visually fantastic. It completely blew me away. I'm not EXAGgerating when I say that this movie has changed my life. A Wrinkle In Time has INSPIRED me to take on things I never thought were possible. Thank the universe got this fantastic experience."
"692",1,"  WOw this is bad. Save your money watch blackpanther or donate To charity."
"693",1,"  For first time in ages I wanted to leave the movie theater in the middle of the movie"
"694",2.5,"  Everything good in this movie (and there is some) is from the book. Everything bad is the new material for the movie. They made an iconic scifi fantasy trite with lengthy speeches that just didn't work. The scary bits from the book that resembled The Prisoner or Twilight Zone episodes were cut down to make room for more self-help speeches and more material about the bad science and poor world building. The humor referenced modern stuff and didn't land. The music was ill fitting and the audio was terrible. Oprah Winfrey is a huge distraction from the role she's supposed to be.The good parts were that I haven't read the book since I was a child and the movie suggested what didn't occur to me at that time. It helps if you have a background in Dungeons and Dragons Planescape, because it seems obvious now that that is essentially what was going on. The guides are celestial angel-types, the traveling is actually through afterlife type worlds where your mind and morality mean more than physics, which is why so much attention is paid to feelings rather than the pittance paid to real world science. For those who don't know Planescape, CS Lewis' Heaven and Hell based scifi is more relevant than Niven or Asimov."
"695",4,"  It was a decent movie with a lot of heart and stunning visuals. There are definitely changes made in the translation from book to screen, some of which work really well and others that personally annoyed me (though I did just reread the book, so it is fresh). Meg's arc especially works well. If you go in with an open mind, this film is very enjoyable."
"696",5,"  Just saw A Wrinkle in Time and it was so beautiful and heart wrenching and I'm ready to watch A Wind in the Door tomorrow. Loved it."
"697",0.5,"  After watched the movie. 2 words...TERRIBLE MOVIE!"
"698",5,"  I spent a long time thinking about this movie after seeing it. I loved the dramatic twist at the end. I love how -evil- was portrayed. it was easy to identify with Meg, our protagonist. the way it played out... parts at the beginning which seemed distastful all tied into the plot later. every moment i was engaged, i didn't know what would happen next. it was refreshingly different from the other movies we've seen, and excellent coming of age story. also Mrs. whatsit, played by reese witherspoon, was fantastic."
"699",5,"  Loved it. Full of heart and inspiration."
"700",4,"  Trying to fit all of the source material into one feature-length film means that a lot of the original action was cut. there is a small pacing problem as a result - lots of buildup, then an almost unbelievably swift resolution. but overall, the film is heartwarming, engaging, evocative, modern, empowering, and stunningly beautiful to look at."
"701",5,"  THis movie was visually stunning, beautiful, poignant and full of heart. If you don't like it I question if you are criticizing because you expected this to be what you thought it would be when you read the book as a child. If you still didn't get it perhaps you did not read the book at all. It was at its core about the power of love, LOVE of family and that of the self. For those upset about its lack of religious undertones...what is Jesus if not love? Have some charity...have a heart...Go see this movie the world is full of critics this has what we all need most... Love and this movie, cast and director have mine!"
"702",0.5,"  Horrible adaptation. They removed the christianity from a Christian fantasy story and replaced it with daytime pop psychology. THey gutted the characterizations of both Mrs. Whatsit and the happy medium. Mrs. Whatsit's attitude towards meg was so annoying! It wouldn't be that hard to make a good film from the book. If they could do it with Harry Potter, they could do it with a wrinkle in time. They would just need to make a longer movie that focused on plot and character, not eye popping cgi! I want a version of A wrinkle in time that includes the twins, the star-gazing rock, and Aunt beastie! I know some changes would be inevitable, but this film actually complicated scenes that could have been simpler and therefore more powerful. The least they could have done to show respect for L'engle and her christian fans was to let them list jesus as a light. He is so much more, but they couldn't even do that. The talented and diverse cast is the only positive thing about this movie.The reason for making a beloved book into a film is having a ready audience in the fans. Why make the book into a movie, then drain it of everything the fans love? Why dumb it down for the sake of CGI? I haven't been so disappointed since the Seeker: The Dark is Rising came out and A wrinkle time made a lot of the same mistakes."
"703",5,"  THIS IS A WONDEFUL ADAPTION OF THE BOOK, and a beautiful film in general. It carries a type of intelligent, unabashedly positive message that we don't see enough of anymore. CLEverly adapted from the book and well written, I COULD have seen my eleven year old self completely enthralled. Even as a somewhat jaded adult, I found myself choking back a tear in several scenes. In the MODERN age of instant Gratification media, a wrinkle in time does something unusual, it takes its time and builds suspense. It also doesn't speak down to its audience. Its a good film for all ages in this viewers opinion. I Will see it again."
"704",0.5,"  Extremely disappointing!!! The heart of this story is the Universal story of good verses evil. The movie narrowed the Moral to a new age teen angst movIe. Madeleine L'Engle is in a genre of christian Fiction author, as the movIe take specific efforts to remoVe any trace of the authors faith. RegardleSs of anyones personal Beliefs this does injust to the authors artwork. Some of the more stUnning and impactful moments in the book were reduced to jokes in the movie. I brought my 8 year old daughter to the movie and even she left disappointed. I never leave reviews for anything and if i do it is only positive. This is the first time i have ever left a negative review for anything. It was that Disapointing."
"705",1,"  Terrible! Nothing like the book. wHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT; A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY."
"706",5,"  Loved it!!! FantastiC movie. I liked that it wasnt OverboArd with constant maximum action overkill. Great meSsages throughout for the self-aware audience."
"707",5,"  I admit, I went into this movie expecting this disappointment of Pete's Dragon, especially after seeing a few reviews giving it a less than stellar number of stars. However, upon leaving the theater, I felt the same lightness and joy I experienced watching Wonder. The film had a deep heart, displaying the power of love and the worth of humans-- and that we can deserve love for being ourselves, rather than constantly striving for approval.A Wrinkle in Time featured charming actors, with Storm Reid stealing the scenes as the persnickety, precocious Meg Murry. Deric McCabe is perfectly cast as the impercetable and brilliant Charles Wallace, while Levi Miller's kind Calvin consistently offers the support Meg needs to save the day. The Mrs.'s, played by Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon, are dazzling, beautiful, wise, brave, and unknowable as they guide the children on first a search and then a rescue mission, giving the children the courage and tools to fight the darkness. I read this book in 5th grade and despised the slow classroom pace and the drying of the novel's appeal with homework and questions. As an English teacher, I revisited the book this past Christmas and quickly devoured others in the series, captivated by the flawed, clever fighter who is Meg Murry. I found permission to be a smart, capable woman as well as permission to live with flaws and not constantly try to cover them up in shame. I found a deeper appreciation for the people around me and a desire to reach out and make the world a better place. While a two hour movie does not allow for the depth of development we find in books, this film adaption does good job of opening many of those doors for viewers. Ryan Coogler's praise for director Ava DuVernay is well earned with a fantastic, diverse cast, beautiful scenery, and spot on emotional appeals. This film will inspire people to love themselves and spread joy, it will inspire viewers to find a solution other than violence, inspire girls to be scientists and dreamers, and inspire us all to look for the wonder just beyond our view."
"708",1,"  So boring and cheesy. No story, bad makeup/costumes, boring predictable dialogue. Both my daughter and I fell asleep half way through when we Realized the Story was going nowhere. Big cast that fell short. Felt like a low budget movie, not Disney like."
"709",1.5,"  OMITTED SO MUCH OF THE BOOK AND ADDED THINGS NOT IN THE BOOK. NOT A BAD MOVIE, BUT NOT REALLY A WRINKLE IN TIME."
"710",1,"  Horrible movie! I left after 10 minutes. Seriously, don't waste your money!!"
"711",5,"  I like the positive message in this movie and the special effects were great also."
"712",0.5,"  Terrible movie. Felt like a low budget spy kids combined with a poorly done baby geniuses movie."
"713",1.5,"  It was WAtchable but wasn't that much fun. could have been so much more. each scene only touched the surface of what the book described. it was criminally deficient."
"714",4,"  A little daRk but a great movie for the kids"
"715",0.5,"  Would have been much Better if it followed the book more closely"
"716",5,"  First and foremost, this is a movie made from a book with kids in mind. There's nothing wrong with that, and that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy the movie too. In a time where we're jam packed with movies and a world filled with explosions, war, death, and bullying, this movie is a heartfelt, comforting hug to anyone who has ever been on the recieving end of unkindess. Either from others or from our own demons. This is an excellent movie for anyone, young and old, in need of a reminder that it's our choices, not our emotions, that define who we are, and that it's never too late to be the best possible version of ourselves. Faults and all."
"717",0.5,"  I probably should have just kept the memory of the book and not gone to the movie. horrible acting, casting and directing. Total disaster. Beyond disappointed."
"718",1,"  Poor acting, extremely cheesy and predictable script, music was not appropriate for the scenes, and just over all confusing and POINTLESS plot:)"
"719",0.5,"  Taking Christianity out of a movie that was supposed to have it in proved to be a mistake!"
"720",2,"  went with 11 yr. old daughter. she said it was ok but a bit scattered. i almost fell ASLEEP multiple times. proceed with caution."
"721",3.5,"  Very emotionally warm movie, really good inspiration. It's not really for adults but I really enjoyed watching it with my daughters. I was really touched by the father daughter scenes. Not as bad as these dumb 1.5 star reviews. If you have young daughters go see it with them."
"722",0.5,"  The most boring movie i have ever seen, the script is bad, screenplay is terrible, the acting was dead, make up was traumatisimg... do not waste your money on THIs ?????"
"723",0.5,"  Movie failed to follow the book and the first halF made no sense!"
"724",0.5,"  PROBABLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. FLAT, DULL CHARACTERS, IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PLOT LINE, UNINTERESTING SPECIAL EFFECTS. A COMPLETE WASTE OF A MOVIE."
"725",0.5,"  Is as bad as the zodiac killer. B-o-r-I-n-g!!!!"
"726",5,"  It wasn't the book, but it was still effective and very artfully done. the acting was amazing, especially from the child characters. it was clear that a lot of heart went into this film."
"727",4,"  this movie made me cry. It started out really slow which made me question my decision of paying extra money for a sneakshow. the fairies just show up out of nowhere to help the family, and the way they travel through dimension was just so easy like everyone can just have superpower whenever they want. So I can see Why it might not appeal to a big chunk of audience because of this. the music blends in nicely with the emotions of the character. The emotional scenes force me not to take eyes off the screen for the second half of the movie."
"728",0.5,"  Absolutely terribleThe amount of CGI used is astounding. It is so far from the book it's painful to watch."
"729",4,"  It was visually stunning and I like the story."
"730",5,"  They stayed true to the book. It's a DIFFICULT concept to protra, so They did an absolutely amazing job. It is meant to be strange and colorful. It was a kId's book! Great job! I hope we get to see another from the series made on the big screen."
"731",5,"  VERY GLAD I DID ""NOT"" PAY ATTention TO THE NEGAtive Reviews!!! I TOOK MY 9 YEAR OLD DAughter TO see, AS PRomised, AND WE BOTH BELIEved IT WAs BEAutiful AND INSPIRAtional - oN MANY levels. A FEEL GOOD MOVIE WITH GREAT LIFE LESSONS FOR YOUNG & OLD ALIKE."
"732",5,"  wonderful movie with meaningful messages about love and life. great acting from all. I never read the book so can only go by what the movie delivered. I Am happy we saw it and even more happy our young children were moved by it."
"733",1.5,"  Some of the cringiest performances I've ever seen in a movie. All from actors who have shown in other films they can act. The blame then, unfortunately, seems to fall on the writer, director, and editor. The costume design is beutiful but in some scenes it becomes obvious that it was decided on with out much consideration with what the actors would actually be doing in the film."
"734",1,"  ""A WRINKLE in time"" is What you get when you cross ""Fried green tomatoes"" with ""Alice in wonderland"". The cast never had a chance. A sad train wreck results when the story attempts to place a girl-talk narrative inside of a disturbing dream, with the added complication that it all happens in outer space somewhere. It felt like i started watching one movie, bought some popcorn, and came back into the wrong THEATER. Spare yourself the head scratching and scratch this one off the to-do list. A colossal waste of time, and too bad for the hard working actors, nobody could have made this mess of a screenplay work."
"735",2.5,"  Parts of this movie are visually dazzling, other parts are predictably sentimental, but it's dreadfully slow (to the point of closing my eyes to sleep). I loved the original book, but not this movie."
"736",0.5,"  Disney should pay me for having to sit through that horrific movie. Movie was Boring, not Funny and horribly casted. My wife and kids were so DISAPPOINTED after loving tHe book. Save your money and time - dont go!"
"737",1.5,"  This MOVIE WAS very slow paced for the first hour and a half. I just like most people who have watched this movie have not seen the book so with that I do not know if they adapted it correctly or not. From my eyes I see a movie that had a cliché beginning, a confusing climax, and a ending that was uninteresting because of the terrible antagonist plus the rush at the end to kill the darkness then get everyone home. a very big problem I had was that they had so many close up shots instead of focusing on the beautiful scenery and really make us feel that we are in this place like we are also in the story. Another thing about this was that the camera man would have the camera shaking in parts when it should have been a still shot. this movie was a dumpster fire and I really wish they could have done better cause I really had high hopes for this movie."
"738",2,"  aside from the great visuals the movie is rushed and too much of the book that made this classic story whole was cut from the movie."
"739",1,"  This Is an absolutely terrible movie. The director says she doesnt care if people dont like it, or dont see it. Listen. To. Her. Dont waste your time."
"740",3,"  I read the book as a child and loved it. I read it again recently with my 10-year-old girl and was put off by the pervasive Christian message. The underlying messaging reminded me in many ways of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis does. The movie does away with the Christian undertones, replacing them with a more subtle new age spirituality. While it still seemed a little hokey, I liked it better than the book."
"741",2,"  Nice story but was actually boring. I would mot watch again."
"742",2,"  This movie was not a total waste of money, but very disappointing! most of the previews, werent even in the movie. Ophah was blah, resse was annoying. It statrs off boRing and never picks up."
"743",1,"  They missed the aspects of the book that explain what's going on. VERY boring and hard to follow. I don't recommend watching."
"744",2.5,"  could have been better."
"745",5,"  missing the Scholarly quotes of the original Book, Bu but a visual feast that brings the storY to life."
"746",5,"  having read the book many times, i loved this adaptation. tells the story in a great way. I really liked it."
"747",1.5,"  The performances are uniformly awful, and they're not helped by claustrophobic overuse of close-ups, an appalling score, and a script that replaces psychological and christian insights with oprah-esque self-help platitudes. Please read the book instead."
"748",1.5,"  The trailers really hype this movie up. The book was great. Bothe myself and the three 11 year old girls I went with, were grossly disappointed. It could and should have been so much more!I felt that they put so much into the special effects but failed to connect to the excitement and depth to the story itself. If they decide to do a sequel, i won't be seeing it."
"749",1,"  A true case of bad casting. Oprah can't pull off ethereal and mysterious no matter how much sparkly make up they put on her. every time she appeared on screen, it took me out of the movie. They've also turned a book with an essentially christian message into one with banal, new age, oprah-ized blather. someone needs to re-do this wonderful story and do it right. kids might like it if they don't know any better and don't know what it's supposed to be. At least they preserved the central message of love's power to save but i was very disappointed. A movie should make you forget that the characters are actors and this movie failed to do that."
"750",0.5,"  Horrible! had to watch, really, and so sad. some wonderful actors who universally do poor jobs. don't waste your time ... don't even wait for it to watch at home. skip altogether!"
"751",1,"  The movie was very very bland."
"752",0.5,"  This is a boring movie. Hard to watch. Feel like I wasted my money."
"753",3,"  I Saw this MoVie yesterday in the theatre. I was very excited going into this movie with big hopes, as being a huge fan of the book. I was Less then impressed. The movie was not neccisarLy bad, In fact it was vIsually gorgeous, but the script just fell Flat. I dont know what it was that didnt Light that movie spark, but i just wasnt into it super much. Enjoyed it, but would definetly not see agAin."
"754",5,"  its the best movie that could ever by made of this particular book - one that blew my mind at age 14. in our forties now, the friends that I went with had mostly read the book and we loved it and were choked up by several scenes. friends that hadn't read the book weren't feeling it, though, so it may not work without the context."
"755",4,"  I thought this was a really good film. The visuals were spectacular. i think the casting was perfect. I had no issues with the Pace or what Some have reFerred to as the ease with which meg saves the day. I didnt come away agreeing with any of those criTicisms i had read in REVIEWS. The story is incredibly powerful and thouGht provoking. Most of the reviews inhave read seem to not be reviewing the film from the persoective of a Childrens targeted sci Fi movie. My 9 and 2 year olds thouroughly enjoyed aS did i and the wife."
"756",0.5,"  Some people saw a movie. All I saw was Oprah's ego. Nice way to ruin a book. Don't waste your time or money. Go see black panther instead."
"757",0.5,"  Wow, so RT is forcing all caps in their review window? Can't seem to turn it off, sorry. Really liked the book, not sure what Disney is trying to do lately. I guess they are into trashing existing properties now? They were doing so incredibly well."
"758",1,"  WORST DISNEY FILM EVER. WOULD DEFINITELY NOT TAKE MY KIDS TO THIS ONE."
"759",5,"  Excellent Movie. Reminds us about want is important!!!"
"760",1,"  WHAT WERE THEY thinking??? never mind that they made some fundamental changes to a classic book (ok, if you do it right), it's just a visual mess. we're supposed to be drawn in by oprah with overdone make-up and saying ""be a warrior."" the terrible tv version was better than this."
"761",1.5,"  They really did a good job on Diversity but over not good. Lots of plot stripped."
"762",3,"  Ok not up to the hype"
"763",5,"  A Wrinkle in Time was so awesome!! I loved it so much. The costumes where so beautiful. Loved the worlds tHEY visited. My boys loved it too. if you have the time you should go see it. Well done and thank you! The whole sound track is epic TOO."
"764",1,"  Should have been paid to sit through this...was that bad!"
"765",0.5,"  Wow, this was so bad i don't even have words"
"766",4,"  Looking forward to reading the book!"
"767",5,"  I will admit it was trying to achieve a lot on a limited amount of time, but it was a great family film meant to be entertaining and thought provoking from a kids perspective."
"768",0.5,"  I wish I had the last two hours of my life back."
"769",2.5,"  You want this movie to be great!! HOWEVER, IT FALLS SHORT OF ALL EXPECTATIONS. VERY CONFSUSING plot. No real ""flow"". YOU will leave FEELING underwhelmed. Political move over talent move?"
"770",4,"  Beautiful and magical"
"771",1,"  I kepT expecting them to put a maga hat on the ""it"". Too pc, too preachy, to. Far from a great book. Why is hollywood turning entertainment to crap to push thEir agendas?"
"772",1.5,"  Very DISAPPOINTED, the previews made it look far better than it was. I love all things disney, but this one, not so much..."
"773",2.5,"  Took my daughters today and it was so-so. It lacked the feeling of the book and a lot of the script choices were odd. I am not sure why they played up the meg/calvin relationship and that was not ""it"". Also, it in no way captured the feeling of real children or families. came off as an after school special that reminded me of wrinkle in time. dissapointed."
"774",4,"  The best part of the movie for me was the 5 minute nap i Got 2/3 of the way through the movie."
"775",3,"  i'M ADDING AN EXTRA STAR FOR cHRIS pINE."
"776",0.5,"  Saw IT today with my hubby ! We loved it! I read the book years ago and am currently rereading it. Like the book, the movie is magical . It has a gr3at message. It tells girls that with courage, love and faith in themselves they can do anything . Amaing costumes and special effects! I'll definitely be buying a Wrinkle in time when it comes out on dvd!"
"777",3,"  IT was visually very beautiful but not a great adaptation of the original storyline."
"778",5,"  this movie was awesome! The cHild In me loved this! Even though the movie was exactly as the book, thEy MaDe it seeM like it was! I would DefInItly recomend you to see this glorious movie!"
"779",0.5,"  My 12 yr old son said worst moviE ever seen and he would giVe minus 10 if he could, and he''s prettu sure that he fell into sleep. I was playing my phone after first hslf hour"
"780",4.5,"  Artistic kids movie with great production and muSical quality. Witty and interesting Until the last minute. Not perfect, but good."
"781",5,"  Leave it to miss Oprah winfrey to know exactly what this country needs right now. this film is more a work of art than a movie. if you gave this masterpiece a low rating you should look in the mirror and be ashamed of yourself."
"782",3.5,"  ACCORDING TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER, THERE WERE FAR TOO MANY ""DUMB SAPPY MOMENTS."" IT ALSO STARTED OUT SLOW AND TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE ADVENTURE. IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK. I WONDER WHY MRS. WHICH DIDN'T CHANGE HER SIZE AND HOW DID THEY GET SUCH A LARGE ACTOR?"
"783",3,"  We took our two girls, ages 3 and 6, to see this. it was a bit over the 3-y.o.'s head but our 6 y.o. enjoyed most of it. the moral is a bit complex and we would it a bit slow to get started. the acting (mostly of the ""the Mrs'"", was mediocre and left us feeling like we were missing something. It was entertaining to see this classic on screen and overall, we enjoyed it. definitely a few misses though."
"784",0.5,"  Feels like a liberal lecture the whole movie. I cannot understand how it has any good reviews. It makes me wonder if the ratings are artificially boosted."
"785",0.5,"  Not impressive at all! Lots Of hype and movie Was awful! Needed more story better acting and less in your face trippy effects that really didnt fit."
"786",5,"  Loved it! i have no clue why there are negative reviews. Visually stunning and emotionally uplifting. Takr your kids to see it - this film is for them"
"787",1,"  We just got back from this film and I have to say I really wanted to like it. Having read the books with my boys and loving that experience, i thought this would be a surefire hit with me. It was not. Disney and Director ava duvernay seemed to want to focus more on diversity and political correctness as opposed to the source material. I just really wish hollywood would get back to making films for the sake of entertainment."
"788",5,"  Great Movie! Visually stunning with a great message, especially for young people. Loved it!"
"789",5,"  Despite the biased criticism, I chose to see this MOVIE. This movie makes You think and feel. Then QUESTIONs why you are feeling what you feel. It propels you to take self inventory. Forcing you to unapologetically admit your flaws. Understanding, the very things that flaws your canvas, can be the catalyst used to aid your conquest in conquering your ""It."" If you can eat the meat and throw away the bones, you'll extract a valuable jewel, ""Love conquers all."""
"790",1,"  tHE PREVIEWS FOR THIS MOVIE WAS ONLY oPRAH AND THE DIRECTOR AND THE CAST TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT THE MOVIE WAS. iT REALLY NEVER SHOWED ANY PARTS OF THE MOVIE. I THINK THEY KNEW HOW BAD THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE RECIEVED. I THINK THIS WILL LET SOME OF THE AIR OUT OF oPRAH. tHE PUBLIC KNOWS WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS BAD. iN THIS CASE THE MOVIE HAD NO REAL DIRECTION. tHE COSTUMES AND MAKE-UP WERE OVER THE TOP. iT WAS A DISTRACTION TO SAY THE LEAST. tHE ACTING WAS NOT EFFECTIVE. yOU GOT THE SENSE THAT EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE WAS ADRIFT...LOST. tHIS DIRECTOR DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. mAKING A MOVIE TO ONLY SATISFY YOUR POLITICAL AGENDA AND THEN ANNOUNCE TO THE PUBLIC IT DOES NOT MATTER IF IT MAKES MONEY...WELL THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH Disney AND ITS STOCK HOLDERS WILL BE GREATLY AFFECTED. I WONDER HOW MUCH MONEY OPRAH HAD IN THE PROJECT.? tHE MOVIE WAS BAD. nO GETTING AROUND THAT. I HEARD MORE GROANS AND SAW MORE PEOPLE WALK OUT OF THIS MOVIE THAN I HAVE SEEN SINCE THE TWILIGHT FILMS. tHIS MOVIE STINKS. won't BE THE FIRST AND WON'T BE THE LAST."
"791",4,"  A great movie for kids, that's easy for adults to watch, too."
"792",0.5,"  SO VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS FILM. BETWEEN BAD SOUND, confusing STORY TELLING, AND EITHER, OVER OR UNDER ACTING BY PRETTY MUCH EVERY CHARACTER, ALONG WITH LOOOOONG AND OVER-EMOTIONAL INTERLUDES THAT DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING TO THE STORY, we and our audience, kids included, were bored and let down by this soap-opera like movie, that potentially could have been great.."
"793",1,"  Nothing like the book"
"794",4.5,"  Our whole family liked it (girls age 9 and 12, as well as mom and dad). I enjoyed the lighting and color in the film. I thought the casting was good. I found Oprah's larger-than-life-character interesting. No complaints."
"795",5,"  i ENJOYED THE MOVIE THAN BLACK PANTHER. PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM A FAN OF THE BOOK AND AUTHOR, AND AM NOT A FAN OF THE mARVEL STORYLINES AND FILMS. MY GUESS IS THAT THOSE WHO CRITICISED THE MOVIE HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK OR COULD APPRECIATE THE PLOT. INSTEAD, THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM WERE EXPECTING AN ACTION-PACKED THRILLER, BUT INSTEAD, FOUND THEMSELVES WATCHING A TOUCHING STORY ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL FINALLY ACCEPTING HER IMAGE."
"796",1,"  Long story short...funny, I wish it was! No effort acting, poorly directed (did she even read the book?!) and LOOOONNNGGG. A dumpster fire through and through..."
"797",3.5,"  This Movie was, for me, a beautiful tribute to the book. As a child, the book was a sci-fi thriller that highlighted the strngth of children, the bond between sibLings, aNd the longing For parental love & attention. The young actors were mesmerizing. The actor playing Charles wallace was adorable as the Young genius who Adores his siSter and quite scary as the it-influenced villan! The casting was superb although oprah didnt seem to disappear into the role of mrs. Which as much as mrs. Which became oprah. The other flaw was the Far too quick redemption of charles wallace when Meg's love pulls him back from the brink. That said, this book is a Breath-takIng view of child imagination and wonder. SOmething we could all do well to focus on a little more these days."
"798",0.5,"  It honesTly was one of the most boring movie ive ever seen. Not worth tHe time to watch."
"799",1,"  A horrible and confusing movie. Your kids will constantly ask what is happening. I only watched it because it was a double feature at the drive in."
"800",1,"  Could have bee much better if they were try to b so POLITICALLY CORRECT."
"801",2,"  yeah not impressed. And oprah was really bad in this. Her acting sucked and the metallic makeup and goofy costuming was ridiculous. This one isn't worth your money"
"802",0.5,"  It's hard to imagine this movie could have been any worse. I must admit, after 35 minutes I walked out. The writing was horrid and the the directing equally bad. The sound design was flattened and the story was all tell and no show. IT's the sort of kids film that expects children to need everything hand fed to them. It treats this like an opportunity to teach kids the values of love conquering all. It's the sort of thing that shows how little adults sometimes know how to speak to children."
"803",4,"  This was an excellent children's film. I'm seeing a lot of hate thrown its way for that fact, but that's what the book was, a children's book, and that's what the film is, as well. If you still have a bit of your younger self in you, then let them out to play, and you'll enjoy this film. It's not super complicated, but it's beautiful, and its simplicity is refreshing and fun if you let it be. the leads, storm reid, levi miller, and deric mccabe, all gave excellent performances. The supporting staff mostly did well, though there were a few issues there. But overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend going to see it. especially if you have children, and even moreso if you have a daughter or daughters. bring them! this film will almost certainly become one of their favorites."
"804",4,"  I must respectfully disagree with my husband. This movie was AMAZING. It is my opinion that this movie is for the unaccepted. The ones who feel alone and have *almost* allowed darkness to take over their light.No movie is perfect and yet, just as the main character Meg discovers, there is beauty and power in one's faults...I personally feel that it is just as powerful as Black Panther, but on different scale.Storm,Oprah, Ava...job well done."
"805",1,"  Completely different from the original L'Engle story . Not good in any way."
"806",2.5,"  This movie is for kids."
"807",5,"  I REALLY liked it! Is it the same as the book? No, of Course not. Are there some things I wish they had included? Absolutely. But, go see it! do Not expect the director to have imagined the story the way you did as a child. It's different, but good! I loved the diverse cast, the contemporary settings - it all worked. and in the end, it is about an incredible young girl finding her strength."
"808",1,"  Save your money and don't waste it on this move. This is the first disney movie that i did not like.Hard to follow. because of such Simple plot and lack of story line; the scenes are dragged too long to fill the time. Graphics are amazing but these days this is not an accomplishment. Story line misses pieces and parts and you keep saying what happened to the brother, boyfriend, Father and etc. Quite frankly it jumps form one scene to another with no logical RELATIVITY. I actually heard the guy behind my saying ""Was everyone on acid when making the film?""Wait for it to become available online or DVD so you can fast forward without filling guilty that you paid 20 Bucks for it and have see it to the end"
"809",0.5,"  I think Ms. L'engle would like this adaptation even less than she did the 2003 one. I hated it."
"810",5,"  i am going to preface this review by saying i have not read the book. I enjoyed this movie very much. However i do not believe this movie would bE appropriate for young children."
"811",1,"  Movie was terrible. I will never get the hour and a 1/2 of my life back, I left the theater angry that I spent the money, save the money and time,"
"812",2,"  Poorly executed. Lacked heart and feLl flat."
"813",0.5,"  Because it had Oprah, Disney probably thought it would be a blockbuster, not! more like a bomb. big waste of time and money to see this."
"814",0.5,"  This movie is terrible. Lots of CGI but each scene is so random and lackin in purpose. The kis find their lost father with no trouble at all. The father leaves his kids in an evil place because he's scared? This movie makes no sense. The director needs to start over. IT is such a waste of time for the Family. Unfortunately it is overhyped it will probably make a lot of money and then be quickly forgotten."
"815",4,"  I really liked the movie, interesting story lines and important messages about life and courage. visually stunning!"
"816",1,"  Not a good movie at all."
"817",2,"  The effects were good, but the writing was over the top cheesie. I was disappointed."
"818",2,"  Such a visual spectacle with parts that will keep you warm. But it sadly misses the mark when it comes to STORYTELLING."
"819",1.5,"  ONe word: YUCK. This movies proves 3 things: 1. not all disney is great; 2. not all all-star cast movies are great, and; 3. it matters how the pieces of the movie is edited."
"820",1,"  Most disappointed. beautiful cast, vibrant or potentially vibrant story fell short. seemed stale before act one was finished. i was never sure what i was watching or what i was waiting for to happen. the act structure was weak. sure was hoping for a home run. i don't even want to waste a good tomato on this one. god please don't let them screw up frozen 2. if they can keep from stealing other people's plot lines, it should be good."
"821",2.5,"  DISAPPOINTED. Loved the costumes, cast and some of the scenes with special graphics. SAW it in 3D so the Parts that were animated were fun to watch but the movie is nothing like the book - nothing LIKE it. They took an amazing book and destroyed it on SCREEn. They left out parts, changed characters and sort of morphed the message. If you didn't read the book, you may not actually understand it but if you did read the book, you may be confused because it is LACKIng.This movie is getting major publicity because of Oprah. I feel like it's AN attempt to keep her RELEVANT. The actress who plays the main character is a Disney channel familiar face whos talent is over rates and again, another change because in the book the main character is Completely different both in appearance and personality.It's not worth your money to see in the theater. Wait until it comes out on Netflix or redbox."
"822",5,"  Great color. Beautiful emotion. Brought to 2018 with style. Perfect family movie. Recommended!"
"823",1,"  Beautiful visuals. Terrible story."
"824",4,"  I grew up on the books, to see some it on the big screen was kinda fun"
"825",2,"  THOUGH THE STORY LINE WAS INTERESTING, IT WAS NOT ORIGINAL. THE EFFECTS WERE PRETTY GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. AND IT WAS A BIT TOO FLUFFY"
"826",5,"  It''s a WELL done movie with a lesson of life and the best performance of Reese Witherspoon ever she alone should get a nomination for this movie"
"827",5,"  THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE."
"828",0.5,"  CRap leftist propaganda..."
"829",0.5,"  I went into this knowing that it would not be true to the book and would be a Disney-ized version of a great story. I did not realize how over-the-top the delivery would be from experienced actors. The 3 Mrses delivered their lines with an unnatural almost preachy zeal. I wonder if this was intentional, what the director was looking for. The young actors did great, Reid, Miller and especially Deric McCabe. Galifianakis' gives a good performance. Perhaps being a 'Happy Medium' he did not have to over-state like the other experienced actors. I think Peña is a great actor. His character lacks real antagonism but I suspect that is to keep it friendly for small children. The ending/climax happens quickly without proper setup/build, but this is good, because you will want to get out of there quicker. The movie was very corny, even for younger audience. We went for the visual effects, as much of the $100 million budget was spent in that department. Saw it in Real3D, thinking this would be stunning/mesmerizing. I was disappointed."
"830",5,"  I highly recommend this movie!!! I Have never written a review before, but i felt this movie deserves it!!! It's a positive movie with so much depth!!! I loved it!!!! Amazing movie!!!!"
"831",5,"  amazing movie, i loved it. However, I feel like if you haven't read the book or understand physics, a lot of the subtle beauty of the movie will be lost on you. don't hate something just because you don't understand it :)"
"832",5,"  I absolutely loved the movie! My young nieces enjoyed it as well. I'll be going back to see it again this weekend."
"833",0.5,"  The diversity of the cast or the modernization of the home were not an issue for me. I don't really care if characters don't look the way they are described in a book. What I did hate was the pace of the movie and the lack of depth to any of the characters. Everything moves quickly, characters are introduced clumsily and nothing about what makes each character special ever feels believable. The CGI is plentiful yet cheesy. My 5 year old wanted to leave halfway through, my 12 year old practically feel asleep and both us adults were disappointed so I'm not sure what age group this movie was targeted for but it missed the mark. 103 million spent on costume and CGI"
"834",0.5,"  Not sure the movie makers even read the book as The lackluster script has little resemblance to the ample material it provided. And whats going on with all the glitter and rhinestones! Apparently the twins were irrelevant as were most of the thoughtful details of madeleine d'engle's work."
"835",5,"  iT WAS a great family movie. My kids enjoyed it and so did I."
"836",4,"  a Wonderfully cast adaptation of a great book. i really enjoyed seeing the characters brought to life. i take off one star because i think some of the situations or characters could be CONFUSING for someone who hadn't read the book already. But for wrinkle fans I think it's a must see."
"837",5,"  I don't know what movie some of these critics saw, but I thought Duvernay knocked this one out of the ballpark. The movie was fantastic, and I think it will become this century's ""Wizard of Oz."""
"838",3,"  It was interesting. That's all I could make of it."
"839",2,"  personally i think THAT this movie does not do the book justice. It has a wonderful cast and a great director but just couldn't conect with the audience very well. It is missing the spark that the book has that makes you feel for the characters. It is also trying to hard to appeal to this generation by making it more futuristic but overall losing the feeling the story was supposed to have."
"840",1,"  Good visuals, good effects, nice soundtrack, good actors, even the kids are good. EVERYTHING else sucks. Bad pacing, CONVOLUTED direction, boring and over the top at the same time, terrible camera angles, some of the worst. Why is every shot two inches from the actors face in every shot? 4/10 stars from me."
"841",2,"  I just hope Our kids had a good time."
"842",0.5,"  Disjointed and boring. Do not waste your time"
"843",4,"  I went with my daughter. When we got iut if the movie she said she wanted to be a better sister. Wins in my book other than that the story is kindA all over the place."
"844",3,"  The quintessential oprah message about conquering your inner demons, loving and believing in yourself and others. In many ways like a modern wizard of oz. Visually appealing and a positive message kept simple for the target audience, primarily preteen girls."
"845",1,"  Do not waste your money or time!!! Worst movie in the last 20 years I have Seen."
"846",1,"  This movie is lost in space about being lost in space!"
"847",1,"  It makes No sense and is a bad movie in general. 10/10 reccomond you stay at home and spend your money on SoMeThing better"
"848",4,"  While I feel that a lot of the more scientific elements of the book were dropped to make it more digestible for a general audience, overall it was a good film. I loved the characters; they were all well developed. And the visuals were just amazing."
"849",5,"  I thought the movie was a good family movie..."
"850",4.5,"  MY daughter is 10. I believe she is the target audience of Disney's reimagined version of the book. She has not read the book yet. So, from her point of view, this movie was fantastical, beautiful and FULL of truth. It gives a physical form to the negativity in the world which helped her understand the concepts being explained. She loved watching a movie where the main character is female and close to her age, and Seeing a family With an adopted member, because she is adopted. After it was over she immediately wanted to watch it again.I gave it a 4 1/2 because she loved it SO much, but for me there were a few parts that seemed to drag out to long and I have read the BOOK. Also, I thought, the part of Calvin needed a little bit more explanation instead of him just showing up in front of Mrs. Who's house to meet Meg and Charles Wallace."
"851",3,"  Went to go see it for my daughter's birthday, & I had let her read my copy of the story beforehand, she asked me why it was too Disney & not exactly like the book...... So she liked it but didn't love it...... It's a good family movie for anyone who hasn't read the story yet...... I wouldn't see it again at the theatre, but if it comes on TV I'll see again......"
"852",0.5,"  ThiS was one of the worst movies ive ever Seen. There was multiple people that walked out of the movie not even an hour into it. A complete waste of time and it was so bad that it was tRuly laughable at times. I would highly not recommend this movie to anyone. Save your cash or watch something else. Whoever gave this movie the go Ahead should be fired IMMEDIATELY and banned forever. I would give this a rating of negative five stars but its not an option. Its so bad that it makes you feel uncomfortable. If i havent Convinced you of how bad this movie sucks, go waste two hours of your life and find out."
"853",3,"  Visually Stunning. Hair, make up, costumes were all amazing. The story just comes across as meh. Great message but i feel like big chunks of the movie was missing. Also why is the brother and the guy friend even there? they add ABSOLUTELY nothing to the movie."
"854",0.5,"  The most borring film ever."
"855",5,"  EVERY CLIP I'VE SEEN IS WONDERFULLY EXECUTED AND THE DIRECTORS CREATED A PHENOMENAL Adaptation, even more gorgeous that the original screenplay. I especially enjoyed seeing this portrayal where more characters are poc, as i thought that tied into my personal experience very nicely."
"856",1.5,"  Just not that interesting and felt rushed, pretty to the eyes tho."
"857",1.5,"  I almost forgot that Disney Films has a branch devoted to kids. A Wrinkle In Time is aimed narrowly at a pre-teen female demographic. This is a pretty weak story wrapped in some heavy production design. The 3 Mrs-es, played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey don't really stretch anyone's acting chops. Zach Galifianakis is along for the ride. That made me say, ""uh ... hmm?"" The movie rests heavily and somewhat uncomfortably on the shoulders of its young stars, Storm Reid and Derec McCabe. Director Ava DuVernay failed to bring out subtley or clarity in Reid's young girl who wants to reunite with her father. McCabe is miscast as an awkwardly named Charles Wallace. The performance is further damaged by bad sound mixing for his vocal range, such that a number of his lines get lost in a mumbly undertone. He has to turn evil for a while, and it's just a mess. There is another young actor playing a character of Calvin, who seems to be along for no reason whatsoever, and whom the screenplay seems to forget about for a really long time about 2/3rds in. This movie needed to be either more completely realistic or more completely fantastical. It could be that this movie is just lost to my AARP age bracket, but sadly I say that despite the pile of Disney money on screen, it lacks the magic of something like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is clearly best example of what it might have been aiming for. Even Michael Penã couldn't save this one."
"858",1,"  Dumbfounded at how boring and non intelligent this film was. Disney completely missed the mark on this one and produced drivel for toddler mentality. Dont waste your movie dollars."
"859",1,"  Worst movie disney has ever made! Slow, confusing, dumb! Not even worth a $3.99 rental. I want the 2 hours of my life back, and my 40 bucks!"
"860",5,"  A bold, heartfelt, touching film that succeeds on many levels. bravo!"
"861",5,"  Wow! This movie was simply stunning and such a powerful piece. When yoU go see it go iN with an open heart, opeN mind, and open imagination and allow yourself to be taken on a very deep aNd personal journey!"
"862",1.5,"  Don't wast your money...."
"863",0.5,"  The only age this may appeal to is young children or tweens...maybe. This is not a movie for all ages. The tone in the theater was so odd as ppl were laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be laughed at. We were clearly not the target demo. Older book readers will be throughly disappointed. It's the one time I've considered walking out. Save your money or see Black Panther instead."
"864",1,"  I don't review movies, but I was so disappointed and upset with the amount of time this movie stole from me. the character development was poor at best. i felt no connection to any of them, nor did i feel the characters connected to each other. the visual effects were beautiful, but felt like they were there just to be there, not because it meant anything. horrible movie!"
"865",5,"  This is a great movie!! Its deep, well acted and INSPIRATIONAL."
"866",5,"  a beautiful movie and a must see for girls everywhere! so beatiful and full of fantasy :)"
"867",0.5,"  No, simply no! Oprah can't act. Ruined a great book."
"868",5,"  BEAUTIFUL, FANTASTICAL, AND FILLED WITH HUMANITY. I LOVED THE METAPHOR FOR THE BATTLES WE FIGHT WITHIN OUR MIND. AVA'S VISION WAS WELL FORMED AND EXPANSIVE."
"869",5,"  The most inspiring film ive ever taken my son to"
"870",2,"  Disney made a bad mistake by Putting their name with this movie. It was terrible. The movie was dragged out so long just to get to the plot. FiRSt movie in my life that i lIterally fell asleep to in the movie theater."
"871",5,"  Such an INSPIRIng fIlM for people of all ages. Teaches the im of Self worth"
"872",5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is tremendously entertaining and deep at the same time. Beautifully made, terrific acting, great story, and profound meaning at many levels, I left the theater feeling grateful. I give it the highest recommendation."
"873",1,"  the imagery in this movie was by far the best thing going for it. It was all over the place. The message was confusing. The acting was mediocre. I did not like it. Not to mention it dragged on and on. It was truly about 25 minutes too long."
"874",5,"  I thouGht the movie was amazing. I was not eXpecting it to be so emotional. It takes you on a journey of sElf AcceptancE. It was tailored to young adults but i eNjoyEd it. It was exciting and Funny. I loved the cinematography and the costumes in The film."
"875",0.5,"  I wish I could wrinkle time and get my time and money back. Disney drops the ball with this flick."
"876",3,"  this film does have an impressive cast and a fascinating premise albeit a complicated one even for kidsnewcomer storm reid plays Meg, a girl who lost her father 4 years ago for discovering a new way to move through time and space by creating wrinkles with our mindsher mother, her adopted brother are hurting but a visit from 3 women convince her that her father is alive and well and she has the power to fight off a great evil in the universeOprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Zach Galafinakis, Chris Pine, Rowan Blanchard, and Gugu MBatha-Raw are excellentagain Storm Reid steals the movie with her presence and that her flawed personality may be of more use to most than somethe visuals are outstanding and this expanded universe should please the little onesthe soundtrack is really good as wellit's just that a lot of the story feels rather rushed though considering the book is full of deep Christian themesdirector Ava DuVernay knows how to handle the family dynamic and that we should push ourselves past our fears and insecurities, you can face the uneasy answers, just not avoid themwe all have the potential to open our minds and let love guide us through the impossiblethe film is good, not great at tackling sensitive subjects even if the translation is somewhat loststill it does make us re-look at our own reality a bit further and with the wonders of the universe"
"877",0.5,"  Honestly had so many expectations for this movie. I was looking forward to Mindy KAILing part and they gave her the stupidest lines. Even Oprah was pointless in THis movie. Just a huge disappointment..... Why AVA why ????"
"878",5,"  My daughter and i both loved it. I am a long-time fan oF the book and very happy to see it as a movie. I thought they did a great job, i was lost in the movie."
"879",5,"  It was great watch it made me cry my heart out it was wonderful"
"880",5,"  Great message, fun creative tale which did a good interpretation of the book. Well doNe"
"881",0.5,"  Worst movie ive paid to see."
"882",4,"  Enjoyed it, have been waiting for years for an adaptation."
"883",2,"  Dissapointing. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" suffers from a lot of flaws. To be honest, I'm surprised the script got passed by the producers. It's weird but the exhibition in this film is either too much or not enough, so I was at either ""I get it, move on!"" or ""Wait, what!? Explain!."" The dialogue among the humans just doesn't sound like how regular human beings speak. It doesn't help that the kids who play the three main characters aren't good actors. The two boys in particular are wanting. Between the acting and the dialogue, the love interest kid is a wedged-in, purposeless dummy, and the super-intelligent younger brother is obnoxiously precocious and a bit hard to understand sometimes.The film does have some strong parts. All the big name actors who play the alien beings did a great job. In fact, this was probably my favorite performance by Reece Witherspoon as a weird, unintentionally rude alien. Visually, the effects, the costumes, and sets are all a joy to watch. Lot of creativity there.In fact, I liked the second act. The focus on the aliens and other planets are when things got good. Unfortunately, the third act focuses on the human characters again and falls into the mistakes of the drawn-out first act.Kids may enjoy the visuals here, but If you're a parent be prepared to be bored for part of this."
"884",3,"  Meh - could have been much much better."
"885",5,"  Wrinkle in time was Extraordinary .. everyone should see it"
"886",0.5,"  I loved this book (and trilogy) as a child and thought I would take my kids to see it. It reminded me of a bad Nickelodeon TV show. EVen with the big budget effect. Some of which were good. Winfrey is just goofy and it was not true to the original feeling of the book, at all. I sort of suspected that but went with an open mind. Popcorn was good."
"887",2.5,"  Great cast. Good visuals. Poor storytelling.Major plotlines left in the dust. Character introductions are at a minimum. People unfamiliar with the book will be lost. Fans of the book will be upset.*spoilers*no twins Whatsit's transformation is not right No backstory is given as to the fact that the Mrs. were stars. You think they're going to do it, but they literally fall short.Aunt Beast is a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment. They should have just cut it altogether. The ""It"" planet is hardly recognizable. The beige neighborhood exists for about 2 minutes, before everything literally changes. The city is now a beach.The characters go from Earth to their first alien world, to Happy Medium, to Camazots, back to Earth. That's it.This movie could have used at least another half hour of story, and the it might have been good."
"888",1,"  painfully Terrible movie. Terrible story, terrible directing, terrible editing, terrible acting, even the soundtrack was terrible. I don't know what they were thinking. The whole movie was silly and sappy and bluntly manipulative, kind of like Spielberg's horrible ""Hook"" but much worse. The critics were being inexplicably kind to give it as high a rating as they did."
"889",5,"  mY KIDS LOVED THIS MOVIE. i THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD ADVENTURE MOVIE."
"890",1.5,"  The visuals, while often quite imaginative seemed at the same time stale and extravagant. Most all the scenes lacked drama and direction and the only clear element was the consistent, indicative insistence on the film's themes of love and self acceptance. A great premise with great themes, but ultimately an aimless missed opportunity."
"891",5,"  I Truly enjoyed watching a wrinkle in time. It was Beautifully made and I was on the edge of my sit."
"892",1,"  UNDERWHELMING, slow moving story Line and possibly the worst movie I've seen in some TIME. I wasted my $$$ to see it. Really, do t bother to see it. I would have preferred to clean my bathrooms all afternoon long instead of watching this movie. Read the book."
"893",5,"  I Thought this was an ABSOLUTELY beautIful aNd EMPOWERING movie. It was pure mAgic on the screen That covered such deep, powerful , important messages. I loved the book as a kid and i just lOved this movie. It was such a SPECIAL Experience to go with My 9 year old son who also loved it. I highly recOmmend seeing it (ignore the Negative REVIEWS and choose light)."
"894",0.5,"  Sadly, this movie would make more sense if you eliminated all sound and make up your own dialogue to the movie visuals."
"895",1,"  The original book is confusing so the movie is just a joke. But so tolerant one."
"896",5,"  Loved it. Went with my 9 year old GRANDDAUGHTER who loved it."
"897",0.5,"  Another Disney bomb!""L'Engle calls A Wrinkle in Time her ""psalm of praise to God."" In Wrinkle, Jesus is made to look as if he is on the same level as Buddha and Gandhi. Charles Wallace, the main character in the book, asks the angel, ""Who have our fighters been?"" The angel quotes John 1:5, then Charles shouts out in response, ""Jesus! . . . The angel replies: ""Go on Charles, there were others. All your great artists... His friend Calvin then adds to the list, confidently calling out Gandhi and Buddha...Children reading L'Engle's fiction are getting her theology whether they want it or not. Placing Jesus' name along with Gandhi and Buddha was not a mistake."""
"898",0.5,"  This was a disaster. I don;t even want to waste my time writing anything further."
"899",0.5,"  Total garbage. I can't believe i wasted my money on this film. My kids hated it, and we hated it. Who hired the talentless director who made this steaming pile of crap?"
"900",1,"  I don't even know what to say. Not for kids, not for adults; costumes and make up is not good; mysic not good; characters are not deep; hard to connect with anything about this movie. I was waiting to Really connect with the message and aonegow that got lost too. Very bummed as i wanted to love it. Sonebody pay a bonus to the editor that cut the trailer for doibg an excellent job of making this movie look great."
"901",0.5,"  If the author of the book were alive, she would be very sad, AS the movie totally departed from the underlying message of the book."
"902",1,"  Reese witherspoon and the girl from the office were terrIble!!! CHeesy, horrible Acting and oBnoxious, boring chAracTers. Would be so much better without Them and too familiar oprah!!"
"903",4,"  I saw this film today. Awesome message. Young actors were terrific. Not sure if it is right for very young children. Still left me wanting more. Not sure why"
"904",1,"  total waste of time. Wish there had been a tesseract to cross that whole movie instantly and go see jumanji again."
"905",0.5,"  this is an absolutely terrible film."
"906",4,"  Great inspirationThis movie is great encouragement to go beyond limitations. It brought beautiful imagery. I would recommend it."
"907",5,"  Storm Reid captured the angry, awkward, unhappy brave Meg Murry better than anyone I could imagine. And this movie. It is so much about love between siblings. That agonizing, impossible, gut-level love. Calvin O'Keefe and Charles Wallace were perfectly cast. The Witches were modernized and younger than I'd imagined them for sure, but they were still glorious.There were a few issues with the book, which I won't mention because of spoilers. But the movie fixed them ALL and made the entire story so much stronger.Madeleine L'Engle would be proud, I am so so sure of it.Now: this movie has girl cooties all over it. PLEASE GO SEE IT IN THE THEATERS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I want us to show that movies for GIRLS (not women, necessarily, but GIRLS) are worth putting money and time into."
"908",1.5,"  Too concered about making a point to tell the story. Eyes are sore from rolling up into my skull."
"909",3.5,"  This was my favorite pre-teen book and I read it again knowing the movie was coming out. I found the book to be clunky on my second reading but I could see why i loved it. The movie was clunky but in a different way from the book. I think that it just never achieved the great relationships that each character in the movie had with meg. and definitely did not show the true quirkiness of charles wallace. I wanted to love it, but I rate it better than okay."
"910",0.5,"  Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"911",0.5,"  Cult of oprah crap. they took a wonderful book and ruined it."
"912",0.5,"  What a disappoinment - Terrible, terrible, terrible. I love scifi but this movie is awful."
"913",0.5,"  waaaay to pc for me."
"914",5,"  Great Kids movie with Alot of heart, fun visuals and overall enjoyable story."
"915",5,"  AMAZING!!!! Visually stunning!!!! Everyone needs to see this movie, especially children and teens."
"916",0.5,"  Varies far too much from the book. Doesnt have the cohesion of the book or purpose of being. So many elements.changed or eliminated that it is barely Recognizable as related to the book. If you enjoyed the book, Steer clear of the movie"
"917",1,"  If you have reaD the books, dont watch this movie! ItS horrib abd helf sovmuch out and added so much that the book dodnt have. This was a conplete heart break beamcause i had been waiting over 10 years for this movie! I live the books and could not wait to see the movie. I was So upset when i wayched last night!"
"918",0.5,"  Shame on you disney. inAppropriate for kids and too wierd and stUpid for adults. Waste of time and money."
"919",2.5,"  When I heard Ava was directing, I downloaded the audiobook and listened when I used to trek to work. I really couldn't get into the story, mainly because of the style of writing and the way the characters talked to each other. I never finished it. After seeing what I saw today I can only say that this particular story does not lend itself to adaptation easily. There are shots in this film that you'd see in an oscar nominated film which can only be created by Ava. But the surrounding story tries to drown it out. That being said, coming out of the theater I had the strongest desire to see a Wizard of Oz movie directed by Ava DuVernay. All of the elements and techniques were in this film to make the latter something special. Even keeping some of the same cast.I know this film was not for my particular demographic, and that it has a very important message weaved throughout. But a good movie needs a good script and when the book that script is based on is an acquired taste in itself, a universally loved product is a difficult goal."
"920",5,"  This movie was absolutely beautiful. For those who have not read the book, you should, as the meaning of the movie will mean much more. I cried through the whole thing due to how powerful the message was. I want to commend Ava duvernay as this movie beautifully BEtrayed women of color and the courage to be oneself. Beautifully done."
"921",1,"  The only good thing about this movie was the source material. The acting, directing and overall story telling of this move was aweful and its also too scary for young children stay away"
"922",1.5,"  Feels like half a movie since Its all set up with no rEal pay off."
"923",1,"  I was super excited to see this movie, but like everything hollywood does it falls short of being similar to the book. The best parts of the book were taken out to EMPHASIS UNINTERESTING aspects. if it wouldn't have been for my 5 year old poking me every few minutes to ask if we could go somewhere else I probably would have fallen asleep in the movie...."
"924",1,"  Not very well done. the story leave a lot to be desired. reese witherspoon was good in her part, but not much I cared for in this movie."
"925",4.5,"  We really enjoyed this movie! Following Meg on her adventure through the universe to find her father and discover the power within herself was so fun. It was also a great reminder that our imperfections are a part of us and that we are worthy of RECEIVING and giving love. This is a great movie for parents to take the pre-teens and teens to see. If you want a discussion guide to use afterwards we have one up on our blog right now. The imagery was stunning and the characters were cast well! Yes, it was not exactly like the book- but I was not expecting it to be and I was not DISAPPOINTING. The theme of light and love shone through. We highly RECOMMEND this movie."
"926",1,"  as time passed I cared less and less about the characters and the plot. I finally stopped caring completely and left about 10 min. to go."
"927",3.5,"  This film has attracted a lot of negative reviews, but I think folks are being Way too harsh. I enjoyed the movie, and I really liked the lead actress who played Meg Murry--hope to see more of her. I like the scoring too, which OCCASIONALLY mixed in standard orchestral fare with some light R&B tunes for a very fresh effect. My favorite scene involved the three kids stuck in an empty white room--and she uses some special lenses gifted to her to find a set of invisible stairs leading up to her trapped father. Graphically and musically a very Artfully done scene. Two things which I didn't like. I felt Mindy kaling was miscast, mainly because it's so hard for me to see her outside her typical comedy roles. But no real problem with her performance per se. Second is the way the three ""mrS"" were introduced. It was just too sudden, jarring and unconvincing. These are some really wierd people (by normal standards)--but they just appear out of nowhere and are fully accepted by the main cast so quickly! No questions asked! If any part of the movie makes it feel like a ""kids movie"", it's this weak early introductory sequence. But after that bumpy intro I did find myself getting immersed into the beautifully rendered worlds."
"928",1,"  The movie is slow to bUild, choppy anD quite dull in its character adapTation. Read the book instead."
"929",0.5,"  This was just awful The acting, dialog, lousy adaptation, and early 80s special effects. We just wanted out. Blech. Not even worth a rent."
"930",0.5,"  I watched this movie entirely and i still don'T understand what happened. The acting from Levi Miller was trUly atrocious and the movie would have been fine without him. The only enjoyment i got from this movie was making fUn Of it."
"931",0.5,"  Lost THE HEART AND STORY OF THE BOOK."
"932",1,"  Don't waste your money!"
"933",2.5,"  way too much footage spent on cameos of the Pretty cast. not enough action, Acting was fine but the story became dull by way too many slow-moving cameo scenes. Would have like to seen more place traveled to. not good for children under 9. Costumes, make-up, & special effect nicely done good."
"934",0.5,"  I would give it zero sTars but they Don't have that optiIon."
"935",5,"  It was amazing. I was sobbing the entire movie. The visuals are stunning and the performances of the actors are superb, especially storm reid as me'g and reese witherspoon aS mrs. whatsiT. Dont buy into these cynical naysayers. See It for yourself! Its a beautiful movie and will now forever be kne of my fscorites!!"
"936",0.5,"  Not worthy of Disney name. Scrambled boring movie."
"937",5,"  Great children's film with fun visuals and a Heart-warming story. Perfect for taking your dangerous girls to!"
"938",4,"  NOT PERFECT BUT GREAT. SOME PARTS I ENJOYED MORE THAN THE BOOK. SOME PLOT HOLES BUT...THE BOOK HAS THEM, TOO. STORM REID IS GREAT. LOVE THE GENDER REVERSAL OF THE DOTING SIDEKICK. MADE ME CRY SEVERAL TIMES AND OVERALL A SWEET FAMILY MOVIE."
"939",0.5,"  Only good thing about this movie were the visual effects. All the rest was worst of worst"
"940",1,"  horrible movie....over act every angle and scene"
"941",0.5,"  Horrible. The only BRIGHt spots were the kid's performances. It was cringe worthy and lost sense of plot. They spent too much energy on makeup and costumes....which were ghastly. So disappointed."
"942",5,"  If you're familiar with the book you will love this movie. I really don't understand the negative reviews. It's a great movie"
"943",0.5,"  Disappointing and PoorlY made movie"
"944",0.5,"  God awful. I do not recomend."
"945",1.5,"  A really poor adaptation of the book, that also suffers from poor acting... I don't think the book is IMPOSSIBLE to make into a movie, but I feel like here they were not even trying to use the book as anything other than inspiration for a visually oriented movie where story was an afterthought."
"946",2.5,"  Grade: C+Rating: PG, 1 hour 49 minutesIn a Nutshell: Despite its best intentions, A Wrinkle in Time is disappointing as a film, although kids will probably still like it.Based on the very popular book A Wrinkle in Time (Time Quintet) by Madeleine L'Engle , it doesn't quite deliver the magic I hoped for, especially since screenwriter Jennifer Lee had done such great work with Disney's Frozen , Zootopia (DVD) Wreck-It Ralph and even Frozen Fever. Tips for Parents:LOTS of moral lessons kids and parents can feel good about.Kids in perilMrs. Whatsit uses the word ""prodigious.""

Become one with the universe and yourself.""The wound is the place where the light enters you."" - Mrs. WhoThings I liked:Chris Pine! I love him in anything.Storm Reid is adorable and did a pretty good job, although a bit straight-faced during most of the movie. Her best scene, by far, was with Chris Pine towards the end.It's a colorful ride. The gossiping flower scene was the best part of the film.Fun hairstyles on the Mrs.'s.Zach Galifinakus was pretty funny and did a lot with the very small role he was given.I think frequencies and energy are so interesting. If you're fascinated by science, check out A Wrinkle in Time Book of Fun, Facts, and Science Energy is everything.Some of the scenes were shot in gorgeous New Zealand.Things I didn't like:While director DuVernay was very enthusiastic and creative, her vision was probably overly ambitious, resulting in a choppy mess.A lot of the green screens look fake with some special effects that don't really work. Some weird moments with missing details. Sometimes I really wish directors would let me see their movies before they released them so that I could point out some of the mistakes that could be quickly fixed.Deric McCabe as Charles Wallace is super cute, but sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.I couldn't understand a word Storm Reid was saying during the tornado scene in the woods.Cliched scene where someone says, ""Do you trust me?""Mindy Kaling looked so awkward trying to run in her ridiculous dress. What was her character's purpose? She didn't actually do anything to help. Over-the-top make-up. The costumes were creative, but they looked like costumes.The ""Mrs's"" looked more fake than magical. You don't need to pay extra money to see this in IMAX. It's fine on the regular screen. Better yet, watch it when it comes out on Netflix.The dialogue may sound good in the book, but it's awkward in the movie.Lots of close-ups that don't really work.A scene in the second trailer was completely cut out of the movie.I actually looked at the clock on my cell phone. That's never a good sign.There's no real villain. There's only a wispy, menacing ""it."" Kids who haven't read the book might think that Oprah's character's name is Mrs. Witch. While Oprah really is bigger than life (I laughed when Mrs. Which was gigantic), her acting is not good. I heard her speak to a room full of 10,000 a number of years ago at the California Governor's Conference for Women and she was mesmerizing.Surprisingly, some of the acting was not good by quite a few of the other actors too. It felt forced and contrived.Interesting lines:""You can do this.

It's how we use them that counts."" - Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon)""Your house is so warm. You've done a good job keeping the darkness out."" - Mrs. Whatsit""Love is always there, even if you don't feel it. It's always there for you."" - Mr. Murry""Don't give up hope."" - Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)  @trinaboice"
"947",3,"  Too confusing, too preachy, too much focus on the Mrs. W's makeup and wardrobe and not enough attention to the basic story. I really wanted to like this. :("
"948",4.5,"  This movie was transporting. I suspect that most of the haters have either not recently read the book or never appreciated it in the first place. I re-read the book about two months ago and found it did not quite live up to how i had experienced it when i was a child. It was a book written for children and remains so. its themes are broad, but not well-developed. its language is utilitarian. it's still a very good story, but it's not the masterpiece i recall. the movie, on the other hand, was glorious in ways that i could not have imagined. Of course, it was different. that is necessary - and truly part of its beauty. A family living in a neighborhood in modern times with modern neighbors is more relatable than a remote house on the edge of the woods. Sure, I missed some of the details of the book (I really wanted to see Mrs. WhatsIt transform into the magical creature of the book, not so much a lettuce leaf--although the ""flying"" of the children was delightful--and I excepted a much more recognizable sky-skraping BUREAUCRACY in the central central intelligence), but there was so many inspired moments--the lure of the alternative self offered to meg during her battle, the purity of her love that saved charles wallace, the tender moments shared with meg and her father at the beginning, the wave to veronica at the end, and, i guess i am sucker for fashion, but the fantastic dresses of the mrses! i felt a much stronger emotional connection to the movie than i did upon my most recent read f the book, and i teared up through much of the movie (as did my husband and teenage daughter). for those critics who remain unmoved, i'm afraid the It has already taken hold."
"949",5,"  Absolutely loved it...not sure why all the haters"
"950",2,"  All over the place and rushed. Some Very boring SCenes and the last few minutes were a drag. INITIALLY, seeing Oprah and Mindy made we want to see it but Their roles were not developed at all. The visuals were okay at some POINTS BUT relied too heavily on that and not the plot. No comedic values and no character attachments. Wont be watching again and children will be bored out of their minds."
"951",0.5,"  Absolute trash. No regard for the source material combined with overbearing ""woke"" preachiness."
"952",5,"  GRanted ive never read the book, so my review may be mis-aligned with long time fans, but i thought the film was a moving experience, both visually and spirtually. I love folms that can succes deliver a message, and i feel like it did so."
"953",1,"  POORLY written, POORLY acted, SAVE YOUR time and MONEY. PERHAPS the single WORSE FILM i have ever HAD the displeasure OF SEEING."
"954",1.5,"  They changed so much It doesn't resemble anything from the book. A PC attempt that fails with serious character manipulation and under-development. I yawned most of the way through the awkward attempt at harnessing a classic. What a disappointment."
"955",0.5,"  MOST DISAPPOINTING FILM. most amazing book."
"956",1,"  I am not sure what I was expecting from this movie but needless to say at the end of the movie I was laughing because of how corny and cringey it was. Also, who the hell names their kid charles Wallace?"
"957",3.5,"  A wrinkle in tIme has likable characters,a great cast,stunning viduals and a meaningful story But the movie is oddly paced aNd is kinda stupid at times, overall its something kids can enjoy but adults probably wont"
"958",3.5,"  A Wrinkle in Time is visually stunning and brings about CHILDLIKE wonder. SUBTLE nuances to acceptance and inner strength provide a powerful message. The diversity portrayed on screen shows the world how it really looks. The young actors were incredible. It's not a perfect film, but it is a wonderful family FILM."
"959",2,"  i saw this last night. I found it choppy and boring. very disappointed."
"960",0.5,"  STOP it. Get some help."

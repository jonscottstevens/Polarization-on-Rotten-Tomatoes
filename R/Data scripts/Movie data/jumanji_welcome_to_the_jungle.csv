"1",3.5,"  Very entertaining sequel to the 1995 classic. Upgrading the board game to a video game turns out to be a good move and the concept of putting the real life characters into the bodies of their very different avatars brings along some good laughs. On top of that, all lead actors (with a special mention for Jack Black) bring their A-game, making this a fun, adventurous watch."
"2",3.5,"  The movie was pretty entertaining. Jack Black wasn't annoying for once and was actually hilarious. However I wouldn't really call this Jumanji.. It was hardly related to the original movie besides the board game at the start and the title of the movie. Other than that it's just a movie where they get sucked into a video game.... but still a good watch"
"3",4.5,"  Clever script with superb casting. It is hard to be quite as vested as in some other types of adventures because we ""know"" this is a game ... until we forget! Great fun."
"4",5,"  Way better than the 1st film."
"5",2.5,"  Loved the original so much that I thought this was a joke when I saw the preview, but ended up going to see it and it was much better than I thought it would be. Lots of laughs too."
"6",3,"  This movie was ok, but not as good as people were making it seem. I enjoyed it for the most part but don't really see myself taking the time to watch it again."
"7",3,"  ok not great The original was much better."
"8",4.5,"  The Rock plays very well with Kevin Hart. Laughs throughout the movie."
"9",4,"  Far better than I expected. If you enjoyed the Robin Williams original, and you are not totally annoyed by everything that Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson does, then give this a shot. If you have kids, this is one of those essential passing the torch moments. Highly recommend in Blu-ray too."
"10",3.5,"  If there is anything that the original ""Jumanji"" had that made it special, besides Robin Williams, is that the creatures were largely menacing and the mystery about how dangerous ""The Jungle"" of the game might be was a palpable thought. The fact that thar world doesn't feel vicious enough and they barely explore it is disappointing. BUT this updated follow-up is good fun on its own with a clever cast & solid entertainment! - 7/10"
"11",1.5,"  Welcome to the jungle...really? Is that the best they could come up with? How many movies have used that in one way or another now?So at the end of the first movie (in 1969) the board game Jumanji was thrown into a river by Alan Parrish; 26 years later (1995) its somehow ended up in France apparently. Fast forward to 1996 and the board game has once again been discovered...but back in America? (I trust that wasn't supposed to be the same beach from the first movie). Anyway the game has somehow evolved with the times and is now a videogame console; and once again it lures another unsuspecting youth into its jungle themed clutches. Fast forward again to 2016 and four students will also discover the board game which will trigger the same things that happened before. And round and round we go.So I gotta admit that I liked the idea that this mysterious game can somehow evolve with the times. Back in the first movie (1969) it was a board game to blend in with the era. Now its a videogame console which of course is perfect for this era. The whole idea of the protagonists choosing a game avatar to play as which then turns out to be their live action avatar once inside the game is pretty cool (although [i]Red Dwarf[/i] did it first). This does inevitably lead to very stereotypical characters which is deliberate...but doesn't excuse the stereotypical teenage protagonists which wasn't deliberate I'm guessing.Yeah so the teenagers, they're a straight 'Breakfast Club' type bunch for sure. You've got the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the weirdo. So yeah its a complete rip-off. I really felt like they could of done better with these characters despite the movie being full of deliberate cliches and stereotypes. As for the avatars they are also rather cliche, naturally. The Rock is of course just playing the same character he always does, basically himself. Jack Black is the squat, spectacled, old fashioned looking professor type. Kevin Hart is the goofy sidekick type. And Karen Gillian is Lara Croft essentially.One thing that did get me thinking was the in-game characters, the baddies and the in-game guide. The in-game guide and various baddie henchmen all seemed to act like actual videogame characters on rails. In other words they don't interact with the protagonists on a personal level, they just do and say what they were programmed. But some henchmen and the main villain (Bobby Cannavale as Professor Van Pelt, same name as the big game hunter from the first movie) seemed to not do this. It did seem like Van Pelt behaved differently and not in a programmed way like the others, almost as if he were a real person. Now in the original movie we never saw the jungle in the game, obviously this time we do. Alas its not really been visualised that well in my opinion. I always had the impression the jungle was set in an old fashioned British colonial type era mixed with a bit of [i]Tarzan[/i] type fantasy. Like the exterior of the board game indicates. Of course as the game evolved so did the interior jungle it seems. This unfortunately has led to all sorts of modern crap turning up like military choppers, motorbikes, modern guns and weapons, ridiculous chase sequences, and lots of explosions. Now I'm sure some people will have liked these elements but for me it totally ruined the entire feel of the movie, or at least the look and feel I was hoping for.Gone is the possibility of quaintness and charm, enter vast CGI chase sequences on-board a military chopper (being chased by man eating CGI rhinos. Why didn't they just shoot them?). Stupid chase sequences with hordes of motorbike riding bad guys. Lots of gunfire, explosions and of course the obligatory martial arts sequences from Ruby Roundhouse. I might add that Ruby Roundhouse spends lots of time trying to learn how to flirt and act sexy to distract some bad guys, but ends up just kicking the crap out of them. Her entire character is utterly pointless, why did we need all that shit when she can just beat them up. Its like one sequence where The Rock's character says he knows CPR but doesn't actually do it when its required. He just stands there and gives instructions to another character, eh??Its really such a shame that this movie went down the route it did. Obviously there was gonna be CGI involved, obviously there was gonna be greenscreen involved, but Jesus Christ could they not do any better than this?! Most of the CGI is bad, real bad. Most of the greenscreen is obvious, real obvious. In fact it gets noticeably worse towards the end in my opinion. There are barely any practical effects which the first movie did incorporate in places. This movie is just ugly from top to bottom and its not helped by all the ludicrous action sequences. Its like half the movie wants to be like [i]The Phantom[/i], and the other half like [i]Rambo[/i]. Its such a clash of genres and tone.There is also a large plot hole in the way this story works, I think, unless I missed something. In the original Alan Parrish goes back to the point where he started playing the game in 1969 and changes time. This is obviously meant that Judith and Peter would never have played (in 1995) and wouldn't know anything about the game or Alan (having never met him). In this new movie the protagonists meet up with the kid (Alex) who got trapped in the game from 1996. When they all leave Alex goes back to the point he started playing in 1996 and changes time. So if he changed time, how come the four main protagonists still remember everything when they get back to their present day of 2016? Surely there's a chance they would never have ended up playing the game, or the game wouldn't have ended up in the school (?).Anyway once again I find myself completely mystified by a modern movies success. How on earth did this pile of crap make so much money? How on earth did people find this enjoyable?? I could maybe understand it if this was an original movie and the first had never existed, but it does exist! I simply cannot fathom how anyone can accept this utter garbage after the excellent original movie (complete with a terrific Robin Williams) which came out back in 1995. There are some neat little touches here and there, I like the evolution and mystery of the game, and Jack Black is always a pleasure. But apart from that, this was yet another cookie cutter Dwayne Johnson flick. CGI laden trash of the highest order."
"12",3.5,"  movie was a lot better then expected. I saw the first jumanji movie when I was little and when I first heard about this and what the story was I thought It was going to ruin the jumanji name but after seeing it I am very much mistaken. I'm am still unsure about the board just randomly turning into a console game but still great story and funny. And I'm happy that they fitted in a robin Williams reference in the film."
"13",0.5,"  worst acting job I've ever seen in my life are people going to hell there's so much homosexuality in there how did you guys make this right for a kids watch nowadays guys are all fucked up in the head hands down gayest movie I've ever seen"
"14",1.5,"  This is one of the worst widescreen releases that I have ever seen. Thank the heavens that I didn't pay for it! The new JUMANJI has everything imaginable wrong with it. The environment has zero plausibility, there is no innovative creativeness, the characters are inane, and nearly all attempts to be funny are shamefully cartoonish. Practically no effort is put into generating special-effects that are warranted for blockbuster fantasy adventure and any concept (or quote) that had the slightest bit of humor to it, was widely broadcasted over the inordinate trailer. For the record, when I was fifteen years old, I absolutely loved the original JUMANJI. It's a disgrace that Hollywood was able to flourish a financial gain from this jejune slab of rubbish."
"15",3.5,"  Often entertaining, delightful and feels like a perfect adventure game."
"16",3,"  Just okay. Didn't quite live up to my expectations."
"17",4,"  This movie was great, but they shouldn't have destroyed the game."
"18",5,"  this is the best movie!!!!"
"19",5,"  love this movie so much"
"20",5,"  SOOOOO much better than the first one!"
"21",3.5,"  A fun movie that falls just short of the original. Good movie, kinda predictable."
"22",3,"  Overrated to a point. Still this ""Jumanji"" rehash still offers just enough fun and silliness without much boredom to give it a minor pass. I would beware of those who think this movie is close to the second coming, however."
"23",3.5,"  I watched it intending to waste time but I actually really enjoyed this sequel! It's nostalgic yet modern and still all very exciting! Fun!"
"24",5,"  A great movie, with a new and improved story and concept (although I think they took a big risk moving away from the original story, like in the first Jumanji movie). Entire cast was great, also, especially with the addition/appearance of K. Gillan, who I've personally never seen before."
"25",5,"  iT's so good to watch an anti sjw movie, this movie is a slap in the face to feminists."
"26",4,"  I had my doubts at first, but Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle caught me by surprise in how good it turned out. Solid cast, smart writing,clever callbacks to the first film, overall good popcorn fun. My only gripe is the ending."
"27",3.5,"  Did it need a sequel? No, but it's not half bad."
"28",2.5,"  It would be 1 star if not for Rock, Hart and Black. Incredibly stupid scenario even for the standards of children movies. I am extremely disappointed with my childhood movie remake"
"29",5,"  Good plot... Stayed interested the whole time... And it was hilarious!"
"30",4,"  Outrageously silly, but fully aware it is so."
"31",4,"  Really silly, really fun, exactly what you'd expect a movie like this to deliver, a really great update for once with the videogame-style integration, which if you are an action or RPG gamer you would really enjoy as it's very well done."
"32",2.5,"  While Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle manages to have its own shine and fun moments without exploiting the innevitable nostalgia factor that comes with it, it is also highly forgettable."
"33",0.5,"  Just wasn't good. No coherent plot. Couldn't follow. Not worth watching."
"34",4.5,"  No, this was not high art - but I loved everything about it. Perfect cast. A ton of fun. At this point I am pretty sure I will watch anything with the Rock in it."
"35",4.5,"  This movie is so hilarious and cool. Too much comedy and not too much action focus until the end. I wanted more of adventure movie than a comedy, but still good."
"36",4.5,"  Delightful movie, laughed all the way thru this movie."
"37",2,"  This sequel is a far cry from the original. It's more a comedy flick mixed with teenage drama than an adventure film."
"38",3,"  Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black make this an adventure worth taking."
"39",4,"  This movie had me actually laugh multiple times."
"40",5,"  A wonderful movie with great throwbacks to the original as well as amazing action/comedy. My whole family loved it."
"41",3,"  It should be funnier. It is a bit funny. It is fun to watch. But it just seems to line up there with many other so called ""comedies"" these days."
"42",4,"  Hesitated to watch this movie... but I am glad I did. Very funny and had a great story."
"43",4,"  Very funny and entertaining!"
"44",5,"  looks good but probably amazing"
"45",3,"  Set twenty years after Alan Parrish's fateful encounter with the dangerous board game Jumanji, the game has since then evolved into a plug and play video game designed to ensnare new players into playing new games. When four teenagers end up sucked into this new game and transformed into their avatars, they must use their new skills and abilities to win the game and escape Alan's world...Originally planned as a straight-up reboot of the 1994 Robin Williams cult classic, Jumanji, but ended up being retooled as a loose sequel after the tragic passing of Williams in 2014, this more comedic take on Chris Van Allsberg's story of a game coming to life may not always land in it's comedy, but the screenplay's clever knowledge revolving around video game tropes ironically makes this unwanted sequel, a more faithful adaptation, than 3/4% of most video-game film adaptations in the entire industry.Another aspect that makes this film extremely funny is the comedy revolving around the teenagers having to adapt to thier avatar bodies with the biggest laughs coming from a valley girl being reincarnated as a Jack Black Professor or the school sports star being turning into a wimpy Backpack-carrying Kevin Hart. Although these character arcs pale in comparison to Alan's arc in the first film, the actors all have such funny chemistry, that it's hard to compare them to the more serious character arcs of the first film.Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle may lack the intensity, surprises and character development of the 1994 film, but the funnier than expected humour, the impressive use of the video game setting within the screenplay and the solid acting, makes this stand-alone sequel, a game worth replay value..."
"46",4,"  I found this remake to be very refreshing and very entertainingly funny!"
"47",2.5,"  Sorry did not meet my expectations,w/ the star cast they great actors just not a blockbuser at no means!"
"48",3.5,"  Don't normally like these kind of movies, but this was fun."
"49",5,"  Wife and I loved it. They honored the original. Casting was perfect. One of the best films this year."
"50",4,"  It pays homage to the original without trying to recreate it. The only thing I want to know is: how does Jack Black play such a convincing teenage girl?"
"51",0.5,"  This was a pathetic movie that lacked imagination. It was ridiculous, childish, and lacking in entertainment. I think a lot of people like it because their kids like it."
"52",4,"  allot of funny moments but a few area's in the film could have been done better."
"53",5,"  loved it. funny, fast paced and just plain fun. I got exactly what I expected when I sat down to watch it. I wish there was a sequel with the same cast, they were great."
"54",4,"  I did not expect it to be THIS good. Kevin Hart is hilarious, and Jack Black obviously had tons of fun with his role. Pays beautiful homage to the first one but can totally stand alone as just a great film."
"55",3,"  It was very entertaining for what it was. I just wished that they had included more from the original movies like lion, huge mosquitoes, and people eating plants. Nothing in the jumanji jungle is unique but it's still a fun story"
"56",4,"  Fun and adventurous. While it certainly is not the original, this movie brings the board game to a new generation and did so successfully in my humble opinion."
"57",3.5,"  Don't go back and watch the original."
"58",4,"  Remaking a movie that wasn't good the first time. Then coming out on top. That's the secret Hollywood, I'm 13 and can figure it out. Whats your excuse?"
"59",4,"  Jumanji released in 1995 with the late great Robin Williams in the lead role, as a kid i considered this one of the greatest movies that was around and having watched it only recently before i went to check the new version out, i can still say hand on heart that it still ranks as one of the best, most imaginative movies I have seen. So when I heard they where releasing a remake I immediately thought how the hell will they inject new life into what is an already well established movie.Thankfully Welcome to the Jungle manages for the most part to maintain the quirky humour and fun which we had in the previous version while also keeping it fresh for a whole new generation. This is done by setting the movie in the modern day, the film opens with what i thought was a great twist where the dangerous Jumanji board game transforms into a video game so the more ""tech-reliant"" kids and adults of today may be more tempted to play. This proves to be successful when a group of unfortunate teenagers get sucked into the game one day while serving detention together.We see our characters take on the forms of avatars that they picked when playing the game, which results in each character being played by two different actors. The film has a lot of fun subverting the usual personas of each actor, whether its Dwayne Johnson's take on a nerdy uncomfortable high school dork to Jack Black's excellent portrayal of a superficial pretty popular girl.Most of the films comedy comes from those kind of contradictions, while jokes themselves come across quite cheap, like Jack Black constantly asking for his cell phone. The power of the actors helps to make a majority of them acceptable, this being most noticeable when the Rock and Kevin Hart share a scene, with the two of them having worked together before they garner some of the biggest laughs as their high school rivalry bleeds over into Jumanji's video game world usually in physical comedic ways.Jumanji plays well in the video game cliché as each character is given three lives with which they must try and work together to beat the game if they hoped to make it back to the real world, also they have riddled the game with what we would see in today's games from unresponsive NPC's to specific character strengths and weaknesses, even though at times it feels that the film is using that self-awareness to try and compensate for its less interesting twists and its less talented group of supporting characters.Unfortunately Jumanji does move away from the funnier lighter moments to focus on the slow developing relationships between all the main characters most of which comes across quite bland. For instance the romance between Spencer and Martha is just clichÃ©d and feels uncomfortable when it's being played by the Rock and Gillian as the avatars. This along with the boring and unintimidating video game villain keep this from being a must see in my opinion.But for those hoping that this was going to be the absolutely ridiculous over the top comedy adventure that we had seen through the trailers you can rest easy knowing that you will be treated to that when you go to see Jumanji.DIAGNOSIS - INPATIENT CAREJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle does a great job of bringing audiences back to the classic we all know and love but with a great updated twist on the story. Even if some of the subplots and emotional connections don't really click, the action, fun and humour still make this worth your while going to seeAndy"
"60",4.5,"  Jumanji is a solid 8/10 watch. Jack Black is great and Dwayne Johnson The Rock continues to be the most charismatic man ever."
"61",4.5,"  Jumanji is a solid 8/10 watch. Jack Black is great and Dwayne Johnson The Rock continues to be the most charismatic man ever."
"62",3.5,"  I've learned to avoid movies with The Rock in them, but this movie was actually enjoyable. Just a solid family-friendly adventure movie; nothing more, nothing less."
"63",5,"  excellent fun, far better than the 1st film, you definitely should make the time to watch it."
"64",4.5,"  JUMANJI was a hit across all ages. Very charming fun movie. Cast is amazing."
"65",2,"  Did not like it at all. First 20 minutes was okay, then all downhill after that. First my 12 year old got bored & left. Then I just didn't find it keeping my interest. Some movies should never get sequels."
"66",1,"  What's his name is big and the girl is very good looking. That is it."
"67",3,"  It was good but not great, and it couldn't have been more predictable. Its humour was mostly a miss or just kinda-funny, the actors couldn't get their character's right, and we learned nothing new about how game came to be or it's purpose. Still, it was mostly a cute movie, with its heartfelt moments."
"68",3.5,"  Good family movie. Exceeded my expectations and provided some genuine laughs. It is exactly what you would expect and a little more."
"69",0.5,"  Wow,why was the penis talk necessary in movie geared for children. This movie is a insult to the original. What a ripoff job to the public. I think they are riding the coat tail and making millions of dollars on us people who except these junk movies and give away our money. Unfortunately it's to late after we spend it with them it and I believe that's what they know. If you have young children and don't want them to see grown men peeing and talking about how it feels and asking for other men to help them you might not want to watch it with them.Most of the movie is all talking very little action"
"70",4,"  A lot of fun even for adults. Johnson, Hart, & Black are hilarious."
"71",4.5,"  Very funny, and much better than the original Jumanji."
"72",3,"  Not half bad, and defiantly amusing. on top, they linked the 1st one in a way which I was happy about."
"73",3,"  Good comedic acting saves this movie from the bad CGI, confusing rules about the ""game world,"" and overall shallow plot."
"74",2,"  So many things wrong with this movie, nothing like the original."
"75",3,"  This took me back to my childhood during the 90s. It's not the most serious movie, but it was a very enjoyable experience with genuine moments of laughter."
"76",4,"  Better than I expected. Worth seeing"
"77",3.5,"  it was ok, but was desparate for jokes."
"78",5,"  The Rock and Kevin James back together"
"79",4,"  Knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything it isn't. This movie is funny, action-packed, and you can tell everyone had a ton of fun making it."
"80",5,"  Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle was a very light hearted fun movie to watch. I loved the stereotypes and thought it made the movie very fun. Jack Black as a high school girl and Kevin Heart really made this movie extremely fun to watch."
"81",3.5,"  New spin on a classic movie. It's a hilarious, original, and fun movie."
"82",5,"  This is by no means a perfect movie, BUT I was surprised to find it very entertaining and visually exciting. I gave it a perfect score because thatâ??s what a movie is supposed to do- entertain!"
"83",4,"  I liked this way more than I thought I would. Jack Black playing a teenaged girl was hilarious! Good movie for all ages."
"84",4.5,"  Pretty good movie all around, a nice fresh take and subtle references to the original.Definately bettere than what I thought it was going to be."
"85",4.5,"  I loved this movie. Very funny too. The cast was great."
"86",4,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle embraces its whacky video game setting and charismatic cast the fullest, providing a fun-filled and amusing adventure that everyone can enjoy."
"87",4,"  Lots of fun! Hope there are more movies to come"
"88",3,"  A fun movie. Anytime the Rock and Kevin Hart are in the same movie it's probably pretty good. Still, I doubt there will be a sequel to this reboot. Spoilers - So when the pilot got back, well, that was a little confusing, but it was worth seeing."
"89",5,"  Jumanji sequel beats the original by a lot"
"90",2.5,"  Ok movie. Kinda stupid but some funny parts."
"91",1,"  Good movie for adults. HOWEVER, there are the implications of drinking and being drunk, cursing, and overly sexual dress all by teenagers. Maaaaaybe okay for teenagers, on the liberal side. NOT OKAY for small or young children. WTF did they do to this 90s classic?!"
"92",5,"  It was great fun! Haven't laughed that hard in a movie since I was a kid."
"93",5,"  A fun movie with greatly paced action and comedy."
"94",3.5,"  Entertaining and pretty funny. Especially Jack Black."
"95",4,"  I REALLY was surprised how much fun this film was, and it acully made me laugh! WAy better then the 1st! ""B""+, 88%!"
"96",4,"  The movie was great, It's not a reboot like most people thought it is an actual sequel to Jumanji.Just an all around great movie."
"97",3.5,"  I am pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie. The updated yet old-school video game was cleverly redone but still mimicked the original movie. The characters are Wonderful and Jack Black steals the show. I laughed out loud many times. It is fun to watch with older children. I would not recommend it for younger kids as it does have several curse words and they won't understand it. This movie is fun and I would watch it again."
"98",5,"  This definitely topped the original movie by a long shot and, if possible, I would love to see a third one!"
"99",0.5,"  The original movie was so great, and so impossible to top. I don't understand why anyone would want to make a ""sequel"" to something so spectacular!"
"100",4.5,"  Amazing act by the cast. Amazing Reboot of a long gone franchise. Hope to see more of it. Good Screenplay and Mesmerising Edits, costumes and locations"
"101",4,"  Jack Black is hilarious! I thought ""The Rock"" would have seen more action. All in all , I still favour the 1st Jumanji ."
"102",1,"  The acting is terrible."
"103",4,"  Far better than it had any right to be!"
"104",5,"  The kids and I watched it tonight and loved it!"
"105",5,"  Much as I loved Robin Williams version of Jumanji....this one is much better."
"106",3.5,"  Silly, stupid, but surprisingly fun."
"107",2.5,"  When I first heard of this movie, I honestly figured it would be disgustingly bad. Now that it's out, I can see that it's nowhere near as bad as I expected. Still, that doesn't mean I necessarily like it.Jumanji is part of the new trend of disguising remakes as sequels. That, or it's a sequel disguised as a remake. Either way, it stands out from the original Jumanji in some ways and is strikingly similar I other ways. The characters, meanwhile, are more high school and action movie archetypes than characters. That makes it hard to get invested in them or take them seriously, until they get some perfunctory but welcome character development. Then again, taking them seriously isn't really the point. It's supposed to be a mindless fun. At first, I thought all of the camera movements would get in the way of that, but the cinematography hits that sweet spot of showing off the craziness without being nauseous. During the climax, the lighting similarly sets the mood without being so dark that you can't see what's going on.Jumanji's main appeal is seeing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart at work together. Co-staring in last year's Central Intelligence has given the pair good experience to build their chemistry off of. Still, that's not enough to refresh this movie's stale sense of humor. Most of the jokes are based on cliches, dumb, or telegraphed miles in advance. There are quite a few laughs to be had here, but there's no getting around how unfunny large chunks of the movie is, Since that's the core of the movie. Adventure-comedies are perfectly fine, but there are countless movies out there that do it better."
"108",3,"  i thought this was pretty funny movie"
"109",2,"  Not too bad,if you?ve nothing else to watch :)"
"110",4,"  this was funny; Kevin Hart's character is quite comical. his snarky comments got me good a few times. & Jack Black does such a great job at being stupid, too. i really liked it. i'd definitely watch it again."
"111",4.5,"  This made me laugh and scream at the action parts. This reboot might not top the original but is a funny and action packed experience for all ages"
"112",4.5,"  i was so surprised at how good this movie was. very enjoyable the whole way through Rock and Hart solid and funny as usual."
"113",4.5,"  The movie ""Jumanji, welcome to the jungle"" is a 2017 american action comedy film. From a story by Chris McKenna, it's the second movie in the jumanji franchise based on the 1981 children's book. The film starts Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Set twenty-one years after the first film, the plot follows four teenagers who are transported into a video game world called ""Jumanji."" Once the player chooses their character for the game they all get sucked in. Uniting with another they must overcome the games magical power in order to win and return home. In the end, the cast saves the day and wins the game of Jumanji and returns home. The moral of the movie is a band of friends come together by putting aside any differences they have and overcoming the challenges of Jumanji. The new movie had some concerns and seems to some people to be disrespectful because of the original movie starring Robin Williams. People think that due to Robin Williams legacy it's cruel to try to ""remake"" or ""modernize"" the original jumanji movie but the author thought differently, the author made the movie on the amazing and fun idea of the jumanji movie but also in remembrance of Robin Williams. This paper will show specific analysis of the movie that it was not disrespect towards Robin Williams, but rather honored him though character analysis and the specific ideas of the movie. The movie ""jumanji, Welcome To The Jungle"" honors Robin Williams because of the specific ideas of the movie. The first jumanji movie was based on a board game and is a very popular film because of Williams, but the new movie is based on a video game and some people have some speculations as to why. The new movie takes place in the jungle of jumanji and through the movie there were many incidences where they referenced Robin Williams from the original jumanji movie. For example, in the original jumanji movie Robin williams character in the movie (Alan Parrish) was stuck in the jungle just like the characters in the new movie, but while they're there, they find many clues left behind by Williams' Character who was stuck there from the original. This is important because the new Jumanji movie has not overthrown the original and the directors of the movie show that. Through the movie they don't directly reference Williams, but they leave mini easter eggs to show that this movie was not the original. This movie also honors Robin Williams because of the characters who play in the new movie. There are specific examples of the actors from the movie such as Kevin Hart, the Rock, Nick Jonas, and Karen Gillan who testify to reporters that when they were making this movie they did not forget to remember robin williams and the original movie. For example, Kevin hart said that ""We didn't want to do a remake, we're doing more of a continuation and we just wanted to make sure that we do that film proud."" It's almost like the karate kid franchise, there were multiple movies, but when they made the 2010 film there were no arguments made to as if the movie was cruel to the original. This is important because the directors of the movie jumanji weren't just trying to profit from the original but they were trying to step in the light of Robin williams. This film also steps into the light of Robin Williams by giving people something to remember him by through easter eggs in the film. The directors of the movie didn't forget to leave out a small roll that Robin Williams plays even in the new movie. For example, in the film when the four characters are trapped in the jungle of jumanji when jack black and Dwayne Johnson's characters find a jungle house that only could have been built by Robin Williams character, parrish, who was stuck in the jungle for 23 years in the first film. Jack Black also goes on to say that ""We're exploring the jungle and trying to conquer the game; it's life or death. But while were there, we find clues left behind by (Robin Williams's Parrish character). He built a full-blown jungle house, similar to a Swiss Family Robinson situation. It's like he's there helping us without actually being there."" This is important because most people who are against this film go on to say that this movie is almost against Robin Williams because they believed that they were trying to overthrow his legacy when that's the complete opposite of what the directors purposes were. Kenny, a writer from new york times, has a negative remarks for ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"".. For example, ""very few remakes, sequels or franchise reboots have signaled their desperation to connect quite as nakedly as Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle does."" In other words they're trying to cash in on the success of the original jumanji movie from 1995, but threw the evidence of this paper it goes to show that not some, but all the actors and the directors of this film made this movie all under the influence of Robin Williams. For example, dwayne johnson, behind scene says, ""I have such a tremendous amount of love and reverence for the original movie and what Robin meant to my family. I loved it like the world loved it."" In the end, the jumanji movie isn't disrespectful towards Robin Williams because the characters and the specific ideas of the movie prove that wrong. Robin Williams legacy lives on threw quotes, specific examples in the movie, and people. The purpose of this film is only trying to do the original movie proud."
"114",2,"  ok movie, don't know why one of the jonas was in this movie. they're suppose to be musicians not actors. the movie was boring at times, but it was entertaining none the less."
"115",5,"  I am going to talk about this film. I went to see the film in the cinema 1 month ago. I really like it.It's about 4 people who played a video game called Jumanji. They went into the video game and played it. The game is about life or death. They have many crazy adventures and they were very scared.I love it because the people are very funny and fun. They've got superpowers, for example: one of the people can run very quickly. They've got 3 lives and when they lose it they die. Everyone got weak points.Please see it! It's fantastic!"
"116",4.5,"  With a very endearing cast and humorous storyline, Jumanji has done it again giving fans of the previous movie a satisfied sequel and the new generation a very entertaining family movie. The only thing I wish to criticize is the extremely underdeveloped and un-threatening villain."
"117",4,"  I loved this movie. What could be better than Jack Black portraying a teenage girl? It is entertaining, funny and worth seeing."
"118",3,"  not bad for what its worth. The Rock Rules as always"
"119",4,"  I loved this movie! Anything with the Rock and Kevin Hart is bound to be a hit, but honestly worth seeing again!"
"120",3,"  5 Points: 1) Cast - 1.0/1.0 2) Storyline/Plot: 0.5/1.03) Soundtrack - 0.5/1.04) Visuals - 0.5/1.0 5) Distinguishing Aspects - 0.5/1.0 Total: 3.0/5.0 Suggested RT Score: 77%"
"121",1.5,"  89% of audience enjoyed this??? Really? I must be out of touch with reality or the demographics of the audience have changed. I used to prioritize my viewing based on RT scores and other indicators, but this is yet another example of why I need to change my watching philosophy. The original Jumanji was fun, entertaining, etc. I could not help but think that this movie was primarily targeted for the teen-age crowd with little to entertain anyone over the mental age of 17. I like the actors individually and there were a couple (and only a couple) good lines (mostly delivered by Kevin Hart who was obviously the comic relief character). But the entire premise, execution, and plot was flat and did nothing to pique my interest. It is true that most sequels are poor attempts to capitalize of the popularity of the original, and this lives up to that. My advise: If you are over the mental age of 17, don't bother unless you don't mind plopping down $6 on cable and wasting almost two hours of your life. I'm sorry for the review, but I wish Hollywood (or Japan or China or whoever has bought the movie studios most recently) would focus more on plot, character development, and WRITING over cheap gags and special effects."
"122",3.5,"  3/21/2018The movie took on a whole different narrative from the 90's original but added some clever gaming factors. Overall, not all that original but fun nevertheless."
"123",4,"  A great movie that embraces the video game aspect. Although some parts are slow and characters slightly have a bad moment or two, these characters really elevate this movie. The only character I think fell flat was Kevin Hart as he was himself. Everyone else played a highschooler which can be felt but Hart felt like the same old Hart. I love Hart but he brings it down slightly and he should have been a bit more ruder. I love the Rock and Jack Black were the best in my opinion, especially Black since he was the funniest and more true to his high school counterpart. Great Movie and the critic review has underestimated this movie."
"124",3,"  It is not hilarious, but there are some good laughs in this movie. It doesn't take itself seriously, it's just a fun adventure with a great cast. I recommend it."
"125",4,"  It's almost like Breakfast Club and Jumanji had a love child. You've got all the elements, the nerd, the jock, the self-absorbed girl and the socially inept girl. But the simple truth is - Jack Black as a self-absorbed teenage girl was BRILLIANT. He was hysterical."
"126",3,"  Far more amusing than it has any right to be. Unlike the original, there is more of a sense of imagination on display even if it is ultimately just a goofy action comedy."
"127",4.5,"  Jumanji was a really good film. 8/10"
"128",2.5,"  While the cast, performances and action scenes are passable by modern standards, its let down by its juvenile sense of humour. However, credits where credits is due, the teenagers do feel like real, modern teenagers of the current generation, in contrast with most other teens of this generation. Overall, it feels pandering, so i recommend you skip it"
"129",3.5,"  Jack Black stole the show"
"130",5,"  A surprisingly good sequel from the Robin Williams classic fantasy movie.on can tell that the cast is having fun..."
"131",4.5,"  This was a freaking funny movie. Had me cracking up the whole time."
"132",1,"  Tried to watch it I ejected it when it said it had demon possession. As my household is Christian."
"133",5,"  HILARIOUS movie, I love it! Great movie on many levels. a lot of fun. Awesome film, very hilarious.Great movie for all ages."
"134",2,"  Not a big fan of this film. Here's why:1) Making 'Jumanji' an Atari game was STUPID. Really? The jungle drums wouldn't have enticed 1996 Kid to play the game? It was an 'update' that didn't need to happen and it took away some of the magic of the original film. TOTALLY unnecessary and dopey change that will date the film. Kind of like in ""Hook"" when the lost boys start doing the ""Arsenio Hall"" whoop whoop whoop chant. 2) The original Jumanji was about the real dangers of the jungle of the past (animals, floods, hunters, etc.). This one tried to make things up to date by having humans with motorcycles being the villains. Again, nothing like the original story. I do realize that the film doesn't need to tell the same story again, but the original film had a lot of charm that had to do with it not being set in modern times.3) Language- First, I really don't care if swearing is in a movie. HOWEVER- this movie was clearly aimed at kids. The dopiness of the situation, the game aspect, etc. Why have all the language in there?4) Actors- Kevin Hart can be funny. Jack Black can be funny. But here, the lines were so dumb and it was like the writers said ""Okay, let's roll out the typical Hart/Black schtick - even though real characters wouldn't say this stuff"".Overall, I felt this was put together without a lot of respect for the original and it just comes off as a money grab rather than ""a good story that needed to be told"". I thought Johnson and Gillan were fine in it, for what it was. They did a good job with what they had. Making Jack Black's character a female was dopey and unfunny and felt completely forced. Same with Hart's character. He's always gonna be Kevin Hart.Oh, and I was disappointed that with Rhys Darby in a film, there was no band meeting (Flight of the Conchords reference). ;)"
"135",3.5,"  Hilarious! I laughed out loud several times. It was a little draggy through the middle, but generally action packed. I would watch it again."
"136",3,"  Really enjoyed this. Had some funny lines but had more cheesy moments."
"137",1,"  Terrible, nowhere in the same league as the original. Baddies in the jungle on motorbikes wtf?"
"138",3.5,"  Actually a pretty funny and clever movie. Jack Black is the standout but they all have their chances to shine."
"139",5,"  great movie its funny,charming,and fun"
"140",5,"  Best freakin movie! Hilarious, suspenseful and heartfelt!"
"141",3.5,"  Such a fun movie, a must see in the theater if you can"
"142",4.5,"  It was a blast to watch. Easily the most fun I've had at the theaters in 2017."
"143",4.5,"  The movie was fantastic, & I can't wait to buy it on blu-ray"
"144",5,"  Pure Popcorn Gold! a no-nonsense fun action movie with great comedy, great pacing that leaves you throughly satisfied."
"145",1,"  so bad....so very bad....."
"146",4.5,"  Dont know if its an original element because I havn't seen the original movie and I cant remember the tv show but the comedy element to this whole movie is that the four stars in JumanJi 1.The Rock 2.Kev Hart 3.Jack Black 4.Karen Gillan are actually just avators of the 4 school children that entered the game this surprised me but it worked really well. I watched this movie last night and I want to see it again highly recommend. It would be nice to see a sequel even if it meant different actors."
"147",4.5,"  Great movie. I initially wasn't expecting too much but boy was I wrong. it was super entertaining and funny. All around a fun movie. I would recommend this to everyone."
"148",4.5,"  So much fun! Not perfect, but it's definitely one of the most enjoyable movies of 2017 for me!"
"149",4.5,"  great movie, great cast, didn't like the first part......it made little sense, or the ending for the same reason, but the middle was awesome fun and funny."
"150",5,"  Loved it! Hilarious!"
"151",3,"  Solid fantasy/action flick. Kevin Hart is actually tolerable in this movie"
"152",5,"  Surprisingly great movie!?"
"153",4,"  Even after having seen the trailers, there was still plenty of funny in there. The kids & I really enjoyed it."
"154",5,"  Jumanji - welcome to the jungle, it's a very good movie! Full of adventures and laughter. It brings a lot of creativity and fantasy to the movies.It is about four young people who enter a game and have the mission to pass the stages and win the game to save Jumanji and their lives.This film has a glamorous cast, and a beautiful production. One of the actors who had a brilliant highlight was Nick Jonas, who played Alex, the boy who disappeared and got stuck in the game for twenty years, but who is rescued by his friends afterwards.Jumanji - welcome to the jungle, was a continuation / remake of Jumanji, released in 1995. Many fans of the old movie did not expect good things about the new Jumanji, but fortunately the movie was a success. Jennyffer Ribeiro 2ano B"
"155",4,"  Quite pleasantly surprised by this movie"
"156",3.5,"  It was funny. A bit cheesy at times and the serious moments could've been done better. Bit it's funny"
"157",3.5,"  It was funny. A bit cheesy at times and the serious moments could've been done better. Bit it's funny"
"158",3.5,"  enjoyable comedy like most featuring the rock and kevin hart. jack black is particularly hilariously as a teen girl stuck in an overweight middle aged body. worth a watch"
"159",5,"  Hilarious, great pacing, great story."
"160",3,"  The story line is a bit bland and the CGI is pretty poor. Jack Black is excellent, Kevin Hart is lousy. But with a movie starring the Rock, its gonna be a hit. For me its just pure entertainment fu."
"161",3,"  It was funny and cute."
"162",5,"  If they did not have Kevin Hart and Jack Black in this movie... Dear God it would have SUUUUCKED! Imagine if this movie had The Rock and then a bunch of nobodies. It would have been too awful to watch. Thankfully, Hart and Black made this movie great, watchable, and down right HILARIOUS! Overall, a very C-grade movie, similar to anything else The Rock does, like Journey to the Center of the Earth. But thankfully Hart and Black made this movie great!"
"163",3,"  a relatively balanced piece with humor, action and some good lessons, delivered in a more elegant way than we usually see in such movies."
"164",4.5,"  Loved it! Wasn't sure what to expect, but laughed throughout the entire movie. Definitely something to see and enjoy."
"165",4,"  Goofy as all get out but that's EXACTLY what makes it fun.. Yea it's a good watch"
"166",5,"  HILARIOUS movie, I love it! Beginning to end. loved all the characters, the VILLAIN could have been stronger but overall a well made movie with a great cast."
"167",4,"  An enjoyable time-killer film, had some moment of laughter.."
"168",5,"  Fantastic! Walked out of the theater with a smile on my face."
"169",2,"  The first half of the movie kind of works, but then it turns into a train wreck. It's unfortunate we'll have to endure a sequel to this."
"170",2,"  There was a lot of potential to do clever things with people thrown into a video game world populated by NPCs. The writers take advantage of none of it, and instead resort to a hackneyed replay of typical teen themes."
"171",4.5,"  Unexpected fun movie with the Rock and Kevin Hart!"
"172",2,"  Without Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson, this movie would've sucked."
"173",4,"  Classic popcorn fun - a very character driven movie in which you can see all the actors had lots of fun doing it. The 'teen' language is remarkably accurate of today's trends and the video game references are a nice bonus! Potentially the best video game movie ever?!"
"174",5,"  Great movie and funny"
"175",4,"  I found it a very funny movie! We've seen it on a friday night and i was very tired ?? so it was nice that you don't have to think too much. I laughed a lot because most of the time it was hilarious! It's a perfect family movie with a lot of humor!"
"176",4,"  Love how the actors and actresses show the different skills and personalities in the games. I laughed out loud from the beginning to the end."
"177",4,"  Jack Black was outstanding, Kevin Hart was hilarious, and movie actually had a great twist on a classic."
"178",5,"  Great movie on many levels.... a lot of fun."
"179",5,"  funniest movie I have seen in a long time"
"180",5,"  This was just a fun, fun watch. I am a diehard original Jumanji fan, so I had high expectations going in."
"181",4,"  It was a pretty good movie, but not as good as the original movie!"
"182",4,"  I didn't intend to see this film, but when it proved to have massive legs, I gave in, and I'm so glad I did. Incredibly enjoyable and has a very good-hearted message."
"183",5,"  Another Fun Movie, so fun, Go just to see Jack Black in his role"
"184",4,"  This movie is way better than it has any business being."
"185",5,"  Fun, funny and action packed, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly fun time that one may argue that is better than it's predecessor."
"186",4,"  I was entertained, which is exactly what I wanted."
"187",4,"  Fun movie, great cast, and hands down tops the original !"
"188",4,"  Consider this: Jack Black's character speaks in a high-pitched, effeminate voice throughout the movie-which prima facie might seem to be because he plays the virtual reality avatar of a teen girl, but once you realize that none of the other characters have the timbre of their voices altered, it means that the girly voice is natural to Black's character. That's a funny joke any way you slice it, and speaks to how cleverly layered this adaptation of Jumanji ultimately is."
"189",5,"  Awesome film, very hilarious."
"190",4,"  i laughed so hard when fridge exploded when he ate the cake, fell out of the helicopter, and saying he has a magic backpack, and at the end came out on the elephant yellin' ZOOLOGY B*TCH"
"191",4.5,"  This movie was a great sequel to Jumanji! I was skeptical at first, but my friend wanted to see it, so I went with him. I was surprised after seeing it. It's a fun film and a good sequel!"
"192",3.5,"  A rowdy romp through a jungle adventure that plays well with fun actors, fun writing, and a vibe that gives a nod to the original while feeling fresh and interesting."
"193",3,"  Not as good as the original."
"194",3.5,"  Jumanji is the 2nd pairing of Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and they don't disappoint. Then throw in Jack Black as a high School debutante and the good times roll."
"195",2,"  Unnecessary sequel that doesn't understand what made the source appealing, as soon as characters are put in the video game all suspense was lost because it was different characters and they just hamfisted their way through cultural statements. I'm very tired of movies being Ok reboots rather than taking any risk, this movie is set to make 400 million and that's the real tragedy, they're selling the same movie watered down and modernised to make a quick buck and we are so starved for good movies we get excited that they don't ruin it, how low a bar have we made. But hey Jack Black plays a good trans guy so let's give this shit 80%"
"196",5,"  Funny and smart twist"
"197",3.5,"  This movie gathers an amazing cast, a really funny script and makes it into something great and magical, a movie where you're going to have a good time, gauranteed. While it's a movie that nobody really asked for, but it's also a movie that you didn't now you needed, and on a side note, the CGI was outstanding, Jumanji really felt like a breathing place."
"198",5,"  That was way better than I thought it was gunna be! They did a good job!"
"199",2.5,"  One word: Overrated it dosen't deserve 76%. I would say it deserves a ""Ok"" or 50%"
"200",2.5,"  I was impressed by Black's performance. Decent action but it didn't equate to greatness."
"201",5,"  i loved it very funny and story is great almost as good as the old robin Williams version rip"
"202",4.5,"  The whole family enjoy this!! We're huge fans of the original and went in expecting this movie to disappoint. Pleasantly we loved it! The original is still better but this was fun the whole way through!! The cast did a great job portraying their teenage counterparts. Jack Black was probably the best at acting childlike but that is too be expected.Worth a watch for sure!!!"
"203",4,"  I like the stars that were cast and thought they actually worked well together. I also liked how they gave reference to the original movie. And the video game aspect was pretty cool."
"204",4,"  Jumanji is basically the original 1995 film mixed with 'The Breakfast Club' and although its characters are thus stereotypical, they are still very well developed, likable and the interactions between them are amusing. Karen Gillan and Jack Black stole the show here as the former is badass and the latter is hilarious. The film has excellent world building, great humor and such a fun story. It is the best video game movie since 'Wreck-It Ralph' and it's also the most purely entertaining film of the year."
"205",4,"  Great movie for all ages."
"206",3.5,"  This movie was fun. I especially enjoyed Jack Black's character throughout the movie. While not a cinematic masterpiece, it was worth seeing and I wouldn't mind seeing it again."
"207",5,"  Loved it !!! The Rock does it again with this star studded actors in a fun movie that was worth seeing on the big screen."
"208",4,"  Hilarious, smart, and undeniably fun. Finally, a comedy that taps into the potential of character stereotypes and outlandish story-telling that makes sense."
"209",4,"  When I first heard they were making a sequel to Jumanji, I was against it. However, upon seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised. This is an entertaining movie. It builds on the original movie, but it can stand on its own, and the film creates a new set of obstacles for the heroes to overcome. Plus, it features plenty of action and plenty of laughs. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a sequel done right."
"210",4.5,"  (85/100)Wow this was entertaining to watch!"
"211",3.5,"  as a fan of Dwayne's work I was looking forward to this movie, but I feel like i was a bit overhyped, i kept reading good things about it and literally read 0 bad things. So naturally i was a bit disappointed when i finally saw the movie. Never the less I do love the movie. A good movie to see with your family or friends (or both)."
"212",4.5,"  Funny, but it's hard to see how the boardgame connects with this videogame. COULD HAVE BEEN better but all together, it was pretty good."
"213",3,"  At first watch this movie was entertaining however afterward I realised the plot was very thin and I probably wouldn't watch it again. The acting by the young characters at the start and the end of the movie is really corny and I don't blame the actors themselves, I blame the material for that. This movie is based on humour and features video game tropes very prominently. At first watch I found the video game element of the movie to be good entertainment folly however after the movie ended I realised they only did this because the plot was so thin and they had no other ideas. The actors are all good in their roles and the movie is meduiumly funny all the way through. Again however there are drawbacks to this because the original Jumanji movie was scary, eerie, well written and was done on a grand scale. This movie doesnt do those ideals justice it was heavily reliant on humour and video game tropes. I also felt like there should have been more animals involved...considering they were in the jungle after all. Of the animlas that were featured they were clearly CGI and I felt it would have been more realistic to use real animals for the close up's at least. This movie did entertain me when I watched it however after the credits rolled I realised this was only on a superficial level and there was no depth to it."
"214",5,"  Never a dull moment. The film was throughly entertaining."
"215",3,"  Overhyped. This film is too kiddie and bland with not enough interesting material to go around for the length of its duration. The entire film runs out of steam way before its third act...and Dywane and Hart have been funnier in other pieces."
"216",4,"  the story is super simple and predictable, but the cast was great and the story is funny enough to get me engaged throughout the film."
"217",4.5,"  Was HESITANT because they changed it from a board game to a video game.. WOW i really loved this movie :) OOPS CAPS"
"218",5,"  surprisingly awesome."
"219",5,"  DiVERTIDO, EMPOLGANTE, BONITO E SIMPLISTA. o remake/continuaçÃ£o do clÃ¡ssico jumanji, Ã© um deleite aos olhos e ouvidos de quem assiste, Ã© um filme simples mas rico de qualidades, e uma das que mais chama a atenÃ§Ã£o Ã© a forma como o longa lida com os problemas da sociedade, um verdadeiro choque de realismo. jack black interpretando uma personagem feminina Ã© simplesmente icÃ´nico."
"220",4,"  i liked it and I didnt think I would. funny enough."
"221",4,"  so funny. Even the 6yo loved it. Great cast."
"222",1,"  Unfunny, and tries too hard to be. Everything about this sucks, 1 star is a gift."
"223",3,"  Silly, fun and UNCHALLENging. Updates the original but without pushing any BOUNDARIES. the slapstick comedy and witty quips are worthy of the odd chuckle. A nice bit of harmless family entertainment."
"224",4,"  A fun and entertaining movie. I did not go in with that many expectations, but left pleased."
"225",3,"  Decent movie but thought it would be a lot funnier. The quests are alright and the actors are good but just didnt seeem to hold my attention"
"226",5,"  well rounded cast that really made the film worth watch"
"227",4.5,"  i THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS HILARIOUS! wOULD SEE IT AGAIN!"
"228",5,"  loved the movie. Went in with no expectations and laughed a lot. Cast was perfect."
"229",2,"  Never judge a movie by its Box office draw.,, a proverb I should have remembered going into this. Thank god for Moviepass because this movie was a major DISAPPOINTMENT."
"230",4,"  Funny, engaging, great characters, action, a worthy successor to the original."
"231",5,"  I know it seems ambicious, but i aBsoluetly loved this movie. It was similar to the original, But still making it its own movie. Also, i was. Laughing about every 5 seconds so thats a autoMatic win for me"
"232",5,"  Loved it!!!! I hope they come out with another part"
"233",4.5,"  Jack black is perfect in this movie!! he is perfect in a supporting role, and the rock and kevin hart work together perfectly. Its almost a modern ""Road"" movie"
"234",5,"  HILARIOUS, FUND AND ENTERTAINING"
"235",5,"  HILARIOUS!!!! IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH GO AND WATCH IT. WHEN I SAW IT, IT MADE MY DAY. AMAZING ACTORS AND ACTRESSES."
"236",5,"  Very enjoyable movie with nonstop action (not counting The first ten minutes where the plot is being Set up). Clever script with lots of humor. This is a movie i could watch more than once! Would recommend seeing it on the big screen!"
"237",0.5,"  not funny and boring. i only laughed on the cake weakness part."
"238",4,"  Lacked the creep factor of the original but was great fun"
"239",5,"  Hilarious! My family and I laughed a lot. Jack Black was the highlight ??"
"240",3,"  Funny and entertaining - For the young at heart"
"241",5,"  I went in with low expectations, but this film really blew me away. My only gripe is that the promos so heavily featured the rock and kevin heart, when by far the funniest in the movie was jack black. He was the best high school girl character i have seen in a long while!"
"242",2,"  The effects have improved (as you'd hope they would over the course of 22 years), but Welcome to the Jungle didn't really do much for me. It completely lacks the charm of the original movie, but also the worldly scope of the animated series. I sat there patiently as weak joke after weak joke bounced off of me ineffectually, but the person I watched it with seemed to be having a great time, so maybe I'm just dead inside?"
"243",5,"  Great story....and fun to watch!"
"244",2.5,"  good movie, but compare it to the 1995 Jumanji i think they lost the sense of the originality of the 1995 version. I was expecting the whole real dimension would turn into a safari place instead of them being sent to the Jumanji. I guess I just love the mix between real dimension and the wildlife like the 1995 version of the movie. but, it's a worth to watch movie after all."
"245",4,"  Fun movie and buying it when it comes out in 4k Blu"
"246",5,"  ""Who's Alan Parrish?""""I don't know, he built it. WIthout it I Wouldn't Be here.""RIP Robin Williams"
"247",4,"  The oRIGINAL INTRODUCED A CONCEPT. SO THIS MOVIE TAKES IT EASY AND BRINGS IN THE HUMOR AND DIALOGUES. AMAZING CAST AS WELL."
"248",3.5,"  I quite liked it to be honest. I was already a fan of the original jumanji and this one had better humor. The acting also was fun except for 'rubys'."
"249",1,"  Total Disappointment. Why not take Jumanji off ? Totally irreverent to the original. Totally not like a game."
"250",3.5,"  what a wonderful surprise!I went into this, thinking this would be awful, but i found myself enjoying this film very much. i thought most of the jokes hit, the action was good, and i cared about the cast. This is a film that, both kids and adults can enjoy."
"251",5,"  Don't listen to the haters. This movie is great. My wife and I haven't laughed this much over a movie in a long time. Fun, entertaining movie and a++ cast."
"252",4,"  A wonderful homage to its original material while being fun and fantastic."
"253",3,"  I saw it because the trailer was so good. The movie... not so much. Did anyone else think it was racist? The black guy/zoologist actually calls himself a ""valet"" to the rock's character."
"254",4.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle is an entertaining and hilarious sequel that I went into with low expectations and came out extremely surprised. The cast was incredible, and all of their performances were very funny and fun to watch (Jack Black portraying a teenage girl was hilarious), and there was also a lot of character development for an action movie like this. The scenes in the jungle are also very beautiful and the special effects are wonderful at times. In the end, this sequel is very entertaining, ultra hilarious, and quite heartwarming albeit some scenes that were a little boring/unnesscary. - 90%"
"255",3.5,"  JUMANJI- 73%A VERY FUNNY WELL CAST PRODUCTION.JUMANJI HAS A NICE STRUCTURE AND A VERY WELL EXECUTED GAME-LIKE THEME. THE ACTORS WERE WELL CAST AND JACK BLACK WAS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. IT IS HARD TO MAKE ME LAUGH IN A MOVIE AND JUMANJI DEFINITELY DID IT. IT DID NOT FEEL TOO LONG DESPITE IT BEING AROUND 2 HOURS WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE. STORY WISE AND EXECUTION: 2.7/3.5ACTING: 1.8/2.5CAMERA WORK: 1.7/2SOUND: 1.1/2OVERALL SCORE: 3.65/5"
"256",0.5,"  The CGI is terrible. This movie should Have been 5 stars. Not the best remake for jumanji at all."
"257",4,"  It's a ton of fun. The whole cast looks like they're just kids (reminding us of Williams in the original). Jack black is EASILY the best with his take of a teenage girl and the rock is JUST so relaxed it's easy to relate. Still it does miss the suspense and charm of the original, as this is a direct sequel."
"258",5,"  The most fun I've had at the movies in a long time"
"259",3.5,"  The movie's first 24 minutes were too slow in introducing us the main cast of 4, but overall a fun and decent Christmas treat through great jokes, action sequences and energetic acting performances. I also love Karen Gillian's costume and make-up, she looks smoking hot in it."
"260",4,"  Had low expectations for this one, but turns out that is pretty nice, fun to watch."
"261",3.5,"  The first time I watched the trailer for this movie, I thought my self that this was going to ruin ""Jumanji's"" name. I decided to give the movie a chance and watched it on theaters. Ok, the film is not bad, it really makes you laugh in some scenes. Johnson, Black and Hart really saved the movie. I liked the story (in some parts) and the way they did the whole ""Jumanji"" concept. I do not agree on those un-real scenes where un-human situations happened to the characters, it is something i am not very fan of in movies like this (unless I am seeing those low budget films that you see on tv only). I mean, they had the production to make these scenes more believable. The end I'll give it a 2/5, I felt it very forced and I think that every people in the theater already knew how the movie will end. I give it a 3 1/2 stars rating, just because the film was more than I expected. I think that the cgi is a lot to fell in love of the film. If the movie would not had the ""Jumanji"" name, I think it would be an amazing and original movie with upcoming parts. At least now, I will not be to much of a fan to see a second or third part of it, only if they decide to do it the old school way."
"262",4.5,"  Jumani Welcome to the jungle is One of the best films to come out in 2017 and it was worth the wait. The cast does such a good job with the comedy and action in this movie. The Dwayne johnson and Kevin hart team up is so perfect just like in their previous movie Central intelligence."
"263",4.5,"  Entertaining thanks to his charming cast specially from jack black and karen gillian."
"264",3.5,"  great character developement, geek becomes a ""rock,rock becomes a geek, beauty becomes a beast, and wallflower becomes a rose."
"265",4,"  surprisingly charming and engaging film - I didn't realize I wanted to see this, but while watching it I realized that it was exactly the entertainment I needed"
"266",5,"  We loved this film on so many levels! We've seen it twice and would happily go again. The theme, continuity, and acting was wonderful and believable. (as far as being caught in a video game can ever be.) Black was brilliant, i will see this again or need to own it. Hilarious!!!"
"267",5,"  I loved it! i think i enjoyed it more knowing that they weren't trying to replace a classic movie but rather continue it with someone else's STORY LINE."
"268",3.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle surpasses its original movie in entertainment value. by making it feel bigger at carried by multiple solid comedic actors. Its plot does suffer a little because of the generic VILLAIN, which thankfully doesn't become the movies main focus. Its a worthwhile watch for families !"
"269",4.5,"  This movie may have been my favorite comedy of the year. My expectations were not exceptionally high for this remake. The original jumanji is a timeless classic, and i'm glad to see this movie did not try to piggy back off of that. Jack Black is the star of the show in this film as he finds himself playing a teenage girl trapped in a fat man's body. he had the entire theater in tears by the end. despite the hard carry from jack black all the other characters were also well written and portrayed. The video game world they chose to use worked perfectly with the story. the mix of comedy and performances from the star studded cast makes this a must see regardless of your opinion on the original."
"270",4,"  WHEREAS THE ORIGINAL WAS MORE SERIOUS WITH SOME COMEDY TONES, THIS IS FLAT OUT COMEDY AND IT WORKED WELL. jACK bLACK AS A TEENAGE GIRL ALONE IS WORTH THE WATCH."
"271",5,"  this is a must watch movie."
"272",5,"  Damn. I loved it, Hilarious"
"273",4,"  I am going to be completely honest with you......when i heard they were making a ""Reboot"" of the Robin williams Classic, ""Jumanji"" I wasn't on board with that; When Robin williams passed I felt that the magic and comedic aspect that went with the movie passed along with him. And while the movie became a cult classic the thought of a sequel, NEVERTHELESS a reboot with Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson and Kevin Hart was out of the question. ...I can admit when i'm wrong. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, is a somewhat 'Reboot' and moreso a Sequel to the 1995 Cult Classic starring the Late Robin williams and a teenage Kristin Dunst; set a year or two directly after the sequel we find that the game evolved with the times (cause who like board games anyways?) and four high school teenagers are caught in its web (or Drum snares) and are instantly sucked into the game itself where they have to play the game to LITERALLY survive the experience. The concept/story is simple enough but even a simple story needs good actors to carry it along and normally when you think of adventure stars Kevin hart and Jack black wouldn't be the names to pick out of a hat but along with Dwayne Johnson and Dr. Who/Guardians of the Galaxy star Karen Gilliam it evens the playing field in a way both funny as well as semi-heartwarming. Jack Black playing a girl trapped in a man's body is interesting but funny all the same; while I wouldn't say he stole the show he did make this movie all the more funny. Kevin Hart as ""Fridge/ZOOLOGIST"" is basically kevin hart in this role. he plays pretty much the same characters as he does in other films but it works for this movie and teaming up once again with his partner in crime The Rock makes for some fun and lighthearted moments and some laugh out loud instances. Karen Gilliam as the awkward teenage girl turns badass is also a welcoming change to the group she's every bit a funny as the guys are and she works well along with the rock. The movie takes ALOT of nods to the Animated show (yes there was an animated series in the 90s), and some call backs from the 1995 movie which was a nice easter eggs bringing the old with the new and while they do add these easter eggs the movie itself can also work as a stand along movie as well so you don't have to watch the original to gain understanding but if you want to SWEETENED the deal you can watch the original movie and watch this for an added effect. The movie changes the rules making a board game into a video game; drawing out all the aspect of how video games are done. even the NPCs in the game act EXACTLY how an npc character acts (repeating the same lines, etc) they the actors play on it which makes it funny until its not. And while they do explain while Karen's Character is dressed skimpy some people (mostly SJWs) might not like her appearance. The Main antagonist Bobby Cannavale (Van Pelt.....maybe related?) is very weak; he doesn't do much except be scary and make the story flow. I felt that he couldn't have done alot more but I don't know if the writing allowed much room for him to break out. The fifth player, played by Nick Jonas who's backstory i won't spoil it here is also a interesting change of pace. Even though he shows up much later in the movie he does bring a bit of the Robin williams-ish to the role; There were some creepy moments and some death scenes that won't settle for kids as well as some minor adult humor but still this movie works for both kids and adults. In the end. This is a SURPRISINGLY very fun movie. This can work as a stand alone movie as well as a sequel; while the story is simple enough and the bad guy was very Marvel MCU weak the premise is very engaging and laugh out loud funny. Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle is a movie i'm glad I got to see and i would see again as well as the original....now if they can do a sequel to ""Zathura"" with the same four Teens and same four actors then you got my money!! 4 out of Five stars Chris W. Aka That black guy who reviews movies!!"
"274",3,"  Si un remake de jumanji n'était pas rÃ©ellement indispensable, il faut avouer que cette version mise au goÃ»t du jour (les jeux vidÃ©os remplaÃ§ant les jeux de sociÃ©tÃ©) est tout de mÃªme fort sympathique avec un humour plutÃ´t rÃ©ussis qui ne va pas dans les blagues ""pipi/caca"" et une performance intÃ©ressante de jack black (c'est assez inusitÃ© qu'on mÃ©rite d'en parler) . une agrÃ©able surprise."
"275",4.5,"  Boy this film has legs! It's still doing several millions weekly in the US, far more than Star Wars is taking.Really fun movie, despite a really simple generic plot and one-dimensionable generic villain - that's really not a criticism either.A bit slow to start but once it got started my whole family loved it. The stars' chemistry and offscreen friendship really shines through and Jack Black proved to me he is a pretty good actor when he's not being full-on Jack Black.There are a couple of callbacks to the 90s Jumanji film but it works really well as a standalone.Loses half a star for low-quality CGI pantherS."
"276",4,"  GenreAge RatingLemonradarAction/Adventure10+80% sweetIntroductionHi, I am Keaton Marcus from Sweet and Sour Movie Reviews and today I will be reviewing the sequel/reboot to the film Jumanji starring an all star cast. When four teenagers, Spencer, Jeanette, Bethany and Fridge are sent to detention for doing various things they are forced to clean up an old warehouse, though when Spencer finds an old Video Game, the teens are intrigued into playing, but they find out this is no normal Video Game when they get sucked into it after choosing characters, Spencer, the wimp is now Dr. Smolder Bravestone, the champ, Fridge, the football player is Dr. Moose Finbar, Zoologist and Weapons Valet, Jeanette the introvert to Ruby Roundhouse, badass warrior and Bethany, popular high-school girl into overweight Dr. Sheldon the map specialist. When they find out that they have only three lives in the game and strengths and weaknesses they must find out how to save the game and go back home.How Was The Cast?In this second paragraph I will be telling you if the cast performed well or not. For our first main character we have Dr. Smolder Bravestone who is played by Dwayne Johnson. I thought that Mr. Johnson just found another suitable role for himself combining his badass former roles to a quite charming, funny and well developed character, there were some narrative problems as there were in every action movie, but Mr. Johnson did just fine at brushing those problems away. Overall Dwayne Johnson did a good job on providing his classic entertainment to the audience while giving something new. For our second main character we have Dr. Sheldon played by Jack Black. I really think Mr. Black should win something for this role, I mean this was the real classic laugh-out-loud kind of performance as the perfect character for him, good jokes, funny script and fit in just right with the plotline. Overall Jack Black has just again proved that he still has his charming appearance in Comedy movies. For our third main character we have Ruby Roundhouse who is played by Karen Gillan. I thought for a very new actress Ms. Gillan did an amazing job on this new kind of action/comedy movie, you know her as Nebula in the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies so this is a very new, uncomfortable role for her and she did just fine bringing her charm from former roles into this very important character in the film. Overall Karen Gillan was a little shaky at times, but on the whole provided a highly watchable, intriguing character that the audiences were deeply satisfied with. For our fourth main character we have Dr. Moose Finbar played by Kevin Hart. Mr. Hart is very used to these kind of roles, almost every movie he is in is a comedy/action movie and he was really just made for these kind of scripts and he did just that in Jumanji. Overall Kevin Hart is a comedy veteran and for that reason he was just perfect for this genius, comedic role of Moose Finbar. On the whole the cast had to deal with some flaws but were very used to the comedic atmosphere and were well chosen for the movie.QualityIn this third paragraph I will be telling you if the overall quality in the movie was any good or not. First we will start with the directing. I thought that Jake Kasden did a very good job on creating not just a good action movie, but a seriously funny premise, good, creative characters and a reboot that was much better than the lackluster original, I also thought that Mr. Kasden did not just focus on the funny script, but a decent story and plot line too that really made sense and worked with the title of the film. Overall Jake Kasden has just created a very successful reboot/sequel to a bad first movie with developed characters, a sensible story and just a really nicely directed film. Next we have the visuals, CGI and the cinematography in the movie. First we will start with the visuals and CGI. I thought this was an amazing part in the movie, but what was good about this was that it was not a CG fest and they had a balanced way of combining awesome 3D visuals and a good movie with a surprisingly reasonable 90M budget. Also there was a good variety of decent visuals, creative animals, cool, slick and fun action scenes and really everything a good visual movie should hope for. Now we have the filming in the movie. I thought that like the visuals, this was very cool and one of the best strengths in the movie, with all of those awesome 3D moments, the camera always stayed on track unlike most stupid action films. Overall the filming and the CGI work was exceptional, but also not too much and worked together in a very excellent and creative way. Last but not least we have the storyline in the movie. I was really surprised at the quality in the story, the film gave just enough time to let the visual flash and the smarts of the film to shine in great ways, the story and plot made sense, it was deeply creative, cool, fun and very entertaining. Overall the storyline was very well constructed, and thoroughly meant for entertainment.Aging 'The Jungle'In the fourth paragraph I will be telling you if this movie is for kids or not. First we will start with the violence in the film. Obviously there are explosions, gunfire, evil animals and other maybe scary stuff that will affect the younger kids, but for the older ones it is no problem. Next we have the bad language scattered in the film. There are some uses of ass, s..t, hell, damn and one use of boob, but nothing to strong for older kids and is very normal for these kinds of action films. Last but not least we have the sexuality in the movie. There is one reference of erection, tons of flirting and mentions of kissing, one character does have a skimpy outfit and some mild stuff about being good-looking. Overall there is action type violence, some scares, mild uses of language and yes, some sexuality. Based on this information I give the film an age rating of 10+."
"277",4,"  SURPRISINGLY good entertainment.. you will not stop laughing."
"278",4.5,"  A really funny and interesting movie, Its a really good movie to watched in family,but it somethings contains some lame jokes.Sorry"
"279",4.5,"  Dwayne johnson & jack black are awesome in this film"
"280",0.5,"  THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD. HAS NOTHING FROM THE ORIGINAL AND THE HOLE NEW STORY WAS SO BAD."
"281",4.5,"  'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is such a fun movie! The cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan are all amazing in this movie and work so well together. The movie is also very funny and entertaining."
"282",4,"  Solid 9/10 fun. Loved the different character theme and homage to original film. Great time, ate the whole tub of popcorn!"
"283",5,"  A great rendition of the classic!"
"284",5,"  Loved it. Can't say much more other than it really exceeded my expectations."
"285",4,"  I expected to hate it...I expected it to be like the first and really boring, it was inventive, amusing and enjoyable. Cheesy, but still a easy and enjoyable watch!"
"286",4.5,"  A very funny movie with cool effects and a cool concept."
"287",4.5,"  Movie was pure fun. Enjoyable to watch and just as fun as the original. Not meant to replace, just an addition to the imagination of the idea and story. Loved it."
"288",1.5,"  This new story killed the original Jumanji. It is all again the same American values, guy likes girl, girl like guy. I am so tired, bored and disappointed that the US only sells the same story over and over again. Holiwood wake up, don't be afraid to explore other ways to express your society thoughts. Look at Guillermo del Toro movies. He is a genious. He brings imagination back to live. Jumanji supposed to be with animals being the center of the attention and the director just turned the story into an American loving cheese story again. Boring boring boring. I wish I can get back my 1hr of life after wasting it churching this movie."
"289",4,"  Very fun movie! The interaction between Kevin Hart and the Rock is great. Perfect movie for a date or with the family. I would recommend it."
"290",5,"  I can't believe I liked it. I thought it would be a lame reboot but it wasn't."
"291",5,"  Great movie, was laughing my ass off the whole time. Definitely one of the best comedy's i've seen in a long time. Would definitely recommend"
"292",5,"  I haven't laughed so much in a long time, especially Jack Black was amazing as a girly teenager and helped to remember that deep inside the adventurer were other characters.It also showed off the type off video games nowadays are popular."
"293",4,"  A thoroughly enjoyable if not a tad shallow comedy flick that is fun from start to finish."
"294",4.5,"  Jumanji was hilarious and well made. Although the plot veered slightly with the appearance of Nick Jonas' Alex, the movie kept me engaged throughout. The characters were lovable and their conflicts felt real. Good movie overall."
"295",3.5,"  It was a refreshing family movie. Bringing back an updated twist to the original movie."
"296",2.5,"  An OK film that doesn't come close to filling the shoes of the original."
"297",2.5,"  It was hilarious, but I'm giving it 2.5 stars simply for the excessive cursing in a movie aimed towards kids."
"298",2,"  Def not as good as first one. Disappointing."
"299",5,"  This a worthy movie as a sequel to the original. It is funny, fun and has a great plot and storyline. Go see."
"300",5,"  Great movie with links to the original. Glad we watched it as it was full of laughs. A must see"
"301",2,"  Pathetic. The dialog was so cheesy."
"302",4,"  Definitely funny and action-packed to boot, Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle takes its source material to fresh and entertaining levels with its talented cast--including Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart--who give terrific and hilarious performances."
"303",3,"  In the end its just another solid comedy.But to be fair is has a good cast and some pretty funny scenes."
"304",4.5,"  It's been a very long time since I could sit through an entire movie and not hear someone laughing. I was a bit skeptical going into this movie but after 2 unsuccessful attempts to watch this movie (the previous two being sold out during weeks 4 and 5), I was finally able to reveal at the pure magic this movie brought to the audience. I very much enjoyed the tribute to Alan Perish... as a child I could only imagine what it was like stuck in the game and now we finally get to witness it."
"305",4,"  Funny with action. Im sure Robin Williams would have love it."
"306",2,"  Kevin Hart,. is the star of this movie. The guy is just pure funny. But See the original movie with Robin Williams,, you will see the difference."
"307",4.5,"  Love it. Great movie for the kids as well. Jack Black is perfect in his roll."
"308",4,"  If you like cute, you'll like Jumanji. No thrills, no chills, just a few smiles. If you can't get into the game, then it's over. Somebody's going to die! I liked Game Night better, but Dwayne needs to make a movie a month so.....here you go. For an $8 ticket, you'll get $8 worth of entertainment."
"309",5,"  A seemingly casual game that teachers teenagers that looks and popularity shouldn't be their main focus. Also really entertaining with a great cast."
"310",4,"  Absolutely worth seeing, very funny a good family outing to the movies."
"311",4.5,"  Mindless fun, and the ""smolder"" haha. I was pleasantly surprised with how good this movie turned out. its fun start to finish. My only complaint is that it starts to veere into what could have been some serious right in the feels stuff in the 3rd act, and then pulls its punch to gut at the last second."
"312",4,"  Surprisingly hilarious"
"313",4.5,"  Perfect family entertainment!"
"314",4,"  Saw Jumanji about a week after the Last Jedi. Talk about shattered expectations. I was hoping to be blown away by how good Jedi would be and didn't expect much for Jumanji. Jumanji ended up being the better movie by far. It was funny (deliberately) and enjoyable. The story and plot were actually more believable than that other Christmas movie (jedi)."
"315",2.5,"  A so-so remake. A little too silly for adult entertainment. However there were some interesting twists and turns, especially with the character Martha and Bethany. Good counter-traits. The other guys were kind of ho-hum, or pretty much what you'd expect."
"316",2.5,"  Scary concept that makes for a good adventure. Would?ve added half a star if the ?trans? message wasn?t so blatant. Not a fan of the ?empower the underdog teenager? idea ? it definitely wasn?t carried across well."
"317",4,"  FUN MOVIE FOR OLD LIKE ME AND MY TEENAGERS"
"318",3,"  In general, Jumanji is a good movie. It's an overall positive experience. It has very funny moments and the character development is very well done. You feel for them and can relate. However, there is nothing super special about Jumanji. 60%"
"319",3,"  I'm not impressed by the recreation, especially when characters are handed specific plot keys, and without them Dwayne probably would have been punching trees. I guess I'm just not used to this extra body part."
"320",4.5,"  I was not excited to see this based on the original, but this movie is one of my favorites in the last 4 years. Very well done, good story, and good humor."
"321",3.5,"  No Substance, but a fun romp that doesn't overstay it's welcome."
"322",2.5,"  The teenage main characters' personalities seem penned-in with little integrity, depicting basic personas in equality with the acting capabilities. As the movie unwraps, the performance improves along with dialogue and plot focus, making this film a nice updated and unique remake of the original. However, in comparison with the Robin Williams version it still lacks substance as the characters are never really introduced with any significance, which leads to a seeming lack of both loyal and empathetic depth. Despite this, the characters still display honourable duties to each other, overcome personal and socio issues, and subtly highlight dangers of phone/technology addiction, with the ironic twist of being trapped inside a computer game. All in all a great piece of comic relief."
"323",4.5,"  This was a fun movie. good structure, good characterization. The reboot was plausible and having the actors have to play characters that were avatars of teenagers created an element to the story that was hilarious."
"324",4,"  72/100El mayor triunfo de ""Jumanji 2: Welcome to the Jungle"" es que no termino siendo el despropósito que todos esperaban, y es que ciertamente nadie pidiÃ³ esta secuela de la original de 1995, pero parece que todos estÃ¡n muy agradecidos con esta, y es que en tÃ©rminos generales, la pelÃ­cula es buena y disfrutable, aunque no tanto como la opiniÃ³n generalizada del pÃºblico te puede hacer creer, y es que todos sus elementos (reparto, direcciÃ³n, guion, diseÃ±o de producciÃ³n, etc.) son correctos y en cierta medida satisfactorios, aunque para un servidor, la pelÃ­cula no termina de relucir y sacar provecho de ellos, logrando ser una pelÃ­cula blanda y normalita (y ya ni se diga que es predecible), aun cuando la actuaciÃ³n de Jack Black sea muy divertida de ver."
"325",4,"  the whole family had a blast! It isn't a good movie or anything, but it is just played over the top by the adult cast - it was hilarious! There were a couple of scenes I burst out laughing in the theater.The villain was dumb, the child actors were not great, the plot was kinda dumb - reminiscent of the 1995 Jumanji movie I can only vaguely recall. But this has the Rock so who cares? (although San Andreas was REALLY hard to watch - bad Rock - BAD!)."
"326",5,"  This Movie is one of the funniest movies of 2017. I really liked Kevin Hart's Character in this movie his character is one of the funniest characters in this movie."
"327",2.5,"  This was a terrible movie. I still don't trust my neighbor for saying I would enjoy it!"
"328",4,"  Loved this movie and loved how they still payed respect to the original, along with updating it for all the kids who play video games now."
"329",4,"  It's not trying to be anything more then its own stand alone film. Which is good! It's not trying to replace the original and instead plays a pleasant tribute to it"
"330",4.5,"  It is a very good fun family movie. Got me to laugh and enjoyed the movie for what it is, a fun comedy action movie."
"331",3.5,"  First half is super funny and the second half is too serious."
"332",4.5,"  Exciting, funny, clever! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is well made and a great film! I highly recommend it! The only thing keeping it from me giving it a five star review is excess innuendo. Besides that, it was pure awesomeness!"
"333",4.5,"  Not the best remake, but very entertaining"
"334",4,"  Good film much more enjoyable than the Satr Wars rubbish that was on at the same time."
"335",3.5,"  A fun romp, not groundbreaking, but certainly 2 hours well spent laughing."
"336",4,"  Surprisingly decent. I liked the tongue in cheek humour and the nod to the original movie. The cast have a brilliant chemistry and it was they that really made this movie something worth watching."
"337",3,"  Exceptionally hilarious and enjoyable movie. Don't see it for some compelling story, this is just a lighthearted good time."
"338",4.5,"  Very good film, packed with funny moments and a pretty good story"
"339",4.5,"  It was a funny movie"
"340",4,"  Action and laughter make for a nice night at the movies"
"341",3,"  Fun movie to watch with friends, mediocre all around. The humor is what you'd expect. Generic story, predictable at times, but can get a laugh every once in a while. The video game aspect of it left a lot to be desired. Unarguably the best part about it is Jack Black, but that's the only thing that shines from this movie."
"342",3.5,"  Stupid but fun. That basically sums it up"
"343",4.5,"  Didn't have high expectations. It was actually funny."
"344",5,"  Super good and funny!"
"345",3,"  this went from ""really a Jumanji remake?"" to ""you know I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel"" The Rock manages to respect the original yet completely reskin it and it almost feels like a completely different franchise"
"346",4,"  Hilarious!! Awesome fun movie!"
"347",4.5,"  Jumanji was so funny and entertanin. You will just fall for some of the charecters in theis movie. I highly recomed it to more macher vewier and not littel kids of inapraprit people. It is avery good movie to wach with freind of family."
"348",1.5,"  Not a kid-friendly movie unless you want your kids to see predictable sexual innuendoes. The movie fell flat and was a missed opportunity to pay more detail to the story and cut out the simplistic slapstick humor.It's mildly funny. Looking back I'm not sure if would even Redbox it though."
"349",4.5,"  Glad I went to see this, I almost didn't but I made the right decision. So humorous!"
"350",3,"  Light drama with a cheesy stereotypical love story and a lovely comedy with the Iconic Kevin Hart, but it wasn't the best film, I think 3 stars is best for this film."
"351",5,"  Great action adventure and comedy"
"352",4,"  way better than I was expecting it to be. everyone in it legitimately made me laugh a lot, specially jack black"
"353",5,"  One of Karen's best movies :D"
"354",5,"  Great movie, brilliant actors, amazing cinematography, & I thought it was very well written."
"355",4.5,"  Sequels don't normally work, but jumanji wttj totally worked. Quite possible better than the first film at least to me it was."
"356",4.5,"  I really liked this movie. Acting was great and the nodes to the original movie were fantastic! Great movie for video game fans!"
"357",3.5,"  A fan of the original, I was skeptical about the remake. It turned out to be a fun little romp for the eleven year old and myself to take in together."
"358",5,"  absolutely funny film."
"359",3,"  was just alright just lacking a bit"
"360",3,"  It's the comedy that makes this movie great. As a huge fan of The Rock & Kevin Hart, it's not possible to not have a good time. But it can be really cheesy and corny at times, reminds me of a Disney movie. But that's why it works for everyone."
"361",5,"  Truly one of 2017's most fun and entertaining movies. Hilarious cast, great premise, & one of henry jackman's best scores."
"362",4.5,"  Hilarious. One of the funniest movies I've seen in recent history."
"363",4.5,"  Surprisingly amusing and entertaining. Light-hearted fun, and love the tongue-in-cheek criticism of society in general. Watch and enjoy."
"364",4,"  This was a pretty fun show. Definitely exceeded my expectations. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while!"
"365",3.5,"  More enjoyable than the first one, but still surprised it was so huge."
"366",4.5,"  Great fun movie. What an adventure and blast from the past.Good Actor chemistry."
"367",4.5,"  This was one of the most fun times that I have had at the movies. Jack Black plays a better teenage girl than an actual teenage girl could have. He was probably the highlight of the film. The jokes in this movie landed every time. The entire cast does great and plays really well off each other. Its just a very fun movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun."
"368",5,"  What a great movie! Fun, entertaining and funny! I didn't go in expecting much but was surprised! A must see movie for the whole family!"
"369",5,"  I loved jumanji welcome to the jugle. Nice casting"
"370",5,"  Jack Black says, ""anime"". I know what anime is. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
"371",3.5,"  Cute movie. Some parts were funny, but I didn?t laugh too hard."
"372",3.5,"  No puedo creer lo mucho que me reí con Jumanji. Carcajadas sin parar con esta ingeniosa secuela. Jake Kasdan se las manda con una modernizaciÃ³n del concepto y Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan y Jack Black la rompen con su explosiva quÃ­mica. Buena banda sonora de Henry Jackman igual."
"373",5,"  Hilarious movie with a great cast."
"374",5,"  This won't win any oscars, and don't go into it thinking it might. What it is....a good time at the movies. Funny and entertaining. Had no expectations going in except a couple fellow parents word of mouth that it was good. Came out thinking....that may have been most fun I've had in a theater in past year. A few curse words, but overall really fun movie for teenagers, families, and anybody who played RPG video games from the 90's on. Loved it."
"375",3.5,"  I had a lot of fun with this movie as Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart all were really great in the roles they were in. It got bad as it went on but for the most part it's a solid movie and I hope that a sequel happens."
"376",5,"  What a surprisingly great film. Was very skeptical and thought it would be a campy testosterone fest. Very funny and great character development. This is the only movie I like the Rock in."
"377",4,"  It's fun and fantastic. At no time do you get bored. But its relationship with the original version, of 1995, is not fully understood."
"378",4,"  It's exactly what you want from this kind of movie."
"379",4,"  A really good film. Even if there are a few weak moments."
"380",4.5,"  Just another action movie from the Rock. No more. No less entertaining? Sure. Special? No. Fun yet tedious at points."
"381",3.5,"  Strengths: The team of Dwyane Johnson (Dr. Smolder Bravestone) and Kevin Hart (Franklin Finbar) is a hilarious one that worked even better here than it did in Central Intelligence. Everything Hart did was hilarious. Karen Gillan (Ruby Roundhouse) and Jack Black (Prof. Sheldon Oberon) were both very good, as well. Seeing all these characters being uncomfortable in their new avatars made for several hilarious moments. This also had the tall task of following the original Jumanji, which is kind of a cult hit. They did very well to stay a bit true to the original, while still being fresh on its own. The writing and dialogue is solid, while the special effects are very good.Weaknesses: The film lacked a strong antagonist. While Bobby Canavale (Russel Van Pelt) is a good actor, the character barely got any real development. He felt very one-dimensional and the insects constantly crawling on him felt out of place. Also, while I understood the need to establish the teenagers in their normal world, it can't help but feel like filler, because we all want to get to the jungle portions of the movie with the bigger stars. Also, while Jack Black is funny at times, he can come across as over the top at others. Overall: It's not a movie you go into expecting Oscar-worthy stuff. This is exactly what it should be. A good old fashioned popcorn flick. You won't have much more fun at the movie theater with many other films."
"382",3.5,"  I thought it was a good film but maybe a little to silly. I thought the acting was fine and it was like riding adventure ride at a theme park. Over all good but not Great!"
"383",3.5,"  Having grown up watching the original 'Jumanji' film a countless number of times, it's healthy to have doubts about what a modernization let alone a complete reboot/re-imagining would turn out to be. However, despite this film's sub-title borrowing from a 2003 Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson vehicle (or 'The Rundown', 2003), this film is a surprising and largely entertaining treat that delivers on all the goods an adventure flick, especially one set within in a video game rather than surrounding a board game unexpectedly does. One of it's biggest deliveries in entertainment is the charming cast, who're all acting against their own type as the avatar's of teenagers stuck in a video game world (Jack Black, especially!). Even when the film adds some small tribute to the late Robin Williams of the original film's fame, this film is more of a uniquely conceived and executed wild ride, rather than borrowing anything from the original film at all. Overall, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is a largely fun, hilarious and outrageously entertaining ride that matches any escapist material viewers might be looking for. Even for a film with a huge focus of being stuck within a video game world, adhering to video game mechanics, skills and rules, which can be questioned but also experienced as entertainment at the same time."
"384",3.5,"  Not a Amazing Comedy but stands out from others with good individual performances and good chemistry between the cast"
"385",3.5,"  This is fun and different from the vintage Jumanji. Both of them are good but this one will make you laugh a lot."
"386",5,"  Jumanji provides a fresh, enjoyable action adventure for the casual viewer, and a nostalgic, somewhat multi-layered film for those a little more serious in the film watching game."
"387",2.5,"  Welcome to the Jungle steps down from its predecessor and takes the fun road. Ultimately, the saunter is amusing but not iconic."
"388",4,"  Surprisingly very good and entertaining. The storyline, the actors, they were all good. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
"389",3,"  switch off and enjoy"
"390",4,"  Entertaining and funny. This is an example of a well succeeded remake. While the Robin Williams-Jumanji got stuck in its own incapability of producing believable CGI-animals this one is making up for ALL of that. It's suitable for a large audience and addresses up-to-date issues the world is struggling with. The cast is a steady group of actors who were well prepared before shooting started and it works. If you wanna have a roller coaster-fun-time then go see this movie. Again you can see the big difference between the critics and audience reviews. I would advice, stick to what the audience says. Those are the most honest opinions. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter"
"391",5,"  I love this movie and the scenery so much"
"392",5,"  Enjoyable movie with charismatic likable characters. When it comes to sequels, Hollywood gets it right every once in a while."
"393",5,"  Jumanji 2 was awesome.It has good fundamentals, plays fair with the audience, and invests a strong cast with enough character to elevate the material."
"394",4.5,"  Kevin Hart is not funny at all and really the only person to play himself. Loud and annoying and always swearing. The real stand outs in this movie were Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, & Karen Gillan. Nick Jonas was okay too."
"395",3.5,"  I was really thinking was not going to like the movie grown up with the first movie of the 90s but like this one i have said it"
"396",2,"  It it wasn?t for Kevin Hart....the movie would have been unwatchable."
"397",2.5,"  typical creativity starved hollywood popcorn seller. over-hyped but hey. its gonna sell when the alternatives are limited to TLJ."
"398",5,"  Dwayne Johnson has worked way to hard to get to the top of hollywood for him to give it all up now. Jumanji Welcome to the jungle was a great film, & i'm proud of the guy for continuing to work hard."
"399",4,"  I'm no big fan of remakes, and I did see the original with Robin Williams. I was totally impressived, it made me laugh, action packed movie with lots of thrills, right to the end of the movie."
"400",4,"  Good humor movie. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) shoulda broke out in his WWE ""can ya smell what the Rocks got cookin!!!"""
"401",4,"  Fun. Fun. The rock doing rock things"
"402",4,"  A Very fun film! Worth seeing in theaters!"
"403",5,"  love this movie it was funny and very adenturousness"
"404",5,"  Jumanji sequel was an amazing based off the novel. People need to get over their nostalgia. This generation loves it."
"405",4,"  Good fun movie, well worth watching."
"406",3.5,"  most of the comedy was more... adult jokes in a way of a joke about the privates many jokes."
"407",2,"  A completely unnecessary and unsatisfactory remake of the far superior original."
"408",2.5,"  Better than expected. I didn't see the original so can't offer comparisons."
"409",3.5,"  Thoroughly entertaining revival of the brand. It says what it does and does what it says. Buy popcorn. Prepare kids for a bit of raunch from Kevin Hart that is wholly unnecessary and unfunny. Enjoy yourself."
"410",3.5,"  This is a very fun family flick that's well acted, well made, and has some good clever aspects to it. Kevin Hart though is a little too Kevin James-ish for my taste and the world isn't very consistent at times. The villain is kind of bland, but I'd definitely would buy on dvd."
"411",3.5,"  Fun family movie. The rock kills it once again."
"412",2.5,"  I do not like this film. It is full of babyish humor. Maybe there is Dwayne Johnson in main role but I really did not like it."
"413",3,"  It was fun, but not as developed and interesting as the first Jumanji. It stands on its own but I loved the first Jumanji and was hoping for a similar story."
"414",4,"  Better than I expected."
"415",5,"  I really liked this one. It's not a super deep movie or anything, but it is enjoyable and fun. It is funny, moves at a good pace, and has a simple story. I don't think too many people will sit down and watch this and not at least have a bit of entertainment."
"416",3,"  Good fun - that does not crap over the memory of Robin Williams. The Rock playing a nerd occupying the body of The Rock worked surprisingly well. Jack Black channelling camp to play a regular social media obsessed girl less so. Go see either now or when it appears at Christmases to come ***.25"
"417",5,"  Very funny!!! Was presently surprised!"
"418",5,"  Very fun movie to watch. I was well entertained"
"419",2.5,"  Jumanji is a solid meaningless comedy with a good cast and quirky personalities. Nothing offensive, nothing amazing. The plot and villain were weak but that could be due to the idea of the movie playing in an old eighties videogame."
"420",2,"  Awful like everything with 'The Rock'"
"421",4,"  Good movie. It keep you distracted and maintain the attention all the time. I recomend it"
"422",5,"  Really solid, really fun. Didn't try to do more than it needed to and did what it stuck to very well. Stayed well-paced and light. Definitely recommend."
"423",3.5,"  A fun film that is difficult to compare to the original. The story is brought up to date with many references to modern day gaming. Good all round performances with plenty of giggles along the way but nothing that gives you the wow factor."
"424",4,"  Very good movie. Best (and only) movie I saw that was released in 2017. : )"
"425",2.5,"  I will say that I didn't enjoy this movie that much. I have to acknowledge there are some meaningful lines said from the characters, however, the plots are not attracting that much. Because the producer need to combine the jungle story with the teenager story, you need spend some time to introduce the teenager background, which is, in my opinion, a little bit redundant. This reduce the overall pace. If it is a pure jungle movie, action and adventure type, I will say it deserve more popcorns. But I do remember some meaningful lines (may not be exact the same ones because I cannot remember that clear):When you have only one life to spare, you have to treat it very seriously. You need to trust that you have this ability to fly the helicopter, just like I have the ability to become a dance fighter. If you dare push me again, I am gonna push back.Rely on each other and don't blink a second.The missing piece is not an object, it is you, pilot. Overall, teamwork, trust, emotion, caring for each other, brave, wisdom, sacrifice, all those quality the teenagers didn't have before, they gained it through the video game. Also very practical to our lives."
"426",4,"  Levels up the action, hilarity and fun-times"
"427",3.5,"  Oh wow The Rock, Jack Black and other people play Jumanji for real! I'd give it more stars if Robin Williams was in it, but SJWs forced him to kill himself."
"428",4.5,"  A combination of great theatrical elements, decent acting, and humor makes this movie a must watch. It is clear from the well written screenplay that the producers of the movie put hard work into creating an entertaining and unique film. The humor in the movie made the nail biting moments in the movie even more enjoyable, as it leaves the audience fretting over what will happen next, but simultaneously laughing."
"429",3,"  Average popcorn movie. Like the original more thrilling one"
"430",3.5,"  Funny and charming movie filled with intense action scenes but muddled by a thin plot and sometimes wooden acting. The humour is spot on yet you can't help but think about how senseless it is, an unneeded sequel but a rarity, one that is better than the original. A good movie for one-time viewers, though less interesting by the second view and dull by the third."
"431",4,"  Much better than I expected. And better than it deserved to be. A worthy sequel, though not as much fun as the original."
"432",4.5,"  Didin't think it would be that good. It was fun, exciting, and the cast just works."
"433",5,"  Absolute blast! I was hesitant to see it, but it was a great popcorn flick. Fun, adventure, and charm - what more could you want. Johnson & Hart are this generation's perfect movie duo!"
"434",5,"  One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time."
"435",4.5,"  Great Film.-Movie Man"
"436",3.5,"  Eh.... Itâ??s aÃ¢??ight."
"437",3.5,"  Do you like Video Games. Then you'll probably like this. Much better then I was expecting."
"438",5,"  Extremely surprised how good this was. Funny and entertaining. Good family movie"
"439",2,"  Not as good as the original... but I do love the Rock and Kevin Hart"
"440",3.5,"  Different from it's source but not in a bad way and becoming surprised with every actor in the movie and pointing out Jack Black on being an Underrated actor."
"441",3.5,"  I thought the film was fun, with brilliant effects and a decent story line. Obviously it is going to be compared to the original Jumanji, which I don't think it has the same heart and impact, but it is a good film in it's own right. Loved how they modernised the film to keep with todays society and social media ect."
"442",0.5,"  GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL ,ITS FAR SUPERIOR"
"443",4,"  a fun movie which respects its predecessor and doesn't try to take the advantage of nostalgia"
"444",4,"  This movie was far better and funnier than I originally thought it would be when it came out in December. Saw it last night and it was a lot of fun. Jack Black was amazing."
"445",4,"  ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is a sequel to the hit movie ""Jumanji,"" It is about four high schoolers who get sucked into a video game called ""Jumanji."" They become avatars in this game and are given challenges that enhance each of their character's inner strengths and weaknesses. Spencer Gilpin becomes Dr. Smolder Bravestone, Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson is Moose Finbar, Bethany Walker turns into Professor Shelly Oberon, and Martha Kaply plays as Ruby Roundhouse. They must fight must fight for their lives in order to survive the game, finish all the levels, and get back to the real world. And here is the scary part - if they die in the game, they are stuck in Jumanji forever! This movie is directed by Jake Kasdak, which is widely known for other popular movies, such as ""The Accidental Tourist,"" ""Silverado,"" and ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story."" The characters of ""Jumanji"" are played by some favored actors and actresses. Playing Dr. Smolder Bravestone is Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Heart as Moose Finbar, Jack Black as Professor Shelly Oberon, and Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse. The genre of this film is extensive in the sense that it contains comedy, drama, romance, adventure, science-fiction, and much more. It is rated PG-13, which makes this a great movie to watch with family or friends. A movie closely related to this one is ""Wreck it Ralph"" due to the fact that it runs the same way ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" does. Both movies have characters who are trying to complete tasks throughout a video game in order to succeed or survive to get to the end of the game. This movie works well for me because it was a great mix of humorous and adventurous. It keeps the audience wondering how the characters are going to survive, what strategies they will use, and how the ending may be because of the different character's strengths and weaknesses throughout the film. The angles in the camera were great, things looked realistic, yet cartoonish, as if in a real-life game. The camera was steady throughout the film in quiet and parts that require focus, yet there was a lot of close-ups and far shots when it was needed to be like that in those moments. The thing I would would change for this film is playing the four high schoolers as stereotypical types of students, because it gives us a hint of why the video game characters are their complete opposites, which is to teach them a lesson. The music was also very good in this movie as well as the sounds played throughout the film for animals, humans, weapons, and the ""magic"" aspect that makes up the whole film. Overall, I would say that this movie fits into most genres, specifically adventure and science-fiction. It is a fun-well rounded movie for families and teenagers, as well as adults!"
"446",3.5,"  Entertaining and funny!"
"447",4.5,"  I went to see this movie without knowing what I would get.I was nicely surprised as the cast is really nice, the humor is good and I didn't get bored during the movie.Of course we all know the story of Jumanji, but it's 2018 version of Jumanji.I would recommend to people who just want to have a great time and want to see a funny movie with very nice actors."
"448",1.5,"  Why did I watch this movie? Oh yea because I have enjoyed watching comedic movies with a similar cast like Central Intelligence ok I just like Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart who is a really cool guy I hear is like a mini bonus(no pun intended). Aside from a random Vegas scandal to detour fans from actually enjoying the film for what it is did not mess up the buzz. Afterall this is a sequel 22 years after a cutting-edge and successful movie starring the Late Great Robin Williams. My fave character he portrayed of his was Genie from Aladdin, but I digress. Jumanji switches it up for the times so it's a video game instead of a board game? Ok well-played yet this is the shortest video game ever. Where are all the cut scenes and easter eggs and oh yea I forgot Jumanji morphed into a 16-bit console system which is lame. Then you use new actors who we've never seen before and then give us avatars of people who we know. I must admit Jack Black can't save this movie all by himself, because actors tried their best to play a character that was younger and not them full of flaws and all. Yea teamwork hooray but NO. This movie was not that funny at all. I can't laugh at Kevin Hart or other people dying and respawning. It got old before it got old. I know there are giant animals and chase them and it didn't seem like a fun video game. Now to the actors credit I know I've been hard on you and I'm sure the shoot schedule was rigorous and you didn't get a chance to develop your characters but the story didn't enable the characters to rise to the surface in any way shape or form. It's like ok Maps, thats your job. Ok Dance Combat and you're like wtf. The characters don't even seem like friends in real life and we expect to follow them on this adventure. This is unique in a sense because you usually don't have well known actors playing kids aside from Bruce Willis in the cartoon Bruno the Kid and Tom Hanks in Big. And aside from Rob Schneider alot of actors doing comedy bits don't have a woman trapped inside them. I'm sure there are more movies but humor me this is a Jumanji review not a film lesson. So if you wanna watch it you can and you may laugh and you may be like man this plot sucks but hey don't say I didn't warn you because the consistency is off and I was glad it was over then was like... I actually watched this"
"449",3.5,"  Fun popcorn entertainment. The strength of the acting and the fun premise of awkward teenagers in the bodies of grown adventurers prop up a generic script. Jumanji is no Citizen Kane but it's certainly good for a couple of hours of entertainment."
"450",2.5,"  Simpatico film,per un paio d'ore di intrattenimento."
"451",3.5,"  Good movie to relax and turn my brain off to. The performances of those comedians are explosion!"
"452",5,"  A real surprise! I didn't except anything! I was a little sceptical! But to my surprise I discover a great movie!"
"453",5,"  wow, better than I expected, loved it, hope there is another one in the can down the road, seems to be the hit of the HOLIDAY season... still playing... go see it... better on the big screen"
"454",4,"  Quick, funny, and admittedly spectacular, this not only is a mostly satisfying sequel, but also an affectionately clever video game parody."
"455",5,"  Hilarious. All you have to say."
"456",1,"  I can't believe this movie gets good scores, it really isn't that good."
"457",5,"  Watched Jumanji this past weekend, & I haven't laughed in the cinema as much as I did in a long time, it was that good.?"
"458",4,"  4/5. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is surprisingly (to most people. I totally called it) really good. With charismatic performances and a lot of fun moments, this is really solid as far as sequels go. Not all of the humor lands, but for the most part, this is an all around solid movie."
"459",1,"  Please no. Funny in parts, but all-in-all, I won't get those hours back."
"460",0.5,"  Terrible acting and bad stereotypes, I'll leave it there"
"461",3.5,"  Funny, really funny. I loved Jumanji, the first one and I liked this. They did a good job recreating a new way to access to Jumanji world. I enjoyed."
"462",5,"  It is so refreshing to have a comedy that isn't reliant on making dirty/lewd jokes which is fine, but having an all around comedy makes it more interesting. This movie is highly entertaining and pays great tribute to the original movie while maintaining an originality of its own. The acting is great and I almost lost track of time.. That's how you know you're really enjoying a movie. Highly recommend this movie!"
"463",4,"  Funny movie with a good twist on the first one. Would recommend it if looking for a fun movie"
"464",5,"  I'd suck Jack Black cock! 10/10(not gay, cuz she's a chick IRL)"
"465",3,"  One of the best video game films...but thats not saying alot ."
"466",4.5,"  Movie was great. Well done!"
"467",4.5,"  Very funny. I entered to the movie without any expectations and without interesting, but now I want to see more."
"468",4,"  Fun movie worth the trip to the theater. Could have been better but its pretty good."
"469",4,"  funny, great performances. Its a nod to the classic one with a modern touch."
"470",4,"  Fun and games. So before board games had their recent renaissance, they went out of style for a stretch of time. To continue existing, the board game Jumanji had to adapt and become a video game (just go with it). When four high schoolers get entrapped in the game, they will have to work together to survive the dangers of the jungle and escape back to reality. I don't think there was hardly anybody that was looking forward to this. I know I most certainly wasn't. I don't really remember the original Jumanji all that well, and this was a sequel that nobody was asking for. I didn't really get excited for this until I heard a review that said that this had an actual script instead of having two hours of actors improvising, and that is the precise moment I started taking this seriously. The filmmakers pulled a fast one and ended up making a smart and wildly entertaining roller coaster ride that is fun for everyone. I totally get the decision to go with a video game in this over the board game. It makes sense so as to be more culturally relevant, and it also allows it to be more mainstream and have more appeal to today's youth. It was a choice that really paid off, and if you have a background in gaming, you're going to get a bonus layer of smart in-jokes, and it feels like they are there just for you. From NPCs that only have certain lines to say to typos in a game just because quality control wasn't always a thing throughout the years, you're going to have a really uproarious time with this. You do have to just roll with the setup, as it is probably the flimsiest part of the film, but they don't dwell on it, they just get it out of the way as quickly as possible to get you to Jumanji, and once you arrive, it is hilarous and entertaining to the end. On top of all that, you have honest to God chemistry between the four leads. They are all kids who have personalities that don't match the bodies that they are in, and it is a ridiculously good time to watch play out. They even imagine to utilize Kevin Hart correctly which happens less and less often as the years go on, and Jack Black really steals the show playing a teenage girl. There really isn't a weak link in the bunch, and you become invested in it because they build up the stakes. It's a huge surprise for me being that I don't have strong feelings for the original, and Jumanji is one of the biggest crowd pleasers of 2017."
"471",5,"  Wow...I'm a Rock fan as well as Hart AND Black fan, but this was a very pleasant surprise. It follow the main premise of the original movie but with a fresh direction and update to engage today's audiences. The parallels orchestrated with cell phones and video gaming were ingenious, while the comedic value and timing were spot on without being just down right stupid. I didn't by any stretch of the imagination intend on seeing this flick in the theatre, so believe me when I say it was an unexpected treat...If u haven't seen it, u don't have a reason not to now..."
"472",5,"  I loved it...hiarious, laughed throughout the whole movie. Jack Black was very funny portraying a female in a male body."
"473",4,"  Great movie! I personally thought this was one of those movies that was just fun to watch! With the humor, character development, and just how the story was put together made for, in my opinion, a very solid adventure comedy."
"474",5,"  An amazing movie, exceeded every expectation I had going in to it. As a fan of the original movie I was a little skeptical going into it, hoping they wouldn't ruin one of my favorite movies. Boy was I wrong, with an all star cast the movie was amazing. Jack Black was my personal favorite as he played a teenage girl, spot on. All the actors had me rolling in my seat, not wanting the movie to ever end. Fairly family friendly except for two scenes describing aspects of the male anatomy but that was the extent. Highly recommend going to see with older kids, a great movie for the whole family. I will definitely be purchasing this movie when it is available on dvd."
"475",4,"  Fun and entertaining take on the classic."
"476",4.5,"  very funny all the way through JACK BLACK is back. he has NOT done a good roll for years, this one he crashes it. interesting, exciting and funny."
"477",4.5,"  Very Entertaining, Fun for the whole family. Each actor played their character quite well. Loved the dance fighting scene!"
"478",4.5,"  Very good movie - Hilarious - Jack Black is excelent"
"479",5,"  great plot amazing action scenes i love the movie!!!"
"480",2.5,"  Honestly it was disappointing. Lotta hype and potential but didn't nail it"
"481",4.5,"  Really good movie. Karen and Dwayne were my favorites"
"482",4,"  Surprisingly better than I thought it'd be."
"483",4,"  Despite the lack of twists, Jumanji is for itself a surprise that earn points in originality and interest, it also counts with a talented cast to conquer spectator hearts and it has a lot of dazzling visual effects and powerfull action scenes and some funny laugh worthy scenes."
"484",5,"  What an amazing entertaining movie that was. Thoroughly loved it?"
"485",5,"  Fantastic movie for an entire family not just for kids.. Acting was perfect and the humor was so consistent. People, get off your high horse, quit being snobs, and go see this movie. Movies are supposed to be entertaining (reason why they're created in the first place) and I can recommend that this movie is HIGHLY entertaining."
"486",4.5,"  Better than the last jedi"
"487",4.5,"  Really good movie. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised."
"488",0.5,"  Weird sexual innuendo that was unnecessary Movie is targeting kids but made me and my family uncomfortable."
"489",4,"  Definitely worth watching twice, this movie is just so much fun !"
"490",5,"  Top 10 favorite of the year"
"491",4,"  So funny, it makes up for the poor story-line. Making fun of video games and awkward teenagers, this film is a ride you can enjoy."
"492",4,"  Well worth the watch other than the needless preoccupation with private body parts."
"493",5,"  The Rock+Kevin Hart+Jack Black= A hilarious action movie you shouldn't miss. This movie is wicked, suspenseful, and down right laugh out loud funny. People may say the first Jumanji is better, but they clearly haven't seen Kevin Hart ride an elephant. I say you should heading out the door right now to what I believe is one of the best comedies of 2017."
"494",5,"  Hilarious family movie. Fantastic sequel to the original. Must see. Film for all ages."
"495",5,"  An excellent 90s throwback flick. Met all my expectations, though I will admit they weren't super-high going in. With that said, it did not disappoint and was well worth the price of admission."
"496",5,"  Kevin Hart & the rock are amazing together"
"497",4,"  The cast is overshadowed by the incredible Karen Gillan whose skills are just getting acknowledged."
"498",3.5,"  fun movie good fun easy."
"499",5,"  Fun and funny, a great remake."
"500",3.5,"  Nice watch for when you have friends around. An easy movie to laugh at because of it's characters. They did a great job with casting. I don't usually like Jack Black, but I liked him in this movie. Seeing Nick Jonas was quite a surprise."
"501",4,"  totally fun, saved by The Rock"
"502",3.5,"  Not as magical as the original, but this has an extra dimension through the way the characters become different people inside the game.That allows for some ""deep"" readings of subtext... if you are so inclined especially around the Jack Black character.A fin trip, exciting but not about to scare the kids."
"503",4,"  I must admit that I enjoyed the film a lot. I wasn't expecting that at all and that's the reason why I ended up not watching it at the cinema. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes no one's positive opinion would have convinced me to go to the cinema. I am just such a fan of the original - I grew up with it - that I could think of absolutely no plausible connection between the original and a stand-alone sequel"" with The Rock, whom I actually like a lot, that didn't make the second one a really bad film made just for profit. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised and I hope you too!"
"504",4,"  This turned out to be a much funnier movie than I expected. The plot as a whole was so boring and formula that it could have been written by a computer - but there were these scenes nestled inside that were incredibly funny, with sharp, witty dialogue, well thought out characters, and excellent performances. Jack Black in particular was stellar - it was as if he was born to play the role of a fourteen year old girl."
"505",5,"  Love it, super funny."
"506",1,"  Couldn?t be bothered to watch it to the end."
"507",4,"  It seems it really is possible to make a good game movie."
"508",5,"  One of Dwayne Johnson's best performances"
"509",5,"  Such a great movie. Love the artwork, music, cast, & story."
"510",5,"  love this Movie, saw it two times! went in the first time not expecting much but i loved it, so did my grandma and gramps"
"511",5,"  Fantastic movie that honors the original while pushing new growth."
"512",5,"  Of of the best movie I've seen in years. Laugh out loud funny and great characters & action. Perfectly entertaining 10/10 would recommend it."
"513",4.5,"  Jumanji was good fun and I'd like to see it again"
"514",2,"  I've never seen a movie that has used every trope in the book. Good job on that!"
"515",3,"  i wished it wasnt called Jumanji because the original is quite a unique masterpiecebut the cast did well, Jack Black was perfect in every way. worth watching but nothing to remember"
"516",3,"  Do not take it seriously.the cast had a lot of fun with this, and I did, too. but remember it is essentially people in a live action video game. if you expect serious realism, you will be left out of the entertainment."
"517",3,"  Terrible intro, but fun movie. Boring end."
"518",3.5,"  Great movie, I do wish they had kept this a little more pre-teen friendly. The 10 year Olds would have enjoyed, without the girl turns to boy stuff, IMHO this was gratuitous, there was no need."
"519",1,"  The movie lacks any comedy and uses the same jokes that are lays used in a rock and Kevin hart movie. ie. ""Kevin Hart is short"", ""I'm the rock: a tough guy"". The best part about this movie was Jack Black who stole every scene he was in. He gave me the my only real laugh of the entire film. The movie has a hobble script and the directing is nothing new or special."
"520",5,"  Great cast and funny"
"521",3,"  Jumanji played to its casts (sometimes overdone) strengths in a way that was still consistently grounded in its premise."
"522",2,"  Didn't love this. Didn't hate it. Kept me somewhat entertained but ultimately forgettable."
"523",4,"  Super fun movie with great comedy and chemistry among the cast... Good action and wonderful FX. I actually liked it better than the original (I realize this is probably blasphemy to many fans)."
"524",5,"  Silly over the top fun."
"525",5,"  Epic! Dwayne Johnson & Karen Gillan were the best parts of the movie."
"526",1,"  really terrible. i laughed here and there. jack black was surprisingly decent, considering i normally hate him. but there are two reasons i hated this movie. 1) it was barely funny. so many parts were glaringly unfunny, jokes that don't land and have me straight-faced or worse, rolling my eyes. 2) so many ridiculously cheesy moments. cringe-worthy omg moments. laughing at how bad it is moments, you can do it, believe in yourself moments. smh. and some stuff made no sense. the villain use completely useless even tho i like the actor and he has proven he can be a great villain like in boardwalk empire. and the action was also completely useless nonsense. i'm not even talking about the super strength and stuff, i didn't mind that. but some of the other action scenes, omg, like... i basically checked out with like 20 minutes left, and i didn't even care to finish it (1 viewing)SPOILERS... the stampede helicopter chase, smh"
"527",5,"  Loved it becoz Kevin Hart got the best parts"
"528",5,"  This is one of my favorite films to release in 2017"
"529",5,"  More fun than I expected. The whole theater laughed out loud over and over again. So great!"
"530",3,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is an entertaining movie that picks up where the original left off, albeit this time as a comedy. While overall I found it enjoyable, the movie did often forget that it was a Jumanji film, and the e them play in other films. Hart is still funny playing himself, but the real stars are the other Dwayne Johnson who plays a shy and insecure boy (compared to buff an confident), Jack Black who plays a ""pretty girl"" who is obsessed with appearance and Instagram fame, and Karen Gillan who plays a nerdy girl who is awkward and insecure. Tworld of Jumanji falls to the sidelines.While is obvious from the trailers, this time the game of Jumanji is played in the form of the video game. Each character in the movie is playing a high-school aged persona, very different from the characters that each actor generally plays in films. To this end, is the main entertainment that the film brings, and is also my biggest complaint. While I enjoyed watching actors play characters that are out of their element, the movie was more about the actors playing atypical roles for themselves, and less about the world of Jumanji. This was my biggest problem with the movie. You are watching a variation of ""13 Going on 30"", ""Change Up"", or ""Freaky Friday"" more than you are a sequel to Jumanji.The longer the movie continues, the less the movie is about the world of Jumanji. By the third act of the film, the world of Jumanji is no more than a backdrop for the actors to continue goofing around and trying to sloppily wrap the story up with a good moral for the kids in the audience. We only really experience the world of Jumanji through 4 specific challenges, where each main character has their moment to shine as they are tailor-built to accomplish the challenge.The movie is predictable, and the animals, events, and challenges the actors face in the world of Jumanji are not as deep as the original film. The challenges are pretty easy and the actors make their way through it with relative ease. The introduction of a villain in this film was unnecessary, as overcoming the game should be more than enough conflict for our heroes (as it was in the first film), to interest and satisfy the audience. The villain was weak to the point of being forgettable (one of my friends actually forgot about this character completely).While the action/adventure portion of the film never grows legs, the comedy portion of the movie is where it really shines. Each actor and actress did a great job at playing characters that are out of their element and they are visibly enjoying doing so on-screen. Kevin Hart is the one actor who failed to really embrace his alternate persona (he plays the buff sports jock), as he defaults to the standard Kevin Hart routine of being black and being short jokes. Basically Kevin Hart plays himself, while the other actors really play something unique from what you sehese three do incredible jobs performing outside of their element and are really the stars of the show.Don't go into Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle expecting it to be an action-adventure as you will leave disappointed. However it does succeed at being a comedy and was still an incredibly entertaining time at the movies and will be a movie that adults and kids can watch together and have a great time.As a word of caution: this film is advertised as a family film, and keeps the gore to be non-existent (when people die they just dissapear, you don't ever see blood or gore). However there is a fair amount of adult language and adult jokes in the movie, making it hard to recommend for anyone with young children. Several jokes of male parts, several are drawn out significantly (Jack Black's character is technically a woman and spends about 90-120 seconds of screen time experiencing being a man for the first time). There are several similar comments/remarks/jokes throughout where she refers to her new-found body parts."
"531",4,"  Really good comedy movie. Funny and entertaining, doesn't overstay its welcome, fun to watch. Definitely recommended."
"532",5,"  Didn't think it was going to be that good, but I was so surprisingly blown away by the entire new take on Jumanji.Karen Gillan, took me almost the entire film to finally figured out where I have seen this total hottie before. (It was only like 2 seasons of Doctor Who). But besides the good looks, she totally rocked the inner nerd's attempt at being a sexy seductress. Totally comical.Dwayne Johnson turned in good performance in the type of roles he is very good at. Not Academy Awards worthy, but entertaining.Kevin Hart (congratulations on your prediction that the Eagles will soar over the Patriots!!!) and Jack Black were awesome supporting characters in this movie. Totally worth going to see twice or more. No wonder it ranked top of the Block Office again after being out more than 2 months."
"533",4.5,"  Plot stayed all in one. Great Cast, Funny Moments, Kevin Hart. Jack Black pretty much acting gay, its pretty hilarious."
"534",5,"  I'll admit that I was very skeptical when I saw that a new Jumanji movie was to be released. I loved the one with Robin Williams, and I'm tired of remakes, reboots, and even sequels to some extent. But as I saw more and more previews, I really began to change my opinion on whether I would see this movie. Finally got to see it last week, and I can't say enough great things about it. The premise of the story is the same: people get trapped in a game. But the way the story played out was new. The story was very well written. The action was fun. There was a lot of comedic events within the movie as well as some moments hat might make you tear up a little. The call-back to the original movie was brilliant. All the actors did a great job. I wish I had the time to see it again in the theater, but I can't wait until it comes out on iTunes so I can watch it again and again."
"535",4,"  Actually pretty decent. Funny and updated twist on the classic"
"536",4,"  Really cute and funny. This is a far departure from the original book, but I think a great improvement too."
"537",5,"  This film was SO funny. I watched this with one of my friends and we couldn't stop laughing."
"538",4.5,"  I think this is one of the best action comedies I've seen. The plot is built on nice character moments which both provide seriousness, comedy and actually grow the characters. The sense of peril also feels real, and I had actual goosebumps in the theater. For the most part, the comedy hits home, but a couple of the gags were a bit juvenile for my tastes. Even those didn't break with the tone of the scenes though, so it didn't ruin my enjoyment. I would recommend this film to anyone."
"539",3.5,"  The story is a little bit predictable, but that is overshadowed by the great and funny performance of the actors."
"540",0.5,"  not enough niggas0/10. only one nigga, who was a lame ass"
"541",4.5,"  Funny film that keeps you on the edge of your seat ready for more! However, the humor levels go way down toward the ending, which in my opinion, the level should have gone up. Definitely worth a watch."
"542",4.5,"  Absolutely too much fun...!!!Highly recommend this one to everyone, worth not onyl seeing but seeing againThis passes my ""Blue Ray Test"" (is it worth owning permanently?)Critics as usual have too much to think about rather than simply telling us it is a good movie or not..This one is actually BETTER than the original, but the Critics are too busy 'defending their craft' to see it"
"543",5,"  What a good movie! With the amazing cast Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, I would see it again. One of my favourite movies."
"544",5,"  Pretty good for a sequel. Loved every minute of it"
"545",2,"  Divertida pero con pruebas muy básicas para los jugadores, nada inteligente ni emocionante y con un humor adolescente que se torna aburrido despuÃ©s de un rato. AdemÃ¡s, tuve la desgracia de verla en una sala con doblaje mejicano lo cual la hace mÃ¡s desesperante."
"546",4,"  Went to watch this movie with the wife as it was her turn to choose. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I enjoyed the flick from start to finish. Ruby Roundhouse is a babe!"
"547",3.5,"  Solidly entertaining."
"548",5,"  Afraid that this would be made purely for the nostalgia, and not respect the original, this was a giant surprise. I don't know why, the cast is stacked! The Rock brings it, in this and all his movies, but Jack Black is the runaway character!! Pushes the narrative forward, without disrespecting the original!"
"549",5,"  Funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny is all I have to say about that"
"550",2.5,"  I found this film fun, but it was not as thrilling and captivating as the trailers lead me to believe. Seeing it in 3-D was just as unfulfilling. In my opinion, this one is best for the DVDs. The original had a LOT more character."
"551",2,"  I was really looking forward to movie. It's a shame it was such a disappointment .The only thing that was good about this movie were the actors, who did their best with the downright awful and BORING dialogue.I found myself going to sleep after the 100th time that a character had to be motivated to continue on with something.Shame, the comedy was great at mostly, shame it's the story that didn't work out."
"552",4.5,"  Better than I figured for a -Part 2. Well worth the view!"
"553",0.5,"  not as funny as it could have been"
"554",3.5,"  Fun and entertaining. The original was better though."
"555",4.5,"  kevin heart stoll the show"
"556",4,"  Not as good as the original movie, but very emtertaining and with a lot of the spirit of the first Jumanji and with a very good humor and beautiful action scenes."
"557",4,"  This was awesome. A reboot I could really get behind. See it"
"558",5,"  well acted directed and funny with good moments of emotional content too seen it 6 times and will probably see it a few more"
"559",3,"  It's hard to beat the original. This had a completely different atmosphere. It's more like Tomb Raider."
"560",5,"  It's rare when a sequel tops the original"
"561",3,"  Dwayne J. y Kevin Hart es una de las mejores parejas actuales de comedia pero la pelicula no se tuvo que haber centrado en eso.Fue interesante a ratos."
"562",4.5,"  One of my absolute favorites of 2017.Amazing movie that will become it's own classic."
"563",5,"  Dwayne Johnson does a phenomenal job playing Spencer & Jack Black playing Bethany."
"564",3,"  predictable, occasionally funny"
"565",3,"  Mostly painless; national comedic treasure Jack Black gives everything he's got to help elevate more than a few scenes."
"566",3,"  I really enjoy the movie have quite a lot of funny moments. Was good for a Sunday movie."
"567",4,"  Jumanji is an adequate blockbuster that takes its time in developing the protagonists, introducing and overcoming internal struggles, and teaching each character a lesson in the process. Each star plays as an insecure high school teenager, who, now in a video game, has been provided with super powers to take on menacing threats that are far worse than anything they had encountered before in the real world. The cast does a hilarious job playing as stereotypical teenagers, most notably Jack Black, who plays as an Instagram-obsessed valley girl in a performance that makes him feel exactly like the same girl we are presented with in the beginning of the movie. On the other end, Kevin Hart, where he did provide the kind of humor that he normally presents in any of his other comedies, didn't feel like the same character that he's supposed to be playing from the onset of the film. Karen Gillan and Dwayne Johnson are both marvelous at playing shy characters with a romance between them, and that is set up and executed in a style that many action movies have gone by over the years, only this was one of the few that put a smile on my face by the end of the movie. Go check out the movie while it's still in theaters, it's full of humorous performances and a simple story that will leave any audience member satisfied."
"568",4.5,"  Ridiculously entertaining. Worth seeing just for Jack Black's performance. I was concerned this would be a remake which couldnt possibly live up to the original. Fortunately, they came up with an entirely new story based on the Jumanji concept. Went with a group of 13, ages 7- almost 70, and everyone loved it."
"569",3,"  Overall this movie is very fun, but there are a lot of below the belt gender jokes that I wasn't too fond of. It also doesn't have the heart of the original. The video game twist was a fun idea on how to make it more modern, but they were able to figure out the premise too quickly when it wasn't a board game. Even though it felt a bit predictable to me and Karen Gillan seemed really uncomfortable in her costume I did still enjoy watching The Rock run around in the jungle."
"570",4.5,"  Its the Rock in a goofy adventure movie! Jack black does these cringing bits, that only he can pull off. Kevin Hart is damn funny and Karen Gillan is the eye candy... This was a well written and fun movie!"
"571",4.5,"  Funny and entertaining"
"572",1,"  terrible ..this movie was utter garbage..the mystical board game degenerated into a video game.Raping our childhoods with these silly sequel reboots. Jumanji becomes another victim and the Sheeple love itI could care less if I ever see these 3 actors in another movie.."
"573",3,"  A bit cringe-worthy and cliche at times. It didn't live up to the first one and they try to make up for that through special effects and jokes. This could've gone from a decent movie to a great movie if they had worked through the story more. It felt like the story was lacking throughout. The ending could've been better too."
"574",4,"  Enjoyable movie with a splash ok romance, comedy, and mainly adventure"
"575",3.5,"  A fun and new life added to a movie that we only remembered from Robin Williams's line, ""Run! It's a Stampede."" The actors portrayal of characters unlike themselves helps enthrall the audience. The movie was enjoyable, though the entire premise was poorly constructed. However, that is not why I went to see the movie so I was pleased with the outcome."
"576",0.5,"  Another stupid The Rock movie. Sad that the Jumanji name part of this movie, the real Jumanji is a classic!"
"577",5,"  This movie reviews the classic parts from the original movie and still find?s a way to be original in this wonderful classic Jumanji. It is an all ages movie where you will find yourself in laughter by the amazing performance of Kevin Hart! The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) is fantastically acted in this action packed movie. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat through your the whole movie of all it?s vivid events! It is made to be enjoyed!"
"578",5,"  I loved these characters. Freaking hilarious."
"579",5,"  Funny movie. That's all we needed from it and we got it. Would be great to see this movie R-rated."
"580",5,"  Súper graciosa, muy buena"
"581",5,"  GO see this. I loved it. ??"
"582",5,"  It's fun, fun, fun. The acting is good, the story is good, it's pure entertainment. God bless Robin Williams but this one is better. And I've missed you Amy Pond!"
"583",3.5,"  Escapist family fare that benefits from a likeable cast and a fun concept."
"584",3.5,"  Using the standard set by the first Jumanji, this film was very good. It adopted a modern look of the classic story but with a fresh and overall funny attitude. Now, this is not Oscar nomination material, but you should not be expecting that."
"585",4,"  One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Jack Black is a more convincing highschool girl than most teenage girl actors. Dwayne Johnson delivers a surprisingly strong and self-aware performance, and Kevin Hart is being Kevin Hart so if you like him in anything else you'll like him here. The movie does a great job of unashamedly including every action movie trope every and making it very obvious it was done on purpose. It's campy, it's fun, it's got a surprising amount of character and charm to it, and it's just a joy to watch.My two gripes are that I wish they played up the video game theme just a little more. It kind of fades in and out of focus during the movie. Sometimes, it's obvious and fun and you can tell the writers have played old-school action games like Tomb Raider. Other times the movie kind of forgets, especially when the focus shifts to the characters. Also, the CGI is a bit below 2018 expectations, and they missed a great opportunity to make a joke about bad graphics. Other than that, super fun movie. Not the most groundbreaking movie, but just a good time for all."
"586",4.5,"  Everyone in the family found something to love about this movie. Hilarious, great acting, excellent expansion of the franchise, and a touching ending. Loved it!"
"587",5,"  Karen was amazing, so happy for her & owning her character Ruby Roudhouse :D"
"588",5,"  Fantastic, light hearted fast moving with just the right amount of laughs added in"
"589",5,"  Jumanji was excellent, fingers crossed for a 3."
"590",4.5,"  Dwayne & Jack Black were great potraying their characters."
"591",5,"  Loved this movie, one of the best of 20 17."
"592",4.5,"  Interesting and fun!"
"593",4,"  Well, Dwayne Johnson was a great choice to act Spencer in the Jumanji World. The cast was really awesome too ."
"594",3.5,"  I liked this movie, but probably not as much as others. I feel like I knew what was going to happen before it happened, However, I was entertained and enjoyed the laughs this movie offered. :)"
"595",3.5,"  The trailer had the best parts. But still I enjoyed it. It was a good upgrade from the original to modernize it. The cast is great and everyone is fantastic. My favorite is still Jack Black! He is hysterical. But I actually was impressed with Jonas."
"596",2.5,"  Slow, slower, slowest. OK itÂ´s beautifully evocative of the 1980s. Summer in Italy. Apricots. Lots of swimming_ Will Elio go for the girl Mazia, or the creep Oliver. It takes a lot of deciding ' a lot of shots of Elio in his shorts (the same ones - he has a limited range of underwear) Anyway Oliver doesn't deserve him. By the time we get to the end we have lost the will to live and no number of bike rides will do..."
"597",4,"  Enjoyable film with a fresh spin off the original."
"598",3,"  I truly don't know how the rock keeps putting his money that are not brilliantly acted or produced but just entertaining enough to keep coming back to his films for some reason. (outside F&F franchise). The real teens simply can be cut out of the movie since its poorly acted anyways, but the in-game stuff is where the cringe stops (most of the time)."
"599",5,"  Loved it! Fun from start to finish."
"600",3.5,"  Very enjoyable film. Laughs at every turn and solid performances turned in by The Rock and company. For me a definite buy on Blu-Ray"
"601",3.5,"  It was a fun film to watch overall. While it wasn't anything special and the some of the characters themselves felt kind of bland, I'm still glad this movie was made and had a blast seeing Kevin hart and the rock on the big screen again"
"602",5,"  The movie was hilarious and well made. A little too adult for children but enjoyable for the audience who grew up on the original."
"603",4.5,"  Puts you in the mind of a classic adventure type film. RPG gamers are going to love it."
"604",4.5,"  funny action packed movie that does justice to the first movie"
"605",3.5,"  The movie was quite a fun with family and kids. Its been a long from last one but they have maintained the thrill in it."
"606",5,"  Bust a gut end to end laughter HIGHLY reccomend"
"607",4,"  Thought it was going to be another soft reboot but was greatly pleased with the outcome. As fun as a jumanji movie can get and the actor's delivery was on point."
"608",5,"  Tons of fun and laughs!"
"609",5,"  love love freaking loved it!"
"610",5,"  Hilarious! Great Cast! Great Dialogue! Loved it!!"
"611",3.5,"  Was a fan of the original and thought I'd hate the new version but was pleasantly surprised."
"612",5,"  Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Hart make a damn fine duo"
"613",4,"  I would've really loved it had I not already seen the whole thing including all the jokes in trailer. It's good."
"614",4.5,"  Good writing, good acting, nice effects, just an overall fun and entertaining movie."
"615",5,"  Got to go see this with my daughter 2 weeks early with Amazon early access and I tell you it was amazing... Not only was it a great comedy but it had so many layers ... It touched on everything friendships, not fitting in, and so many things ... It has easily become one of our favorite movies and have since seen it with my other daughter and two of my friends.... Go see this movie ... And laugh you butt off"
"616",4.5,"  Saw the new Jumanji today & it was actually pretty damn good! Intended for an entire family audience than the last, had some good self-aware jokes."
"617",4.5,"  A very fun moviegoing experience that leaves audiences satisfied after modernizing the original premise it was based on, as well as providing ample time for Jack Black to comment on his anatomy."
"618",5,"  I loved this movie and can't wait to buy it on blu-ray"
"619",5,"  Simply put, one of the best films of the year. 9/10"
"620",3,"  Pretty dumb but still entertaining I guess."
"621",4.5,"  Lots of fun! ð~ Ã°~ Ã°~"
"622",2.5,"  There's some fun to be had but it was a rather forgettable time."
"623",0.5,"  Yesterday I saw Jumanji with a friend.We left after one hour. I could not bear it any longer.That movie is the worst I have seen in a very long time. Normally that's not a reason to post something on instagram, but I want to tell you what is so awful about that movie.It is full of prejudices and stereotypes. A few examples after the ""plot"": There are four teenagers who get sucked into the game Jumanji. By getting sucked into the game they also receive the bodies an abilities of the game characters.One of those teenagers is black. At first, he is a rather cool guy, but bad in school. First shit: why has the black guy to perform bad in school? Second shit: When he is finally transformed into the character he changes from the cool guy into the dumb guy, the one people laugh about. He becomes the joke of the group. And he acts like so many other black joke characters in US-American movies: He is short tempered and clumsy. Why always the black guy? I mean really: Why does it always have to be the black guy who is the clumsy sidekick of the main hero (who is most of the time white)?Third shit: One girl happens to be the smart one who does not want to participate in gym class and is rather shy. When she is transformed she becomes a sexy killer machine who later has to flirt with some guys in the game to distract them. Another girl (now transformed into a chubby man) teaches the sexy killer machine how to flirt with guys in general, because the smart one has never done it and does not know how. Why does the smart girl needs to be taught by the ""cool and pretty"" girl (now the chubby guy) how to flirt with guys? I don't get it. She is good looking and very intelligent, she will get a man (if she wants to) not by knowing how to flirt with dumb-ass guys who only want to f*** you/her but by being amazing. Why is it presented in this movie as if the ability to flirt with guys is necessary for girls/women?The story itself is crap, too. I cannot recommend the movie at all and I am so looking forward for the humanistic and feminist revolution which is so long overdue for all of us: women, men, people of colour (why is the colour even still an issue?), people with different sexualities and so on and so on.I'm so sick of all that chauvinistic, racist, homophobic etc. bullshit and nonsense!!!!!"
"624",4,"  Surprisingly very good. Funny, different than the original, and I think better than the original. Some life lessons in there too for kids about friendships. Some language, but mainly great."
"625",4.5,"  Jack Black puts his comedic presence back on the map. The Rock and Kevin Hart are highly entertaining as usual. However, Nick Jonas almost stole the show with impressive character development in a minor role."
"626",4,"  Really liked it. Southland w/Shawn, R&JWould re-watch"
"627",3.5,"  It's exactly what you would expect from a movie with Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black. It's funny and fun, but don't expect the actors to stretch to play their characters. It's the Rock in the jungle, wiith Kevin Hart making constant short jokes and comments about his inadequacies, while Jack Black plays an off the wall diva."
"628",4,"  This film is a hilarious and fun twist on the original...Jack Black is the stand out, but the whole cast commits and it works"
"629",5,"  It was great to find a movie that all three of my kids could get into even though one typically likes cartoons, one is a ""tween"" and wants characters, and the other is fifteen and often disinterested in films. I was thrilled that this wasn't the same as the original and jokes about the new generation on their cell phones in class had me laughing."
"630",5,"  I loved this movie and really want to go see it again!!!"
"631",5,"  In a world where a lot of sequels fail, Jumanji succeeds thanks to the amazing cast"
"632",5,"  This is by far my favorite Jumanji. The one with Robin Williams use to be my favorite before I saw this, so many laughs... my favorite was Bethany played by jack black..he is always phenomenal"
"633",4.5,"  Not really a fan of Kevin Harts shitck but Jumanji was a great film nonetheless & you can tell the cast had a lot of fun playing their characters."
"634",4.5,"  Loved Karen Gillan & Dwayne Johnson in this film. They really brought the action and a lot of humor."
"635",4,"  Finally got round to watching Jumanji, it was actually very funny.Long live the Dwayne Johnson x Kevin Hart formula."
"636",5,"  It was nice to see a different take on the movie I enjoyed watching. It was hilarious and kept me entertained."
"637",4.5,"  This was an AMAZING watch & a pretty good sequel to the original. After dreading watching it, I finally saw it with some friends and it was really enjoyable. Kooky at places, but just enough. Would recommend to anyone who has seen the original."
"638",5,"  Highly recommend ! it was hilarious"
"639",2.5,"  Oddly enough, The Rock's most personal movie."
"640",2,"  Just awful. The movie just didn't spellbound you in its story and scenes as the original. The movie just slightly works due to its nonsensical humor"
"641",4,"  Great movie. I was skeptical that they could pull off a part 2 this much later and make it work and be relevant to life then and now. It's quite funny but also touches on some topics of self image that every high schooler should hear."
"642",3,"  This is a very funny movie, to stay watching when one zaps"
"643",3.5,"  Had some good laughs"
"644",5,"  Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a really good movie way better then expected. It had good humor and the story was also really well done, it is worth watching"
"645",4,"  Jumanji was really fun and had enough things that were nostalgic but a lot of new things that are a new and exciting.  Dwayne the rock johnson and Kevin Hart were all great. If they make a sequel, I hope they put enough care into like they did this with this movie."
"646",4,"  This looked like it might be a movie that showed all of the best parts in the trailers, and that was not the case at all. We really enjoyed it."
"647",3,"  It was an alright movie and pretty funny actually ! I really expected the film to be completely trash but I was wrong"
"648",4.5,"  If we don't talk about the old version of Jumanji, This it the best Jumanji movie for me"
"649",3.5,"  what's there to say, it's an action movie revival of jumanji with the rock. that being said, it plays as an action movie with the rock."
"650",4,"  Quite funny and actually better than expected, even the first one!"
"651",3,"  Yet another testament to the growing Hollywood trend of remakes, sequels, and reboots that only encapsulate a shell of what their predecessors represented. Instead of the tender musings on childhood, adulthood, time, and fear that the original possessed, we get some recycled thematics that you can find in any 80's high school flick. Instead of the smart and effective humor that made the original film so entertaining, we get dick jokes. It simply doesn't even flick a booger in the direction of the original. . .but it's still watchable. Yes, even I'll admit - though I wasn't looking forward to this flick at all (and although I still ended up not even liking it that much) it ended up containing a bit more competency than I was expecting. The video-game-isms are entertaining, the lead performances are definitely stimulating, and even though there are still some glaring, fundamental issues with it, ""Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle"" is still somehow worth the watch."
"652",3.5,"  This movie is way better than I thought it would be. It was pretty funny. But it was also pretty cliche. Overall not a bad movie. Pretty enjoyable."
"653",3,"  Ok, this movie will not win any major awards but what it will do is entertain you to no end. Funny, clever, well written, and the onscreen chemistry between all the actors is just superb. Go see it if you want a silly, fun night out and away from your problems. You will laugh and cheer and be glad you saw it ... unlike Star Wars The Last Jedi -- once that abomination is seen it cannot be unseen."
"654",4.5,"  great funny movie, one that I could watch over and over. Great choice of characters and cast."
"655",2,"  Ridiculously sexist outfit for Karen, and of course her first talent is to be a sexual distraction to the enemy. Her dance fighting took forever compared to her male counterpart."
"656",4,"  Jack Black does scary accurate impressions of a 15 year old girl."
"657",4,"  Solid 4 stars for this movie - I was sold when I found out The Rock and Jack Black were cast :) Totally awesome premise, how they went in and came back out as totally different people. I also really liked the action involved and the way they played in the original movie. It was not just a reboot, it was a whole new movie."
"658",3,"  Good balance of humour with its kid friendly action, but plays it a little too safe in my eyes. I felt the story could have done with been up a level from PG."
"659",5,"  Never seen people Laugh out Loud in Cinema like they did in Junmaji 2. The movie is so fun to watch specially for gamers. I enjoyed every minute of it , spectacular movie, beautifully made and a must see."
"660",4,"  Enjoyable, I see little flaw in it. The good fun the main cast brings is welcome. It's not much more than that though - Good Fun."
"661",5,"  Great movie, great ending! Nice acting, good plot, great action scenes & hilarious moments."
"662",5,"  Great movie! It's HILARIOUS and I feel that it is the best comedy of the year hands down. This is a must watch, I loved it so much I'm buying it when it comes out!"
"663",5,"  É uma comÃ©dia leve, e eles nÃ£o tentaram imitar aspectos do outro filme o tempo inteiro, acho que trouxe um novo ar para o filme. Muito bom."
"664",3.5,"  Better than I thought it'd be!"
"665",5,"  Saw it and loved it. Fun movie! I love The Rock, however Jack Black steals scene after scene! My 2 cents."
"666",4,"  I did not expect the movie to be so charming and fun, but it was - especially for all us old school RPG players. I laughed out loud several times and would definitely recommend it!"
"667",4.5,"  Fun, fun , fun! Awesome acting, hilarious, cool sets and costumes, and modern CGI. Very entertaining for any age and gender."
"668",5,"  20+ years from now, this will be a classic of it's own. Great cast"
"669",4,"  Better than original"
"670",4.5,"  Apart from Kevin Hart, you really by the cast as their characters. Really good acting and great chemistry between the cast."
"671",5,"  Dwayne The Rock Johnson is awesome. Bonafide leading man."
"672",3,"  Not bad but not nearly as memorable as the original."
"673",3,"  Entertaining and fun."
"674",5,"  I really liked this movie, good balance of comedy & Action Jack Black is the true star of this movie not Dwayne Johnson"
"675",5,"  Pretty good movie! Really interesting and amazing!"
"676",4,"  It distances itself enough to not be a remake of the original film. I love the direction that they took with this story. I also think the casting was perfect. Everyone involved were absolutely born for these roles."
"677",4,"  THIS MOVIE IS FUCKING HILARIOUS! Seen it twice..."
"678",4.5,"  THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC !! wooo"
"679",3.5,"  (3 1/2 Stars)Hollywood's current M:O of rebooting long deceased franchises or even creating sequels and/or prequels to past films we also thought buried and gone continues to be hit or miss. While Jumanji's story was never a movie I predicted needed anymore of Hollywood's touch, I suppose I wasn't as shocked to see them get the treatment after nearly 22 years from the original. Go ahead and throw together a stellar cast of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan...you may color me intrigued.Welcome to the Jungle doesn't offer the experience the original did. In fact, I'm kind of glad they stayed away from mimicking any of the 1995 version outside of some callbacks and well-placed easter eggs. The original was built on a brand new story and included a fear factor intent on actually scaring you but not to the point of outright horror. But this time, we get full on family fun entertainment. This movie may have been PG-13, but you could have just as easily tagged it PG if only it weren't for the 'deaths' and 'violence' some of characters incur in a video-game-like environment.As was expected, the movie doesn't really kick off until the four students are sucked into the game. None of the teenagers give off a particularly strong vibe of carrying a film, which is why it's left to the big stars like the four I mentioned above. *side note* I'm not sure if it's going to be left open-ended or explained as to how the board game turned into a video game system other than, poof, overnight, but I'm fine if we never learn the true origin of Jumanji. Then again, watch another follow-up film surface in a few years time due to the financial success of this one.Most of the laughs come in the form of self-deprecating humor because of the physical transformations each actor goes through when they convert from their real-life selves into the avatars of the game. Surprisingly, the Rock's and Gillan's characters are too straightforward to really elicit big laughs outside of seeing Johnson act like an elephant every time he sees a mouse. The real laughs come in the form of Hart and Black, who essentially character swap, with Black earning top honors for being inhabited by a 16-yr-old girl. Terrific fun. Unfortunately, this sequel doesn't quite leap past any film from 2017 due to the basic, kid-friendly premise. This one is more about learning who you are or finding one's true self rather than giving us an real threat to our characters. The lesson was clearly more important than the plot.While we were able to see the flip side of the coin Robin Williams character endured in the original, it kept things to the tamest of the checked boxes for a PG-13 rating. This version won't have any parents dragging their children out of the theater like the original may have had, but it'll certainly continue to keep butts in seats through the early months of 2018 as good, light-hearted fun with some solid acting performances even if the entire ordeal was too cheesy."
"680",5,"  My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. So fun!"
"681",5,"  an amzing third film in the franchise loved it"
"682",3,"  It doesn't really feel like a sequel to the first one, but it's funny enough to be entertaining for most of its duration."
"683",2,"  Although this had a few moments, I'm only giving this movie 2 stars because of the charming cast that works well together and the fact that Jack Black was great as a teenage girl. Otherwise I am just not at all a fan of movies that are based on games & this one was no different. The story was weak and the character development, especially for the bad guy was thin to non existent. I know this movie is huge and I hate to be the Debbie Downer, but this movie was just mindless entertainment with a thin story."
"684",4,"  A successful and updated sequel, some really humorous moments thanks to Jack Black, and an exciting plot at its core."
"685",5,"  Really fun movie! Lots of laughs, plenty of action and just enough plot to hold it together. Enjoy."
"686",5,"  This movie was amazing ????"
"687",5,"  You can't compare this one to the original Jumanji. This was a comedy! I loved it"
"688",3.5,"  Humorous story line, yet full off adventure."
"689",5,"  It's better when you are drunk"
"690",4.5,"  WOW! This movie was SOOOOO much fun! The action scenes were great, and the acting was also great. I'm having trouble telling who the best actor was. It's definitely between Kevin Hart and Jack Black. Jack Black played a high school girl, and it surprisingly worked! The humor is just great! If you love action movies see this one. Heck, I haven't seen the first Jumanji movie, so you don't need to watch that to know what's going on."
"691",4,"  A sequel that's as good as the original Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a direct sequel to Jumanji (1995) which slightly changes the ending of that film and leads directly into this film. This time Jumanji has turned into a video game (for reasons I won't spoil here) and in the year 2016 four teenagers: Spencer (Alex Wolff) a nerd, Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) the jock, Bethany (Madison Iseman) the blonde, and then Martha (Morgan Turner) the rebellious smart chick. All four don't exactly get along and soon find the video game while in detention. The four transport into the video game becoming their avatars that they chose on the screen. Spencer has become Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) a man with no fear and as strong as an ox, Fridge has become Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart) a zoologist that has a weakness to cake, Bethany is Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black) a cartographer...and also a guy, then Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a bad ass fighter. The four of them find out they must return a jewel to a statue to defeat the curse of the game and then they can go home. The kids have to learn who they truly are and work together in order to survive or die in the game forever! The movie has some great action sequences and has a lot of funny moments. The movie obviously focuses on the avatars themselves and not exactly the kids which works here because they obviously carry the film a lot better. The difference here is that it's funny seeing someone like the Rock acting like a kid that is worried all the time and Jack Black as a girl in a mans body. It's a great sequel with a good message about being the person you can really be. Overall, solid film that's doing incredibly well, so I don't exactly have to recommend it since I'm the one behind on catching it!"
"692",4,"  Very interesting along with a few laughs."
"693",1,"  Stereotypes and actors playing against type make for a shallow, fun film. Nice action sequences, uninter3esting characters."
"694",4,"  An Incredibly fun flick for all to enjoy."
"695",5,"  Its really good but wont beat the original the layout its good"
"696",4,"  Good movie if you like games your love this one 8/10"
"697",4,"  If you don't think too much about this movie, it can actually be really fun"
"698",5,"  I personally loved this movie just as much as the original movie."
"699",3,"  Average. Most of the storyline is very predictable. The original movie is the best thou."
"700",4.5,"  Why did everyone think this film was doomed to fail?"
"701",5,"  Funny as hell. Great family movie. Was not excited when I found out that this movie was being remade, but the entire movie was as funny as the trailer. Will definitely buy it when it comes out."
"702",3.5,"  Funny and cute. people like video game would like this theme."
"703",4,"  Funny and cute. People like video game would be appreciated."
"704",3,"  There are worse ways to spend your time-Dickey Sauce"
"705",0.5,"  Casi me duermo, 2 VECES, obviando el fino humor de contadas escenas, es demasiado obvio el hambre de taquilla y la abstención de bases cinematogrÃ¡ficas solidas, una decepciÃ³n"
"706",4,"  The new Jumanji is an extremely funny sequel to the original and you will be laughing for most of the time. The story about a group of high school kids in detention finding a video game consul and being sucked into it is quite enjoyable and entertaining to watch. The whole cast is absolutely hilarious and the one thing we all like to see most is Jack Black's character being a teenage girl in real life."
"707",5,"  Fun movie. Cast chemistry was great. You can tell they must have enjoyed working with one another. One of those movies that surprises you and is better than expected. Very rare that I prefer a sequel--especially one so removed in time from the original--more than the original. Yet, here is a fun, funny and charming sequel that is definitely worth watching."
"708",3,"  Divertida en ocasiones pero la trama fue muy corta"
"709",3.5,"  Really enjoyed this movie! Jack Black completely goes for it and is amazing in this role. It pokes fun at video game stereotypes and its great to see Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Heart working together again; their chemistry and comedic timing is amazing! My only criticism is that it starts to drag towards the end and felt long. I checked my watch a few times to see how much time was left."
"710",4,"  Filled with fun and exciting action with suspense of the plot."
"711",3.5,"  Para empezar, la pelÃ­cula poco tiene que ver con la origina; Sin embargo, los personajes y su desarrollo dentro de la pelÃ­cula logra envolverte sin dejar de ser una comedia simplona."
"712",3,"  Was a happy, funny film to watch yet had some very weak moments that were poorly acted."
"713",3.5,"  Clever formula that will keep you interested and in the end might move you. Jack Black and Kevin Hart make the movie."
"714",4.5,"  Didn't expect this movie to actually be good! It was better than good though. Almost great"
"715",3.5,"  This movie is NOT a reboot, as originally thought. It is a sequel - and a pretty good one too. Jack Blacks performance for his character was really impressive! Cameo appearance by Colin Hanks"
"716",3,"  This film will by no means win any awards, but it was none the less a pleasant distraction from the current real world toxic political climate. I enjoyed it for what it is and personally believe it to be better than the original."
"717",5,"  Better than the original in terms of pure entertainment. So much is different between the first and second movies it's almost irrelevant to call it a sequel. Plenty for adults and kids alike. A great family movie for families can cope with a few sexually suggestive scenes without to much discomfort."
"718",5,"  ??? ????? ?? ????? ?????, ??????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ???????."
"719",5,"  Brilliant Show even better than the original Very Funny"
"720",3.5,"  Breakfast Club detention premise infuses a jolt of fun into the Jumanji brand with a clever construct bridging the avatar/real world divide. Acting surpassed expectations across the board, it was evident they had a lot of fun making this film. More suitable for late teens and the college crowd, older parents may find the laughs sporadic. A firm dose of nostalgia for those who enjoyed role playing video games in the late 1980's. Some positive messages for the younger generation about working together on arduous ventures. Overall it is a pleasantly enjoyable experience."
"721",3.5,"  A great ensemble and self awareness make for a fun ride. 82/100"
"722",3,"  I give this an 84/B."
"723",5,"  bkjhefkhaskjhskjdfhs"
"724",5,"  Movie was awesome. Will surely buy it on blu-ray. Whole family had a great time. I feel like 20 yrs from now it will be it's own classic."
"725",5,"  Laugh out loud funny!"
"726",3.5,"  The film had likable characters and a cast with great chemistry, although Jack Black's scenes were surprisingly overshadowed by Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. The film wasn't anything ground shaking, but was an enjoyable, light-hearted film"
"727",5,"  Loved this movie, so did my kids"
"728",5,"  It was quite clever of the writers to show the intelligence of the game had evolved from just capturing the player's inquisitive nature of the board game and turn it into a modern day video game which was more likely to peak the player's interest. The storyline followed the same entrapment theme as the original movie and incorporated the 1st films remnants which was inspired. My son and his friends absolutely loved it. Thumps up!!"
"729",5,"  It was fun to watch. But Jumanji 1 was the best"
"730",5,"  Really good film! Recommended!"
"731",0.5,"  This ruined my childhood and also robin williams is dead they pretended he was never there"
"732",5,"  That was sooo much fun, especially in the 4DX seats!!"
"733",3,"  It's nothing like the first Jumanji but it's very funny and very well presented."
"734",4.5,"  Well done. Smart, hysterically funny, good story plot, great characters. I want to see it again."
"735",4,"  It was fun and clever. I really liked it."
"736",4,"  I always go back and forth on remakes or ""re-imaginings"" (whatever that means) of classic movies-and unfortunately for most of you reading this column, that word ""classic"" in Hollywood refers to any movie made before the year 2000-but sometimes a cool concept can be freshened up without losing its appeal. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle strikes a good balance between staying true to the original children's book by Chris Van Allsburg (who also wrote The Polar Express, for those of you keeping score) and the new gadget-obsessed youth of the 21st century. Instead of a cool wooden board game with pieces and a nifty crystal ball that tells you about what's about to crash into your living room, this particular iteration is a console video game, which would ordinarily thrill any of us who owned an original Nintendo or Sega Genesis, but turns out to be a momentary distraction for four unlikely teens in a set-up that is borrowed straight out of The Breakfast Club. Only instead of some nostalgic, time-wasting gaming, they get sucked into the world of Jumanji where they are tasked with a mission before their lives are all used up.Whoever thought to team up Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson should get a raise, as they are really funny and fun together. Karen Gillian (Nebula from Guardians of the Galaxy) plays the super-hot and super dangerous Lara Croft-style jungle babe with appropriate disdain. But best of all, it's so nice seeing Jack Black be funny again. His selfie-obsessed mean girl winds up in the body of, well, Jack Black, and he makes the most of the material.The special effects are pretty special, as are the stunts and the action; Jumanji is no place for a quiet stroll. And while the plot is nothing complicated, the character interaction and the great performances from the cast make this film a must-see in the theater, where you can appreciate the magical world of Jumanji with other people. Older kids and Generation X Parents in particular will appreciate the mashups in the movie."
"737",3.5,"  Surprising because it is such fun. Robin Williams' legacy is kept intact by the comedy stylings of a strong cast. I went to the film as a matinee to kill time while waiting to pick up a friend. The audience was small as one would expect on a weekday afternoon but the theater rang with our laughter. On top of this the films is, in many ways, a modern Aesop's fables with a ""moral to the story"" that I found particularly appealing....one is who one decides to be and gifts differing are made stronger in the cmpany of others of good will."
"738",4.5,"  Very, very funny even though a bit cheesy at times. But thoroughly enjoyed it."
"739",4.5,"  Expectations weren't high, but this was a hoot! Great fun that I would do again."
"740",5,"  Jack Black played a really good version of a teenage girl and it was awesome to see that personality of him. He is almost like the next Robin Williams in a way of speaking"
"741",4,"  Fun movie, good actors, and a good plot. Mostly got what I expected, in a good way."
"742",3.5,"  Fun and entertaining!"
"743",3,"  The movie, unlike the JUMANJI, lacked the suspense and fear of being part of a game from where you will never return alive. It really funny for sure but easily forgettable one."
"744",5,"  Grab some popcorn, pizza, soda, sit back & enjoy this movie because it was awesome."
"745",4.5,"  This movie completely exceeded my expectations.I loved it"
"746",5,"  Fun movie to kill a few hours w/o having to think too much. Hilarious!"
"747",5,"  Absolutely loved this movie. Easily my favorite of the year."
"748",5,"  One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are a remarkable duo in movies. Jack Black just puts it over the tope. A definite Must See for anyone who wants to just laugh and enjoy a movie."
"749",5,"  I'm really, really excited to see this. Jack Black as a teenage girl = SO excited. Also a sentence that I never had predicted I'd say before. And I was just as pleased as I had expected! The chemistry between these five cast members is obvious, and Karen and Jack's flirt scenes--plus Kevin and Dwayne's funny lines--were absolutely hilarious for everyone in my family of all ages. Such a great movie, and I'll definitely be seeing it again! A sequel would be amazing if it still included this dynamite cast!"
"750",3.5,"  This was a fun twist of the original Jumanji board game we all know and love. The story is more modern by making the setting of the game virtual and inside of a video game. I highly recommend watching because it's the perfect balance of humor and action. Although I would say this is more of a comedy than anything else."
"751",4.5,"  An excellent follow on from the original with the late great RW RIP"
"752",1,"  Man this was crap.How it gets the good reviews is beyond me.The acting was terrible, actually too much over acting.Jack Black was wasted in this film as a transgender. Hart was pretty good and without him the movie would be really bad.The worst movie the Rock has ever done. He's actually getting worse with he's recent roles. Rock why are you becoming such a pussy and taking these bad roles? Now you're a baby next role if you get one with a tough/bad guy it's gonna be near impossible for you to be convincing again playing all these kiddie films. Bring back the Rock in faster.The film could have brought some great creatures to the movie since it's the jungle but the there were none except a couple of rino's and cats. Poor choice.Cinematography was poor as was lighting.Story was badly told from start to finish. Original is way better."
"753",4,"  This movie struck gold with the amazing dynamic of the cast. The Rock and Hart are just an amazing duo. They really benefited from eachother in Jumanji even more then in their previous movie Central Intelligence. But the biggest win for this movie is Jack Black. JACK FREAKIN BLACK. That delivers one of the funniest performances of 2017. He just nails this role as a 17 year old, selfie addicted girl. This movie really had one of the best chemistry of a cast this year. But the rest of the movie falls a little bit into the normal adventure/action movietropes. Which makes the movie forseeable. All in all it is a fun, light movie. Perfect for a movie night with friends."
"754",5,"  this movie is awesome haven't laugh that much in awhile"
"755",4,"  better than the original"
"756",5,"  Amazing! I went into this movie expecting it to be bad but I loved it; it was honestly hilarious. Everyone really meshed well together in the cast and the storyline was good. It was a fun movie!"
"757",4,"  Great fun movie with some good laughs."
"758",5,"  Great fun movie! Highly recommend! Nick Jonas did a great job for his first major movie."
"759",4.5,"  Great movie! They picked the perfect cast for this movie and it has a lot of laughs."
"760",3.5,"  For all of it's flaws, and there are plenty, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is entertaining, suspenseful, and funny enough to keep your attention. You don't need to have seen the original in order to enjoy the sequel, but you do have to take a pass at a few on the continuity errors. The Rock and Kevin Hart have a really fun chemistry, this is something everyone knows. Unfortunately, after the initial, few laughs Jack Black's character provides, his presence becomes distracting. Appropriate for teens and older, the action will draw in young and old alike. Let's give some props to The Rock. He's having fun here and it's fun watching him. I totally bought in to his being an awkward nerd. Karen Gillan is really good as well, and that's what makes the movie: the performances. I'm not looking forward to the third version, but then again I wasn't looking forward to this either. A really nice surprise. Final Score: 6.8/10"
"761",4,"  ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" exceeds expectations with a sequel that nobody asked for but yet becomes one of the most surprising movies to come out in 2017. You can see that the cast are having so much fun portraying teenagers. Jack Black steels the show portraying a teenage girl that misses her phone."
"762",4,"  A great remake and pretty funny. A brilliant cast really makes the film."
"763",1,"  nothing to see with the old jumanji!! its like ghostbuster ..... ruin classic movies with this re - makes. stop it !"
"764",1.5,"  Good story and would have been a good family movie it there wasn't so much talk about boys anatomy."
"765",3,"  Surprisingly or sadly, this movie just isn't fun, not a hollywood biggie.There were more humans than animals in the jungle. On the comedy front, only Kevin Hart kept a little laughs coming and Jack black, a totally wrong cast in the film. The Rock really didn't rock. Several of the action scenes really bored me and he was expressionless.The villain( did he look like one?) had absolutely no role in the story whatsoever and played no threat to the main characters.No actual thrill, adventure or danger with a story like this. Very much predictable .There was not a single part in the entire film that caught me off guard. It was a lame story line. Looked like the climax was also forced and hastily made. Good for a 12 yr old. An all right film for me. Nothing to rave about!!"
"766",4,"  A great popcorn flick with some good laughs. Unfortunately it didn't quite capture the dark foreboding feel of the original."
"767",5,"  Excellent film would of been better if it was a stand alone film instead of linking it back to the old jumanji"
"768",3.5,"  Parts of the movie were pretty funny, however there were a few parts that definitely felt like forced humor. Overall: Hart and Johnson were great together."
"769",4,"  4-stars for a movie that delivers exactly what you're looking to get.While the premise is simple and the outcome is expected, the acting is what really makes this an enjoyable film. And I'm not even a fan of The Rock, Jack Black or Kevin Hart.Jumanji the sequel loses the magic and wonder of the first movie, but is much funnier."
"770",4.5,"  This was actually a good fun entertaining sequel."
"771",4,"  Great Cast, hilarious movie! Was not expecting that at all"
"772",5,"  The most fun I have at a movie in a long time. Picks up where the old story left off but with a new twist."
"773",4,"  It's a fun movie. It won't change your life, but it should keep you amused while watching it."
"774",5,"  The rock is so cool and awesome"
"775",0.5,"  As a Christian I do not recommend this movie. A big disappointment , what was Dwayne Hohnsin thinking? Hollywood leave our children alone!!!!"
"776",5,"  Loved Jumanji. A lot better than the ghost busters reboot"
"777",4.5,"  super funny. My only issue was that the ending was pretty standard and predictable, but that was fine since the movie doesn't really take itself seriously and was more focused on making you laugh."
"778",5,"  Funny and entertaining... A great watch!"
"779",4.5,"  Extremely entertaining and hilarious. Much better than I expeced or that it had any right to be."
"780",4.5,"  Utterly Entertaining!"
"781",3,"  Entertaining family film. Nice chemistry between the cast. Think I like it more than the original 90s film."
"782",4,"  Jack Black steals the show, and it's a pretty fun show."
"783",4.5,"  Funny and entertaining"
"784",2,"  Forced adventure comedy completely unrelated to the original movie (just some little references). Has some good moments... not many. This comment might be affected by the fact that the movie only arrived in local language to my country, not original language"
"785",3.5,"  Lots of fun! Karen Gillan can suck my toes anytime!"
"786",2.5,"  A movie that doesn't add very much to it's source material, but is nonetheless a funny and entertaining movie with an interesting take on video games and an excellent jack black performance."
"787",4,"  Better than I have expected, lots of laughs with funny action. Recommend for lazy holidays."
"788",3.5,"  A heap of fun and laughs."
"789",3,"  Forgettable movie, memorable jokes"
"790",5,"  Best movie of all time I love it the 1st one was ok but ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" was amazing the best ever"
"791",2,"  This ""comedy"" offers very little when it comes to laughs. Most, if not all attempts at jokes fail miserably. If you're looking for a funny movie, this one is certainly not for you."
"792",2.5,"  The latest spin on a classic is certainly entertaining with some great jokes sprinkled throughout. The individual star powers of veteran comedians the Rock, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan, as well as their chemistry cannot be denied. But the entertainment value of Jumanji really stops there. Being a light-hearted comedy, Jumanji can't be faulted for its lack of character development or many plot holes. However, the supposed climax of the movie seemed extremely forced and hastily made. Jumanji will give you some good laughs, but it's not a movie you will be thinking about days after you watch it, or minutes"
"793",4,"  I liked this movie a lot. Is it predictable? Sure. Is it silly? Of course. But the cast of characters have a good interplay and the comic timing is great. Jack Black should make a career out of playing teenage girls. I didn't like the original, I thought it took itself far too seriously in spite of the fact that Robin Williams was the lead. This was different and stood alone for me."
"794",5,"  very enjoyable film. spent boxing day afternoon in the cinema watching this, very funny and enjoyable, which is what a film should be"
"795",4,"  good to see Jumanji back after a long gap!! it's a good movie fun to watch"
"796",4,"  I can't say much bad about this film. The contrast to the mess that was star wars was clear. All the characters did a sterling job, but Jack Black was in a league of his own. Simply wonderful acting. Madison Iseman was so hilarious as Bethany that I was very sad when I knew she wasn't going to be in the whole film. The film is funny, its engaging, the Rock is entertaining as ever, Kevin Hart is great. The game scenario with lives is a very nice idea and works well. The only negative things I would say is that the villain was unconvincing and perhaps unnecessary, Karen Gillan only really got one moment to shine (and for some reason didn't lose two lives), and the long cheesy ending was unnecessary. Still overall cohesive and they didn't overdo the CGI. Very good film."
"797",3.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is just what the world needed. The movie, while very fictitious and unbelievable in some parts, stays true to the original board game shown in the first Jumanji movie that featured Robin Williams. However, this movie added a modern spin, being shown as a Nintendo game console rather than the traditional board game.The acting was very good as well. Dwayne Johnson did a great job and turned around from a few mediocre performances - particularly Baywatch. This was also a good return by Jack Black, who hasn't been on the scene for a few years. He did a phenomenal job acting as a teenage girl. Kevin Hart did a good job as well as well. He was funny, almost trying too hard at times, and did a fine job being dramatic. Finally, Karen Gillen did a nice job as an innocent, hard-working student turned into a badass female who saved the crew multiple times.Overall, performed an exceptional feat: it followed up an original movie with an equal or better performance. The movie generates positive emotions and the ending, however confusing it may be, did a nice job wrapping up loose ends. The star studded cast did not disappoint this time."
"798",5,"  This movie was downright hilarious and entertaining!"
"799",4,"  It's such a funny stupid movie! ;)"
"800",5,"  My 12 year old son LOVES the original Jumanji so he had to go see this one. We went last night. He loved it, and I have to admit that I couldn't have enjoyed it more myself. Nothing was inappropriate for his age in my opinion, it was funny and the story was up to date. Very enjoyable.....5 stars!!!!"
"801",3.5,"  Fun movie but not appropriate for young children."
"802",5,"  Such a great movie with characters! Was really worth watching! Definitely gonna buy this one on blue ray"
"803",5,"  Well written screenplay, and well executed overall!"
"804",4,"  Just enough gimmick for everyone in the family to enjoy... funny, family-friendly adventure with a few animal laughs and a few lessons to follow. Grandparents bring the grandkids."
"805",5,"  I love this movie it is hilarious (even though I haven't seen it yet.Plus it has Kevin Hart in it"
"806",4,"  A perfect sequel. On another note.....Is the Rock in all movies?"
"807",4,"  This movie was action-packed, well-acted, and fun to watch in general, surpassing the original."
"808",4.5,"  Dwayne Johnson was one of the key standouts in this film. Jack Black & also Karen. They did a great job playing their characters."
"809",5,"  Great fun, comedy and action beats. Outweighed all expectations going in!"
"810",5,"  Amazing! Critics don't give it enough credit. They're probably too busy getting paid by disney to give TLJ 5 stars to actually enjoy it."
"811",2.5,"  Does it have funny moments? Sure. However Dwayne Th Rock Johnson once more manages to bring to the screen the same single layer character he has played in every single movie in the last couple of years. The movie does have some interesting things, but nothing to make it special."
"812",2,"  This was a halarious movie that the whole family enjoyed. It is so rare that my family can find a movie that we all agree on watching. This was overall an amazing movie."
"813",5,"  As far as action-comedies go, this is one of the best of all-time. The premise may be a bit silly (esp. if you never saw the original), but put that aside and you have a movie that is action-packed and full of laughs, without ever failing in either. One of the most entertaining times you can have in the theater!"
"814",4.5,"  A worthwhile comedy that was true to the format of the original. All the characters were well played with no real holes in the acting throughout. A good family film if you don't mind a few penis jokes. (they were biological)"
"815",4.5,"  this was part 2 thank goodness . so tired of remakes . I love the update from board game to video game. the game versions were choosen well. Kevin hart was actually funny in a movie . rock and jack black were convincely funny also. felt like i was playing the game with them. looking forward to a good part 2."
"816",5,"  Jumanji was a fun film to watch. A classic go to the theater, grab some food, and have a great couple of hours. The movie is very funny as there are quite a few occasions the whole audience was laughing."
"817",5,"  This was a great movie! My husband and I went to see it during our Christmas vacation. We had heard good things about it, but we were still surprised by how much we laughed out loud!"
"818",4.5,"  Muy divertido y entretenida"
"819",5,"  Good movie. Had a smile on my face from start to finish. As for the critics score. Movie wasn't liberal enough for them."
"820",4.5,"  Jumanji was no masterpiece, in fact it was panned by critics when it released. This sequel is a fun/entertaining adventure flick that keeps your focus with funny new exciting characters & is also very respectful of the 1995 version. It is standalone film that takes place in the world of Jumanji. One of THE best standalone sequels I've seen."
"821",3.5,"  Very, very good action comedy. Loved the concept of actors playing two different characters at ones. Jack Black as a teenage girl in a man's body was especially good. More emotional impact than you would expect. Could watch movies like this every day."
"822",4,"  I really thought this movie was going to be awful, however, I was shocked at how much fun I had at this movie."
"823",5,"  Haven't seen such a funny movie in a while suitable for families, teens as well as adults. The case did an excellent job and the visual effects are superb."
"824",0.5,"  This is a shame to late Robert Williams masterpiece Jumanji I really want my time and money back from watching this trash!"
"825",5,"  I thought I was going to hate this film. I thought that this film was going to ruin my experience with Robin Williams' classic original film but I was WRONG. This film was a fun ride from beginning to end, all the characters were funny and I thought that the direction they went with was perfect for a new generation of kids who'll then be curious to watch the original Jumanji. I thought that this was a faithful sequel and I would buy it on DVD / Blu-Ray."
"826",3,"  Trying my new Movie Pass out here..... this was an OK popcorn flick. The four main actors had really good chemistry, with Jack Black being the stand-out. There were some pretty funny moments too and more penis jokes than I was expecting. The Easter eggs from the original Jumanji were fun when they popped up, but this this definitely not a remaking or squeal. The villain was pretty bad.... you could literally edit him out and not even notice. The high school kids were super genetic and boring too. Overall, I would recommend if you have Movie Pass or if this ever comes out on Netflix...."
"827",4,"  Gives a 90s movie feel but equipped with modern visuals and effects. Jumanji gives delightful humor, well acting characters and a sufficient plot which make it one of the better comedy films of recent time"
"828",2.5,"  Surprisingly this film turned out better than I had predicted it to be. The previews showed most of the funny parts but there are plenty more in the film to keep interest going. I enjoyed the references to the original game plus Murray (present) from Flight of the Conchords is in this film, what could go wrong. The movie does have a lot of CGI and i've become kind of desensitized to it. The acting is about what you'd expect from the cast. Hart and Black are the comedians and they're on their game for the most part there's not much from the other cast, aside from the Rock who I swear is typecast. The story is ok, and it reminded me a lot of Uncharted (the video game series on PS3 and 4). The teen actors had a short part and that was ok because they were kind of throw away anyway. I may only be in my 30s but man kids these days are so spoiled rotten and vain. At least that's what this movie has you believe. The movie feels a bit too long in the tooth, as in I can guess wahs would be checking their watches during the last third of the film. It wasn't a bad film it just could have been better. That's why I gave it 2.5 stars out of 5."
"829",4,"  This movie was a nice homage to the genius Jumanji movie and a tribute to Robin Williams. I like it's relevance to modern day, but at points it gets confusing."
"830",5,"  I Liked the penis jokes??????"
"831",5,"  My wife and I found Jumanji to be a great movie. Action, Adventure, Story, and a boatload of humor. Definitely a case where I feel you need to go with the Audience Score rather than the 'Critic' score."
"832",3.5,"  Okay first with the bad: the villain is so absurd. He's supposed to be Van Pelt, and this is supposed to be a sequel; and yet these two couldn't be anymore different. He's just some gross edgelord.There are indeed severe cliches in the film. They aren't constant, but some really stand out. The romance especially; freaking skipping rocks and no subtly.However I still recommend the film. It is surprisingly good with its comedy, which I would not expect from remake/sequels. Both the character interaction and the chaos of the setting work incredibly well. And the action is also better; you can actually see what's going on and the editing is not trying to use BS cuts and blurs."
"833",4.5,"  In short: I liked it much more than 'Last Jedi.'This movie does what it does. It's based on a franchise and it's unique. It's cliche and new. Most of all it's enjoyable and goes about its business effectively. It's easily the best of this winter's big budget movies."
"834",3,"  I kinda loved it? I mean, nothing can top the original movie (nostalgia is a helluva drug), but this was fun and fresh in a different kinda way. Jack Black absolutely steals this riot of a movie. While I wish they would have honored Robin Williams in some way throughout the film (not even a mention? Binch please.), everyone brought their A-game and the ride was a blast. One other quick note: Nick Jonas, stick to making forgettable pop music. You suck in front of a camera."
"835",4,"  This is one of the sequels we've gotten this year (along with John Wick 2 and Blade Runner 2049) that might be better than the original. Great cast, interesting plot/premise, even supporting cast members like Rhys Darby and Nick Jonas (to my surprise) had some laughs. The only main problem I would have to say effects the movie would be the way Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan portray their kids. Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black have a lot of fun with the characters that their given, especially when Black has to interpret a stereotypical teenage girl, but Hart and GIllan seem to be almost completely different characters once we see them in the game."
"836",3.5,"  It was a funny and an interesting film to watch, the mixture of action, drama, and comedy blends in perfectly, we get to see more new discoveries in the game than its 1995 counterpart, I came out of the Theaters satisfied"
"837",4,"  funny and creative take on a video game movie"
"838",4.5,"  so fresh that it actually could have been a complete new story, very funny. My family loved it!"
"839",4,"  I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it, but Jumanji was actually pretty good."
"840",4.5,"  I was one of those ppl who doubted this movie when the trailers release. I will never judge a movie before seeing it again because this is one of my favorite fantasy/adventure movies now."
"841",5,"  It was hilarious and fun! Loved how everything wrapped up, and it gave a nice message."
"842",4,"  Despite a few critics disliking this movie, I actually enjoyed Jumanji a lot. I liked the characters, I liked the story, and the jokes. This is definitely one of the better movies in 2017."
"843",3.5,"  Not bad, Hollywood. Not bad. I must admit. I was very against this movie when I first heard about it. I was a fan in childhood of the original, and I only went to the film when I heard good things about it through word-of-mouth. I think the high point of the film was they found a way to pay homage to the original, but make it their own. Also, they actually delved into some character before diving into the plot which is an old storytelling trope not seen much anymore. Unfortunately, the strongest arc was not the lead character, but of Bethany's. They delved with the vague ""friendship"" in other areas which is weaker. And, another weakness is adult actors in the film plays their typical role and brings nothing new to their performances here. Are The Rock and Kevin Hart one trick ponies?I'll keep the word of mouth going. It was good. I recommend."
"844",5,"  Actually very funny! LOVE how they tied in the first Jumanji!"
"845",4.5,"  I liked the film a lot. One of the funniest movies in years! Loved Karen and Dwayne Johnson."
"846",4,"  Solid fun with some great acting and homages to original film. Laugh out loud moments and cared about the journey of each character."
"847",5,"  Great chemistry between Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Hart. Also Dwayne & Karen Gillan. Jack Black & Karen Gillan. Even the Jonas brother does a pretty good job."
"848",4.5,"  Jumanji was hilarious! & action-packed. Well worth the trip to the movies on this friday night."
"849",4.5,"  Really funny, pure enternainment, movie didnt take itself so serious. Pure <3"
"850",5,"  loved the movie, excellent writing!!!!"
"851",5,"  Fabulous family fun. Actors not afraid to take the tip out of themselves and a smouldering Rock is the icing on thev proverbial cake. Wonderfully reminiscent of 80's movies - big fun movies without smutty jokes or questionable language. no wonder its been a hit. The only remaining question is - when do they make another one?"
"852",3,"  Jumanjii is suppose to be a fun, action flick that espouses family-friendly morals. To this end, it largely succeeds. However, I don't know if I just miss the performance of Robin Williams, but this sequel does not seem to have the heart, that made the original unique. By painting the main characters with broad strokes, the writers lost an opportunity to really turn a 3-star movie into a four-star classic. In any case, it is fun, but not very clever. The kids will like it."
"853",5,"  It was awesome hearing jumanji being the biggest movie seller ....definitely an awesome movie ...congrats to the amazing cast"
"854",4.5,"  Jumanji is best film I've ever seen so far this year. I would so watch it over and over again. The Rock, Karen Gillan, & Jack Black were hilarious."
"855",5,"  Jumanji was far more entertaining than Star Wars."
"856",3,"  Harmless fun - you can see it with your kids without being embarrassed. Won't win any awards, but funny dialogue, even though there is a sappy ending."
"857",1.5,"  Kevin Hart and Jack Black combined still does not even come closer to Robin Williams' original perfomance"
"858",3.5,"  3.5 An enjoyable continuation of the Jumanji story with a number of nice call-backs to the original to keep this new story within the same universe."
"859",5,"  Really fun show. Jack Black is amazing, they all are really, everyone did a really great job, very fun, well thought out. All in all, great fun!"
"860",0.5,"  Unwatchable, typical, Hollywood JUNK. Why do people think its ok to pay for this crap? PC Hollywood junk is taking over and you people are allowing it to happen. STOP SEEING THIS CRAP."
"861",3.5,"  Not terrible. It has some funny moments, but it's not my kind of movie. If you are a fan of Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart, you'll probably like this movie. It's just not my thing. Karen Gillan was pretty hilarious though."
"862",4.5,"  They did a much better job developing each character is this film then they did in the 1st."
"863",3.5,"  'Welcome to the Jungle' overhauls the mechanics of the original and tries to make it relevant for its modern audience. Though, its star-studded-ness and hilarious banter only lazily makes up for its underwhelming plot. If you want to see it for nostalgia, don't. See it for Jack Black."
"864",5,"  My daughter and I loved Dwayne Johnson performance. He really does a great job bringing the fun!!!"
"865",4,"  Funny movie. Dwayen Johnson as usual at his best. Kevin hart and Jack black has done amazing work. Action is good and funny. Movie as many funny scenes and i love amazing chemistry between all top star cast especially between Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson. Movie get slight predictable towards the end but I would still recommend watching it."
"866",2.5,"  Puntaje Original: 5.5Un guión infantil, con personajes aunque torpes y no bien desarrollados resultan simpÃ¡ticos; en general Jumanji; Welcome to the Jungle aborda ciertos temas que pudieron llegar a ser interesantes pero no son eficazmente trabajados."
"867",4.5,"  Finally checked it out and not as good as I expect seeing the box office but still a good movie very entertaining."
"868",0.5,"  so bad they didnt even bother with cool puzzles or cleverness or any real good jokes really. just missed opportunity for a good vid. watch skull island instead. laaaaaame"
"869",5,"  Without offense to rotten tomatoes.... you guys need a new review board. One of the best sequels to come along this year with as much heart and storytelling as the original and even more funny. A cinematic triumph."
"870",3.5,"  didn't think they could pull off a sequel worthy of the first movie... i was wrong... and thank you Jack Black for the laughs"
"871",3.5,"  Not quite as adventurous as it should be, and it has some annoying moments (especially Kevin Hart and Jack Black), but still, it is exciting and absolutely hilarious!"
"872",3,"  Its not perfect. But certainly entertaining."
"873",3.5,"  Just a lot of fun. Strays significantly from the original, but who cares?"
"874",4,"  Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart re-team in the ever so bankable adventure romp, chock full of more laughs than most comedies, as gamers sucked into the titular game, forced to work together. If fun at the movies is your go-to, go to this one then."
"875",4,"  It's been a while since I watched the original Jumanji, though I was curious as to whether this film would be trying to steal the thunder of that classic film. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this new Jumanji took a unique and more light-hearted twist on the existing story, personally, I would recommend this film if you aren't looking for something too heavy or deep to watch - this film doesn't steal from the original more than it lightly celebrates it whilst it does it's own thing."
"876",3,"  Jumanji is a family comedy that doesn't take too much from the original ,the film itself is well made and has an all star cast !"
"877",4,"  This film does a good job of not taking itself too seriously. The fantasy setting provides an easy-going take on a high-stakes adventure.The laughs come often and feel genuine. Every character really comes to life once our stars take over inside ""Jumanji.""The fun pokes at 90s culture and video game aesthetics are well placed. There is a teaspoon of reminiscence for the original Jumanji but the movie is entirely its own. It is far from deep but touches on some lessons that are well-founded and agreeably useful for teenagers and pre-teens alike."
"878",5,"  I took my daughters to this movie. We could not stop laughing the whole movie. We want to see another sequel. This is excellent family fun I recommend for anyone who wants a fun family night at the movies."
"879",4.5,"  This was a very good & entertaining film"
"880",3.5,"  Possibly the most predictable film plot of all time, the terror of Jumanji is lost. Is it a bad movie however? Not at all. The awkward adaption to their unwanted heroism and urine handles makes the film warm and fun in an industry where everything doesn't have to be so bitter and serious. Would I pick it up on DVD? Probably not. Would I recommend a trip out to see it? Without a doubt. Just remember you're facilitating Dwayne's clear ambition to rule the planet. With Ready Player One and Tomb Raider on the way, it was nice to see a video game film which wasn't annihilated and it gives me hope for those to come.Jumanji's evolution in a struggle for survival and murder of children makes me wonder if a sequel as anything new to offer. Spencer and Martha's decision to return to reality however may have shot down an opportunity to drive a worthy of interest sequel. It was bloody funny though.7.4 / 10"
"881",5,"  Way better than the original."
"882",4,"  Hilarious, Epic, Amusing, and Great Actors."
"883",5,"  It respected the first one in the best way possible!"
"884",3.5,"  Far better than I thought it would be! If you're looking for a good laugh and something to take your mind of things for an hour or two, this film's a good de-stresser."
"885",3,"  Good time at the movies - a popcorn flick worth seeing."
"886",3,"  Fun satisfying semi-sequel to the original. The idea is well done. Jack Black, Karen Gillian, Kevin Hart, and the Rock are all really good. They each have their moment to shine. It's a solid film, with a lot of laughs."
"887",5,"  To be fair, JUMANJI 2 is a much better, more cohesive, more coherent and more satisfying movie and also far more effective family fare, overall than JUSTICE LEAGUE & the new STAR WARS. Faint praise, to be sure but hey, it's factual."
"888",4.5,"  An adventure for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.. Welcome to the Jungle. Jumanji is an adventurous comedy film featuring Dwayne Johnson (Spencer, Dr. Smolder Bravestone), Kevin Hart (Fridge, Franklin ""mouse"" Finbar), Jack Black (Bethany, Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon), and Karen Gillan (Martha, Ruby Roundhouse). When these four high school students are assigned detention together, they discover a video game called Jumanji. They get sucked into the game as the characters they chose with separate unique strengths and weaknesses along with three lives. The four are challenged by a stair case of levels and the only way to return home is to win the game. Director of Jumanji, Jake Kasdan, has also directed movies including: Zero Effect, Orange County, The TV Set, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher, and Sex Tape. Jumanji is extremely comical, the actors play out their characters very well. Jack Black, for example, plays the role of an self centered, vain teenaged girl and does a very good job. Also, there is a lot of action placed in the different levels putting you on the edge of your seat. However, there are some sexual jokes that complement as to why I would not recommend for viewers under age. Like the movie: The Jungle Book, the setting and scenery is absolutely beautiful. The humor and adventure is similar to that in Hook and Night at the Museum. I'd rate Jumanji four and a half out of five stars, so get your tickets before they sell out and try not to drink much soda."
"889",4.5,"  SUPER entertaining and surprisingly original, this sequel to Jumanji is a LOT better than it has any right to be. Loved it!"
"890",4.5,"  Any gamer will WANT to see this! It was brilliantly funny in all the right places."
"891",5,"  Unexpectedly great & funny!"
"892",3.5,"  In general, the film is insanely fun, a good solid laugh ride with some charming leads who work wonders with what they have. Even the stuff that doesn't quite work can still get a little chuckle just from the performances and the incredible set pieces. I expected this to be a total dud of a film, turns out it was pretty damn awesome"
"893",5,"  This movie is so FUNNY ??"
"894",5,"  My family absolutely loved this movie! Great references to the original! 5 stars!"
"895",4,"  Never thought I would say this since the fact that when I read the announcement and saw the cast for the film, I thought it was gonna be crap! And then I saw the Trailer and the title of the film and thought "" Aw fuck here we go another Ragnarok and Justice League 80's song pointless title"" Then a friend of mine dragged me to see it and I was very pleasantly surprised! ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" Is a very entertaining film! I really enjoyed the teen humor, the character arcs and the overall goofiness to the film. Also enjoyed that despite lurking in the shadows of the original it manages to be a good sequel but do it's own thing! although, Robin Williams is sadly missed..."
"896",4,"  Very enjoyable movie, but let me be clear. THIS MOVIE WOULD BE SH** WITHOUT KEVING HART!This is a very good, verry silly comedy, with lots of OVERACTING and lots of clichés, which is done on purpose, to make it even more silly."
"897",5,"  Great movie. Very funny and entertaining. Is family friendly as well. I would recommended to anyone."
"898",1,"  Really cheesy. Really reaching. Predictable dialogue. Walked out of theater with about 20 minutes left in film because it was so awful."
"899",5,"  very funny and a reboot done well, Jack black steals the show as a teenage girl trap in a middle aged man"
"900",3,"  Pleasently surprised the film held it's own. Only I didn't like the getting pulled into a video game aspect...kind of ruins the premise of the franchise a little."
"901",5,"  Liked it better than the 1st film"
"902",5,"  Amazing movie! I loved the video game references, and how the movie does not take itself seriously at all. It's pure, unhinged adventure movie, with plenty of action, suspense, humour, and fun. Other than the occasional self-esteem seeking plot elements, and typical emotional drama, I absolutely loved this movie. A++"
"903",5,"  Love the Movie. Better then the last one. But it could have been more realistic."
"904",3.5,"  Where Westworld offered a more mature (much more) study of video game politics, 2manji here shows us a junior version that entertains just as well."
"905",5,"  I love that it's a stand alone that pays to the 1st film instead of a carbon copy reboot"
"906",5,"  loved this movie. Very unique."
"907",2.5,"  Original was so much better"
"908",4,"  A great adventure and a of fun. All the main characters were great. Jack Black was probably the standout but as a Rock/Hart fan thought they were great together again"
"909",2.5,"  There are two things working in this film's favour: one is the nostalgic value attached to the 1995 original and the brand Jumanji - which, surprisingly and charmingly, is only updated here from the board game to a video game cartridge circa 1996 (but there's always the threequel, folks, for something more 2018) and the other is the simple premise of having well known actors/stars play against type - as in: what if Jack Black plays a self-obsessed girl or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays a nerd. And to this film's credit, they milked them to their fullest extent and manages quite a lot of mileage out of it. Unfortunately the rest of the film feels fairly by the book and the life lessons learnt are admirable but rather tame and unremarkable. The special effects are perfunctory, as are the cast of young unknowns and their more famous counterparts - everyone does a good job but nothing stands out as being particularly spectacular or exciting here. While the video game rules are played out in a consistently fun way and provides a clean and clear structure for the film to hang its set pieces on, the occasional sparks found in the half decent and amusing script might have worked better if they haven't been so overexposed for the trailers. In the end, this is undemanding fluff and manages just not to disappoint (or antagonize) too much in a situation where no one (except the creatively dried up studios) demands a sequel or a reboot but the audience is getting one anyway."
"910",4,"  They all did a great job, & I think this is kevin harts best role other than the one he did in the animated film."
"911",2.5,"  Some of the writing can be rather enjoyable, while other parts of the script and lines of dialogue are just terrible."
"912",3.5,"  Me gusta más el tono y la historia de la original, pero Ã©sta estÃ¡ bien tambiÃ©n a su manera. Se adapta a los tiempos que corren, y estÃ¡ muy entretenida."
"913",3.5,"  Surprisingly good sequel, with good performances by the main cast."
"914",4.5,"  Originally, I held no special desire to watch this film. Friendly overwhelming recommendations convinced me to watch it, and I certainly don't regret it. Humorous and enticing, the plot delivered far more than I expected. Not a minute passed that I was thoroughly entertained. The cast, stock-full of renowned and talented actors, helped to produce a film I would recommend to anyone. Exemplary."
"915",5,"  This was by far one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. Jumanji kept you on the edge of your seat with the adventure while still making you laugh in almost every sentence that was said. This Jumanji was the best one I have seen so far. I would love to watch it again it was that good."
"916",0.5,"  As a nerd, I find this movie insulting.Also as a fan of the original Jumanji, I find this movie bad as f*ck."
"917",5,"  It was better than TLJ"
"918",4,"  A blast with a great cast"
"919",2.5,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle failed to retain audience's attention more than the action scenes and trailer spoiling jokes."
"920",5,"  This movie was very good. I enjoyed the action and comedy in this film. All the actors really filled their roles and got to know their character. In my opinion Jack Black truly made me laugh, the way that he was able to act like Bethany was very impressive. I would no doubt see this movie any time you can."
"921",4,"  Very enjoyable as it should be."
"922",5,"  Hilarious, loved the original and I ALSO love this"
"923",3,"  It was ok but there's nothing like the original....but a good idea having a video game instead of board game!"
"924",5,"  Jumanji Welcome to the jungle was awesome! HILARIOUS. I can't wait to see it again I cried laughing on a lot of the scenes. The entire theater had fun where i'm from."
"925",2.5,"  Here's the thing with most average movies... In the end, you always end up at Point B. Along the journey, chances are that you might end up from Point A to Point C to Point B, but in the end, you will stand at Point B. A straight line is the fastest way to travel. A scientific theory known around the globe. That's the thing with movies. If the creators/directors just go from Point A straight to Point B, it is the fastest but also least captivating. Maybe the director will add some loops and twists and turns and maybe even backtrack a bit, but still, repeatedly I shall say, you shall end standing at Point B. So, since this movie falls straight into this average generalization, I'll give it an average rating..."
"926",5,"  First I'd like to say this is NOT a remake or a reboot. It is a sequel that takes place in the same world that the original film did. The movie was great fun from start to finish. I go to the movies all the time and I've never had people in the audience laughing out loud the entire time. great action and humor. The Rock always entertains and it's worth it just to see Karen Gillan. It was a great cure for the Last Jedi blues."
"927",4,"  Really fun movie, a nice restart for the franchise."
"928",5,"  Just a well-done funny movie. I laughed a lot more than I expected to!"
"929",4.5,"  Jumanji was pretty good. Dwayne Johnson does not get enough credit for his acting. While he may look like Dwayne Johnson. He's a surprisingly versatile actor. He's funny, charming & his comedic timing is great. He really convinces you he's played by a teenage nerd. He is not your typical tough guy action hero. Also Karen Gillan but the person who stood out the most was Jack Black playing his teenage role as Bethany. Too hilarious!"
"930",4.5,"  I decided to see Jumanji since I'm a fan of the Rock and Karen Gillan. It's entertaining. Nothing to debate, nothing thought provoking, nothing to over analyze. Its just lighthearted entertainment and sometimes that's all that's needed."
"931",5,"  Jumanji was a fantastic. For anyone one thinks this was just a cash grab, you'll get your moneys worth. Don't listen to the bitter people, this is something new and enjoyable that the entire family will enjoy. One of the best movie of the year so far. Can't wait to buy it on blu-ray."
"932",4,"  Pretty good movie and quite funny. I enjoyed it"
"933",4.5,"  Although i'm big fan of Dwayne The Rock Johnson, I was skeptical of seeing Jumanji at 1st but it turned out to be one of the funnest movies I've seen in a while."
"934",4.5,"  Jumani: Welcome To The Jungle works because of the great cast, the chemistry between them and some gut-busting laughs. If you are looking for a movie that will entertain you no matter what your age is you will most likely have a good time with this movie. The film also contains some really cool action sequences that I wasn't expecting."
"935",4,"  Fun movie, no crap no sex no dirty language"
"936",5,"  Very colorful film & the cast was chosen perfectly."
"937",2,"  Overhyped. Kind of dumb. And the secondary characters are there just to kill them. No reason - just supposed to kill them."
"938",4.5,"  Not a single dull part to this movie. From the minute they got into the game they to the time they left."
"939",4.5,"  This movie was hilarious!"
"940",4.5,"  This was a fun movie. Jack Black was the best, he is so funny. I went with my friends and family for my birthday and we all enjoyed the movie. I must admit I had my doubts it would be good because I was a big Robin Williams fan. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's also a great movie because there is no foul language, & everyone keeps their clothes on. It just shows that you can make a great comedy in this day and age without dropping an ""F"" bomb every five minutes. I say go to see this movie, get yourself a big bag of popcorn and coke and relax, forget the world outside and just laugh! and laugh hard it will do you a world of good."
"941",2,"  Dumb and even boring at times the movie was a big disappointment..."
"942",4.5,"  One of 2017's best films. Loved that it picked up right where the 1995 version left off. Amazing cast, tons of hilarious moments, & great chemistry."
"943",5,"  The rock and kevin hart work perfectly together!"
"944",4,"  A fun movie recommended for everyone. A surprisingly solid storyline with tons of laughs. Not to mention, Jack Black's acting is hilarious and fantastic as portrays a high school girl trapped in a grown man's body."
"945",5,"  Don't get mad that Jumanji Welcome To The Jungle is doing better than a film you liked. This was a really good movie."
"946",5,"  Great movie. I loved how the character evolved but not so drastically that it made the entire adventure cheesy."
"947",1.5,"  It?s just one of those movies you wonder why are you still watching, hoping for something that you already know it won?t come... if it was played on Netflix I would just turn it off after the first 30min or less. Humor is super dry and silly, acting sooo bad, story dumb... I really don?t see pretty much anything interesting in it at all"
"948",4.5,"  Take it for what it is...a good action/adventure fantasy movie that lets you just enjoy yourself. Sure there's a few plot holes but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I like movies for what they are, and I thought this movie was just a lot of fun from beginning to end. And in my opinon, it was honestly better than the newest Star Wars"
"949",3.5,"  Hysterical! Jumanji is THE film that made me laugh the hardest in 2017. It was surprising entertaining and outrageous, thanks to the incredibly funny ensemble cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. Karen Gillan was superb. The story played on teenage angst and first world problems - like mobile phones and computer games. I died watching Jack Black as a teenage girl, and Dwayne Johnson discovering ""smouldering"" and muscles as a nerdy teen. A fun film, though there were parts where the pace was uneven. I'm sure Sony is all smiles with another new franchise in hand. Here's to better scripts and better story telling, and lots of laughs."
"950",5,"  Well structured, tight plot, great cast, and funny. Very very funny!"
"951",3,"  Pretty poor movie, but The Rock and Kevin Hart are just too good."
"952",4.5,"  Lol at kevin hart stole the show. He is the same in every movie. Loud with a potty mouth, Jack Black, Dwayne & KAren acually convinced you they were playing their characters and there were some really cool fight sequences in this film."
"953",2.5,"  Fun movie but it all felt pointless"
"954",3.5,"  Although it wasn't my favorite it was action packed and a lot of fun definitely a family movie."
"955",0.5,"  I have not seen this film."
"956",3.5,"  Fun movie, lots of well crafted humour. Jack Black and Kevin Hart stole the show."
"957",4,"  actually good, isn't trying to be a remake of the original. actually stands on its own two feet. ,"
"958",4,"  Thrilling, entertaining, and a must see comedy! One of the better movies in an overwhelmingly disappointing Christmas period."
"959",3,"  Fun film to watch with family and friends that is fairly original in premise, but reuses alot of the same jokes through the film."
"960",5,"  If you aren't giving this 5-stars then you must not have watched it. Go back and see it again. This is what an action movie is supposed to be."
"961",5,"  Fantastic movie, i loved it way more than i expected to. Better than the original in every single way in my opinion"
"962",4.5,"  Not as bad as you'd think would be. Jack Black did not act like Jack Black playing a woman, he just acted like a teenage woman. I think he really did his homework with this role. I think the director spent most of his time trying to get Dwayne to act like a scared boy but he just couldn't deliver it. I like Dwayne Johnson but he needs to really step up his acting game if he wants to play none ""The Rock"" rolls. When he needed to be tuff in the movie, he was and he did it very well. But I just didn't believe he was a scared teen as much as Jack Black. Karen Gillan did very well but I think the director left her alone. She did what she could with what she had read about the role. Kevin Hart also did very well well but his character just wasn't explored very much so nothing ventured nothing gained.The story was an excellent update as well as sequel to the original coming of age 1995 version. It works as a meta-comedy of video games without eliminating the emersion of the movie. It's got plenty of action thrown in (as expected given the story) without making you think you're watching an action movie. There's a quick romance shoe-horned in but that's kind of a requirement of any coming of age film. The superb acting of Jack Black (haven't said that in a while) helped a lot with some of the bad writing. Kevin Hart's goofy line towards the end he had to say was covered up by a well-earned meta joke about video game's typically bad writing. Again, nothing ventured, nothing gained in Kevin's acting. Not bad, but not good.All and all, I'd say its worth watching on Netflix for sure, but I wouldn't pay for it in a theater unless you're a fan of the original storyline and really want to see the sequel. Which I am, and I did. As a quick and final note, props to whoever let Karen throw in the Doctor Who reference. Yawzah!"
"963",4,"  Just good fun is what it is!"
"964",4.5,"  Y no le tenÃ­a casi nada de fe"
"965",3.5,"  The film has a lot of charm and hilarious characters but the one thing I hate with this long belated sequels is the lack of story. This is a recycle of the first films plot line, right down to the first character being sucked into the game, surely they could have come up with another plot device after twenty years. I enjoyed the Van Pelt being redesigned for the film, that is an interesting choice for the franchise and means a new actor can be cast if a sequel is required. I think the filmmakers could attempt VR for the sequel but the board game is where the true franchise idea lies. The film is fun and will appeal to family and kids but don't go looking for any great depth of character as this is very run of the mill stuff here. 08-01-2018."
"966",3.5,"  The chemistry between the Rock and Kevin Hart makes this movie enjoyable."
"967",4,"  fun and entertaining"
"968",4,"  Very hilarious movie filled with colorful cinematograhy and intense action sequences."
"969",3,"  Good popcorn movie. Better than The Last Jedi."
"970",4,"  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun family flick. It is extremely funny and is a great evolution of the original. If it tried to undo or completely remake the 1995 Jumanji I would be singing a different tune, but instead Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle simply modernizes a kid's classic. The movie lacks the original's darkness and sense of danger, but does its job holding the audience's attention with great cast chemistry and some solid humor. It gives audiences a fun relaxing ride that the whole family can enjoy."
"971",4.5,"  Very funny film. Loved that awkward kiss scene between martha and spencer.. I was crying."
"972",3.5,"  Original jumani meets the mummy meets Indiana Jones in this action packed comedy. Lots of funny moments, one liners throughout and it looked like the actors had a great time filming it. You could compare it to the original and the original was a great film. This is well worth going to see, very enjoyable"
"973",5,"  Awesome movie and very funny. Great job by all the cast. It's been number one for 2 weeks in a row after dethroning the Last Jedi. I will definitely by the bluray."
"974",5,"  It was way better than I thought it would be. Jack Black was great"
"975",3,"  Fun and funny. Weird penis jokes distract from humor, but still a good time with the family."
"976",4.5,"  Was skeptical going in, remake of Jumanji? Are we really trying to outdo Robin Williams. I was pleasantly surprised. It managed to deliver on a newer version of the movie without leaning too hard on the original. The cast was great and the movie was very funny. Jack Black stole the show as teenage girl. Fun popcorn flick."
"977",4,"  i have watched both star wars and jumanji but if someone asks to watch again either one of them, i will choose jumanji!! a sequel after 22 years, but yet it never seems like the gap between these 2 affected much!! specially the whole cast and the story were very good!! Jack Black and Karen Gillan were incredible!! But Kevin Hart steals the show!! every single moment it was soooo thrilling and entertaining!! the connection between two jumanji was minimal but it was there.. overall a complete entertainment package!!"
"978",4.5,"  Was funny, entertaining and the jokes were pretty good. I'd like to see the continuation with The Rock, Jack, Karen and Hart, like trying to escape from Jumanji or something like that."
"979",4,"  Very funny, very well done.It would be better if they didn't swear as much. There was no need for it"
"980",5,"  After having experienced Jumanji brought into our world as a child, nostalgia was what led me to this sequel. What followed was a hilarious and riveting adventure inside the world we only saw glimpses of so long ago. Fun watch whether you've seen the first or not."
"981",3.5,"  Jumanji was a pleasant surprise overall. Funny, heart warming and adventurous with Jack Black stealing the show."
"982",4,"  A fun movie to see as a family (with teenagers.)"
"983",5,"  The movie was well done, with it's fair share of intense and hilarious moments"
"984",5,"  Very very funny and interesting"
"985",5,"  So good! I love the Rock!"
"986",5,"  Film was amazing, writing at its finest :D"
"987",5,"  Was not expecting this movie to be good at all, but was pleasantly surprised. Movie was hilarious and great. Kinda had a sad moment when they mentioned Alan Perish and I remembered Robin Williams is gone.Overall thoughts. Great movie."

"1",4,"  Loved it as much as the old Tomb Raider!"
"2",3,"  Very predictable, more violent and dark than needs be in many scenes. Not the most believable plot. Despite all these flaws, love Alicia Vikander. Good beginning and decent enough cast, even though the overall experience was quite average. Wouldn?t necessarily recommend and yet, I?d probably watch the sequel if they made one."
"3",2,"  I didnt have any high expectations but still this movie managed to be dissapointing."
"4",5,"  I love this movie. I look forward to watching it again on video."
"5",5,"  It was everything a Lara Croft movie should be. She has Stamina, A great Story, and now i can't wait for a sequel! Awesomesauce!"
"6",2,"  Cannot stand this actor. Actually, if she could stop her hoarse screeching and grunting and screaming, it might have been okay. Whoever told her that was the great way to show suffering should be fired. That's my main thing, it was so grating - just over and over scream and screech and squeak. When I've been in terrifying situations, I'm not screeching and screaming and squeaking, and neither does any other real female that I know. I hope to never watch her in another movie unless she knocks that crap off."
"7",4,"  The acting and the story was superior to the action. The action, for me, was just to over the top. I liked the story and the characters."
"8",4.5,"  Finally a video game movie adaptation worth watching! There's some room for improvement, but I'd be thrilled to see sequels."
"9",2,"  Had high expectations but as I thought this movie can't beat Angelina Jolie's. Quite predictable, kind of boring but it was average."
"10",3.5,"  Alicia Vikander is a fresh start for the video game heroine we grew to love since the 90's. But the ones in the early 2000's with Angelina Jolie ,were awful. With the 2013 reboot and the most recent Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft was given a more instinctive nature that shows the skills she possesses, rather than the goods ;). While this film did have it's flaws, I enjoyed watching her character grow."
"11",4.5,"  with regard to games, i prefer final fantasy and dragon warrior over tomb raider. as far as movies go, turns out tomb raider is my crack. only bit that rang false was lu ren sounding vaguely north american., instead of chinese, or at least british. took off half a star for that. sorry for the caps lock, something's wonky with my notebook..."
"12",5,"  Loved Alicia Vikander in this film, very good visual effects as well."
"13",3.5,"  Something for every TOMB RAIDER fan to watch. It's fun, action-packed and dramatic. This Portrayal of Lara Croft was like seeing her first adventure, judging by how the character reacts to intense sequences in the movie, it's Lara's First Adventure. And I hope to see more of these movies in the near future. I loved the game, and I'll say the same for the movie."
"14",4,"  I really enjoyed it, and I can't wait for a sequel."
"15",4,"  I personally loved the move a lot. For those that have played the game, i think that they would agree when i say that the movie stayed true to the character we all know and love.The way the movie explored the character of Lara was very good. I think that this film did a great job of capturing the essence of Lara Croft unlike the other Tomb raider movies by Angelina."
"16",4,"  definitely a good entertaining movie! I personally liked this more than the original one. I grew up on tomb raider, and was expecting a shot for shot of the 2013 reboot game, but this was a really great adaptation with some different twists. a few acting mishaps here and there with supporting characters, but alicia KILLED her role and this was a really great movie!! definitely go see it, tomb raider fan or not!"
"17",1,"  Bad acting to bad stunts movie sucks"
"18",3,"  Energetic and fun at times, completely boring at others. Probably better than the Angelina versions if I am honest. Could have gone a little deeper, but it was fine for what it was."
"19",2,"  when the most interesting scene in the movie is the last one ..........enough said"
"20",1.5,"  It was fun. Good action. But felt like one long video game cut scene. Didn't believe the character arcs and didn't find myself wowed at any point in the movie."
"21",4,"  Really good reboot of the tomb raider movie series. I enjoyed the pace and action in the movie and the performances were spot on. Not much humour but that was good as it could have just been a camp runaround. The actress who played Lara Croft did really well. I was impressed."
"22",4,"  Very entertaining and edge of your seat! I want more!"
"23",2.5,"  Acting: Alicia Vikander gave a very good performance as Lara Croft and was the highlight of this film. However, she was let down by the acting around her. Storyline: I felt the storyline really became stuck in places and there was a lot of lazy writing. Another aspect of the film that really let down the brilliant approach of Alicia VikanderPacing: Due to the failures of the storyline the pacing of the film was all over the place. At moments it felt like not much was happening and then things were happening too quickly. Genre: For an action film I didn't really feel like there was a lot of action and what there was could have been done better. Enjoyment: The film was ok. I really enjoyed the last 15-20 minutes of the film and found myself wondering why the rest of the film couldn't have been as good. There were moments throughout where Alicia Vikander gave really compelling performances but I found myself daydreaming in places where the storyline faltered."
"24",5,"  Great film, similar to the games in many ways, though the story is different."
"25",2.5,"  The movie is not perfect. There are many things one can complain about. But overall, it's entertaining and much better than Wonder Woman."
"26",3.5,"  Take as a purely action flick, movie is pretty good. I liked a lot of the visual effects, and to me Matthias was an excellent antagonist."
"27",5,"  The best Tomb Raider/Video game adaptation ever!"
"28",4,"  A grounded and more realistic version of the iconic female protagonist. Paying proper homage to the reboot game which you will like even if you didn't play the game but will absolutely love it if you did."
"29",4,"  Considering the bad reputation of video game movies, I was surprised by Tomb Raider. I have actually played some of the games so I did feel like certain things fitted in the games. This movie is an origin story for the character but it's based more off of the 2013 game. I have only played the games from the second era. You know, the ones where Lara was trying to find out what happened to her mother? The action sequences actually do feel like something out of a Tomb Raider game. The platforming elements, the bow-and-arrow and some tense moments actually feel like a quick time event. Naturally, since that's what the third era of games are built upon, the movie has Uncharted elements. Alicia Vikander is actually a pretty good choice for Lara Croft, especially this one based off of the M-rated games. I have never seen the Angelina Jolie movies but she does look perfect for the choice of Croft as well since they both base themselves off of their attractiveness and resourcefulness at the same time. Perhaps the braid and dual pistols at the end of the movie are a bit too much for the sake of fanservice. The sequel hook at the end for me was ""...eeeeehhhh"". I didn't think I would enjoy Tomb Raider as much as I did but here I am. Maybe I should see more Alicia Vikander movies. The movie rises on the strength of her performance."
"30",2.5,"  sometimes the average is right"
"31",3.5,"  The heart of Tomb Raider is there they did their homework sadly the execution is lacking on some aspects and they took several liberties with the characters and the story overall but is really hard to adapt such a lengthy story and cram it all together in only one movie, they put the effort."
"32",4,"  awesome, fact paced , ????????????"
"33",4,"  This felt more like the Lara I used to manoeuvre in the video games, trying to survive and succeed both in the old and new genres. I love this film reboot and watching Alicia wikander establish herself as lara. Alicia brings lara to life very much in the way I had hoped to see in the earlier films. There are some great moments in this film and I look forward to a sequel, with a stronger story line I hope."
"34",3.5,"  Video game movie adaptations, boy have they been bad. Here is one that is not bad, not stupid, and very watchable. Cool!There's not a lot to say about Tomb Raider. It's an action movie, and it succeeds at that in nearly every way. The action scenes are interesting and fun to watch. Alicia Vikander, who did nearly all her own stunts, is also great. She helms the role in a way that will please fans of the game. While in the original movies, Lara Croft was very sexualized, but in this reboot, she is a strong female hero, which is amazing and refreshing to see in a blockbuster. The stunt work and action scenes are fantastic. I have only a few problems with this movie. The beginning relies on narration, which is really unnecessary and weird. Everything that is explained in the beginning is directly explained later, so why is it there? The story is pretty generic, too.Tomb Raider tries to adapt the 2013 reboot game and is mostly successful. It's an enjoyable action movie that I would recommend, and is definitely the best video game adaptation, but there isn't too much competition. It's a video game movie that is action-packed and enjoyable, and has a female action hero, which is awesome! While it's not without it's flaws, I think it's worth seeing."
"35",2.5,"  Angelina's First is irreplaceable"
"36",1,"  Terrrible....(Awful)...Direction of a bloated screenplay wastes the acting talent of the cast and makes you appreciate the video games which seem masterpieces of storytelling in comparison."
"37",4.5,"  The original movies were like the original games; an oversexualised Lara, over the top moments and not a lot of character. This was more like the new games; a more grounded setting, better story and characters, and more sense. It also stands out compared to other video game movies like Mario Bros as an enjoyable movie for fans and newbies to the series."
"38",2.5,"  MINOR SPOILERS.I was forced to go see this because my girlfriend is in it. She was great, as always, but was held down by the constraints of a relatively uninteresting story and a mediocre script. This could have been compelling and a fine start to a franchise. It wasn't. The script never popped. It never rose above the pedestrian. It never became memorable.The first 20 minutes of the film was totally wasted and could have been handled better with a mere three minutes of skillful writing. Several of the scenes were complete throwaways. Thus, the very weak first act failed to establish interest and convincingly build both the character origin and necessary relationships. Instead, we got a silly bike race. I can only recall a single outfit for Alicia, whose grace and beauty should have been far better utilized in the setup at the very least.The initial second act Hong Kong scene also a total waste that should have been cut from the script before production. Walter Goggins did a good job, but the villain he portrayed was a cardboard cutout without depth, sufficient motivation, or any redeeming qualities. A one-dimensional and unconvincing baddy who also couldn't overcome a boring script. His character created an unnecessary plot hole left unexplained and gaping like an open wound. Rote and verbatim oral and visual repetition of the subject of the whole quest seemed to indicate they knew the whole point of the story was weak and uninteresting. Rather than fix it, they just repeated it to make sure we didn't miss the little bit they had done. The twist wasn't one, and was obvious from the beginning, lifted wholesale from ROTLA III. The stakes never felt real or significant, although they should have. The final cliffhanger a seeming paradox that could have been easily resolved by the father, yet was inexplicably left to become the story's not-so-secret moving evil force. Had the father simply removed the impediment in his control, there wouldn't have been any story at all. Hard to believe that none of these things were addressed before the flat, mediocre script went into production.Hadn't seen Daniel Wu before. He was excellent, but just as they began to use him effectively, they cut his involvement and forgot what was working. Disintegrates into a CGI fest that mimics and palely echoes ROTLA. Still worth seeing if only for Alicia, but a very mediocre film. **.5 /*****. 49/62."
"39",4,"  We Liked the suspense of the movie it was fun it was adventurous and we enjoyed it"
"40",0.5,"  Horrible movie! So predictable, just play the video game instead. Found it really boring, don't waste your time or money seeing it"
"41",3,"  Not as good as I hoped but not as bad as I feared. Tomb Raider is a decent adaptation with a great performance from Alicia Vikander, who was more or less perfect casting as Croft."
"42",2.5,"  The previews are the best part of this movie"
"43",3.5,"  Was bad but i like the first movie better"
"44",5,"  Good action movie. Alicia Vikander is great as young Lara.Well worth seeing. Far better than any of the Angelina jolie era tombraider movies, and stays faithful to the new generation of Tombraider games. One of the best movies based on a video game in my opinion."
"45",4.5,"  I almost did not go see this in the theaters due to all the mediocre and bad reviews, but they are all undeserved. This new reboot of Tomb Raider brought some gripping and intense scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. Alicia Vikander more than live up to the part and delivered a very sexy and fierce young Lara Croft while remaining vulnerable when a scene called for it. The action is good, the special effects are great, and the acting is convincing and not over the top like many movies of this genre. It was impressive. This is by far the best movie based on a video game I have ever seen."
"46",5,"  At last, a fully fleshed out Lara Croft for 2018! Those who know me know I'm a Tomb Raider fan. I played all the games, love the movies, collected the comic books and action figures, and did plenty of cosplay back in the day for contests and cons.This year's Tomb Raider - 2018 pulls the entire IP together with a totally believable Lara Croft. Brilliantly acted, this rendition took the time to flesh out Lara with an updated backstory and character arc that is touching and heartfelt.Gone are the campy villains of previous cinematic portrayals. Lara faces a truly desperate psychopath in her quest to discover the fate of her father. She gathers friends and allies that support the story admirably. Gone is the pandering body padding. Instead, we are treated to an athletic protagonist capable of meeting the physical challenges that confront her.Reckless, vulnerable, ambitious, independent, charismatic, and a little naive, Alicia Vikander as young Lara brings her origin story to life. Without pulling punches (literally), this movie magically incorporates both classic and contemporary game memes with a Lara who redefines today's vibrant female hero.And it's got action, puzzles, and pathos with a mere touch of humor. I just finished watching it the 3rd time, and it holds up to close scrutiny. Tomb Raider - 2018, I love what you've done with Lara. Can't wait for the sequel."
"47",3,"  good but not the best"
"48",0.5,"  Boring. This is based on a video game and doesn't need to be ""realistic"". As a big fan of Tomb Raider and especially Lara Croft I couldn't stop myself from falling asleep."
"49",0.5,"  We did not intend to see this movie but we did only because of free tickets that was given to us.There are many kindergarten school plays that's better than this movie and if anyone seen the movie, they would think my comment is an insult to kindergarten school plays. I apologize to all the kindergarten teachers for the comment.This is my first Tomb Raider and I don't understand how the studio approve of this script. If you are the writers (I can't believe if there is more than one but just in case), congratulations, you have pulled off the greatest scam or prank in history. Hats off to you!Storyline doesn't make sense and the dialogues are intolerable. I wanted to walk out but my wife wouldn't let me because she thought the movie was gonna turn around. Well she thought wrong! We both now live in regret....Half a star is hyping up the movie"
"50",1,"  Alicia is mesmerizing as Lara Croft, but not even her looks nor the look of the film could penetrate through the boredom that indulges this pacing for tomb raiders of the found ark."
"51",4,"  A underated movie, Tomb Raider is an excellent film to experience. Certainly go see this"
"52",5,"  Great movie adaptation of the 2013 reboot!"
"53",4,"  IF you liked the video game you will like this movie because the two are remarkably similar in story and in the flow of the action. Well made action scenes combined with a compelling performance by vikander make for an awesome movie event."
"54",4.5,"  This was a great movie, great cast and an action packed story."
"55",3.5,"  TO SEE OR NOT TO SEE? A BIg fat yes! The kind of movie you and your better half would both enjoy. The special effects were excellent and I think the rating should at least be 60%. It was very suspenseful and well worth my time and money"
"56",3.5,"  A strong female lead, lots of action and thrills. Definitely a bonus seeing some game sequences come to life! Alicia makes her role as Lara seem tailor fit. Now, if only the story line was not so lack luster ..."
"57",4,"  Although this movie is slightly slow at times, it is also suspenseful and full of action. I like the mythology surrounding it, and the ending was very good."
"58",5,"  its a better game game then people think it is..."
"59",2,"  It was too predictable, everything she needed for every situation was within reach,how convenient , it was a fast pace action that's all"
"60",4.5,"  love it ,everything was great cant wait for next one"
"61",4,"  far better than I expected, 2018's Tomb raider is a gripping adventure film with a Lara that feels like a human being rather than a sexy action figure."
"62",4,"  Hannah John-Kamen steals the show!"
"63",5,"  Lara not being a super model with large assets made the story feel much more believable. Alicia Vikander looks exactly like the version of Lara Croft in the recent Tomb Raider video game reboot that she's supposed to be playing!"
"64",3,"  Guessing someone involved in this was a big Last Crusade fan....Still fairly entertaining despite the feeling I had seen this movie before."
"65",2.5,"  What to say about this film. I liked about half of it, and at different points. Maybe it's because it felt like 3 different movies during each act. I will try not to spoil the movie but will probably explain basic elements of each act to demonstrate my point. So the first act felt like your typical college film about a young 20-something year old woman trying to make ends meet while living in busy London. That was fun, funny, not tomb raider, but overall fine. Once the second act begins (the adventure) it tries to become this mysterious quest surrounding questions about Lara's father. Overall this part of the movie is boring, uninteresting, and predictable. And the second act feels like it drags on forever. But the third act is where we get actual tomb raiding and adventure/action akin to the video game series. Really liked the third act. So the movie was a rollercoaster in terms of quality. If you're a fan of the two new video games (like I am) you might like, but other wise it's not that good. But its still not terrible enough to maybe wait for a matinee screening or redbox."
"66",0.5,"  Really disappointing, rubbish story line, nothing happens. Had potential but was a load of crap."
"67",1,"  With a plot that is full of logical flaws, and characters that don?t click, this verison of Croft often feels laughable, and not in a good way."
"68",5,"  I honestly think the main reason people are giving this film flak, is that Laura Croft doesn't have giant breasts and her body isn't a main focus of filming. Tomb Raider stands on its own story. To be fair, it isn't the g.o.a.t, but it is an engaging and entertaining film. It is certainly a fun film worth watching."
"69",5,"  Fresh from the vine. much better than the Angelina big chest version. Supports the game well."
"70",4,"  Better than the Angelina Jolie films of 17 yrs ago. The story is not over the top, but it could have been a bit crazier. Walton Goggins makes a good villian."
"71",3.5,"  Better then expected. Lots of crazy action that makes no sense but it works."
"72",5,"  Finally a balanced work. Although need more desperate situations to create tensions."
"73",4.5,"  For a video game movie I must say it is one of the better ones."
"74",3,"  Don't let the reviews get you down, this is a fun action flick with a strong lead in the iconic role of Lara Croft. Following the story of the reboot 2013 Tomb Raider game, the story takes place on a lost island off Japan with the mystery of an ancient power and an evil force coming after it. It veers enough from the story of the game to keep fans guessing and it really helps the film stay grounded. There are problems, the lack of other major female characters makes the film feel a little unbalanced with a lot of male perspectives in a film that would have been far more interesting with other ideas. It also seems the budget of the film limited the scope of the production as there were some impressive elements of the game that would have improved the spectacle of the film. If you love action films and have an affinity with the Tomb Raider franchise I would recommend seeing this movie."
"75",3,"  the movie was good, but the movie was only good because the only interesting character we got was Lara..."
"76",4,"  In my opinion this movie was quite an upgrade from the previous installments (starring Angelina Jolie) I really loved Alicia Vikander's performance as Laura Croft. It was a combonation of her acting ability and the writing of the character. I felt that this team had a better idea of what the games are like and stuck more to the source material. I enjoyed the development of the character in the beginning even if it were a little slower I think it will pay off especially if they have a sequel in mind. Really fun action flick."
"77",3,"  At first i didnt have high hopes for this movie cause every game adapted movie has failed miserablely but from after seeing the movie it was better then i assumed. A bit of a average action origin movie but would have to be the best game adapted movie made so far and Alicia Vikander did brilliant as lara croft if there will be a sequal i'll look forward to seeing her return as the tomb raider and hopefully they can do a bit more with the movie."
"78",2.5,"  Vikander is great with the physicality other than that I didn't really find much endearing here."
"79",5,"  Definitely different than the video game is based off of but quite enjoyable and a new twist on the same basic story. Alicia Vikander delivers a stellar performance. I hope to see more of her as Lara."
"80",5,"  This is the best adaptation of a video game ever!"
"81",5,"  My Favorite Movie of The Year So Far Had Great Action!"
"82",4,"  As far as video game to movie adaptations go, this movie is by far the best that I have seen. Any deviation from the video game canon only serves to amplify, and not detract from, the story and character development. This crossover grounds several of the elements that would be farfetched in reality but is commonplace in today's video games, and this makes this movie all the better. Better still, I found myself at the edge of my seat just as I do at home when the action sequences began. Alicia Vikander plays a wonderful Croft, not like the campy Jolie version. This movie is a must see for anyone who truly enjoys the Croft universe. 4 out of 5 for this highly enjoyable adaptation."
"83",2.5,"  It was actually decent, once in to the movie it has a rocky start but a pretty good ending."
"84",5,"  Go see it, it's really good IMO."
"85",4.5,"  Loved it, even for those who haven't played the game this is a thrilling adventure, Alicia Vikander is incredible in the role of Lara and I was surprised by how realistic the movie was, certain scenes are hard to watch as you can see the physical and emotional impact combat has on her character. I have a few problems with the movie that I wish wern't there but didn't significantly hurt my viewing, the music is pretty generic and the twist at the end was unnecessary and sequel- baiting. Despit these small flaws I definitely recommend this movie to fans of the game or general viewers."
"86",4,"  Alicia Vikander makes an excellent and engaging Lara Croft. The story is slight and shows its video game roots with Lara leaping from obstacle to obstacle. It has all the improbabilities of most action films but Tomb Raider still manages to be fun."
"87",3,"  Tomb Raider is one of the best video games movies to date. However, this is not saying too much as the translation from the console to the big screen has been subpar in general. Despite the poor reputation of video game movies coming into Tomb Raider, it holds its own as an enjoyable action thriller. The movie features a lot of elements from the 2013 reboot of the game, but differs with the story. Alicia Vikander is good as Lara Croft and holds true to the version portrayed in the 2013 reboot. Her backstory is a little different, as she chooses not to attend university and lives a quiet life in London, but this benefits Lara's character. We get to see her struggle in these early stages, and she builds and grows as a character when facing difficult situations throughout her journey. After getting arrested, she is bailed out by one of her father's business partners Ana Miller, where Lara receives her father's inheritance. This leads to clues and an adventure to the island of Yamatai in the Devil's Sea. Lara is accompanied by a ship captain named Lu Ren, who is a decent character, but does not receive the screen time to overcome his one dimensional presence. The story on the island is a little underwhelming and the pace moves very fast until the tomb is opened. This is where some of the sequences from the video game are featured however, and the best action scenes take place. The villain Mathias is very underused in the film. There are a few scenes where his intimidating and reckless presence are felt, but there is not enough of them to fully understand or care about Mathias. The story of the curse of the island stems away from the video game version, but still works. The Third Act is also very action packed, and tests Lara as a character, which builds on her arc from the First Act. The visuals of the movie are stunning, as the action sequences are very realistic and the camera angles add to the intensity and stakes of these. It can be a little unrealistic in the aftermath of some of these sequences, as Lara survives a lot and has very little physical injury. Overall, Tomb Raider is a step forward in the right direction for video games movies. Alicia Vikander provides a good interpretation as Lara Croft, providing great acting performance and her arc sees her grow as a character throughout the film. The story is a little underwhelming and differs from the source material in many ways, but the action and Lara's strong character make up for most of these flaws. The most important aspect of the Tomb Raider reboot is that the character of Lara is well cast and proves a strong and likeable character. This will bode well for potential sequels, as the plot can always be improved."
"88",1.5,"  Boring! Dialogue incoherent"
"89",4,"  Normally video game adaptation movies tend to flop due to its weak plot and poor execution on the tone, but 2018's Tomb Raider does not belong to that category as it exceeds my expectation. First off, Alicia Vikander is almost the perfect casting choice for Lara Croft as she is really a great actress and does have the looks and body shape for the character in 2013's Tomb Raider, the other casts such as Dominic West and Daniel Wu also did a good job on portraying their respective roles. It started off showing Lara Croft's life before she goes to her adventure with a fun tone and surprisingly realistic scenes. When Lara Croft arrived to the mysterious island, it has lots of cool action scenes with good CGI and fighting choreography that will make you get on the edge of your seat. This movie is not perfect by all means, its plot isn't something groundbreaking or original, and although Walton Goggins did provide a menacing antagonist, it does not have any backstory or character development to allow us to sympathize with his motives and intentions, they should've added a flashback with Lara Croft's father to let us know more about the character. Also, the pacing of the movie is a bit too fast as they tend to skip through the decisions of some of the characters without explaining too much. Overall, this movie is a lot of better than the two Tomb Raider movies by Angelina Jolie, and also provided a good origin movie if it does well enough to have a sequel for this franchise."
"90",5,"  A decent plot, great CGI, action scenes are good and well executed. Not Perfect But Still Well Done. With that said, this is entertaining and a really fun movie to watch.Alicia Vikander carried the role beautifully"
"91",2.5,"  While there's certainly some fun to be had, an inactive and uninteresting protagonist where there should be one empowered and exciting brings an already bland story tumbling down."
"92",5,"  Loved the movie and reboot. Shows Lara from the very beginning. Loved her look and that the shorts were ditched."
"93",3.5,"  Video game movies, for the most part, just completely fail, or at least are entertaining enough where it doesn't matter if they're bad (looking at you, RESIDENT EVIL series). This one didn't. I was satisfied with WARCRAFT and CASTELVANIA anime, and thought they were good enough to set a standard. This one went above the standard. And don't worry if the end is predictable; we've played the video games to know how it starts, and what are the environs. If Vikander wants or is willing to do another, that's fine with me."
"94",4,"  Nice, escapist fun. Similar in tone to the last two games."
"95",3,"  Like I said before, to cute for Lara."
"96",5,"  Loved it. I really enjoyed that the main character was a strong women because people usually believe that men are the ones who are strong. It was a very good movie"
"97",4,"  I really enjoyed this new Tomb Raider. I think everyone should give it a chance! I don't see how its so much different than the cheesy ones with Angelina Jolie....except Vikander looks more human! My only slightly complaint is that they altered the video game plotline. Himiko was different in the video game. However, this is a good start to a new type of Tomb Raider. I really want to see another! PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER!"
"98",2.5,"  Well, I had awaited this flick with quite some anticipation, and while Alicia makes for quite a good representation of the young Lara, something just didn't come across as it should have. I felt the supporting cast was simply too cheap (B-movie actors) to have her face a worthwhile opponent. All in all it is watchable but it won't get you too excited. And I even watched it in a 4DX cinema. In a normal cinema one might feel a bit of drag. 5/10 points. One can, if one owns a big screen, easily wait for it to come out on Blue Ray or cable TV."
"99",3.5,"  There are some really good elements here - great performances and plenty of exciting action. Unfortunately, the story is so listless is barely gives anyone anything interesting to do."
"100",4,"  Really enjoyed it. REALLY liked how they did the ""stop motion"" or ""stop scene"" focus parts where they show how LC acquired her signature tools that are sooooo much a part of the recent game. Loved it."
"101",4,"  Excellent action flick. Vikander is great in the role. So glad to see another powerful woman role without making use of a romantic subplot."
"102",5,"  Fab movie better than the original"
"103",0.5,"  Very weak reboot that no one wanted"
"104",4,"  Yoooooooooo this movie had some bad ass moments that were fucking brutal. It may not be the greatest movie but it's worth a watch for sure."
"105",2.5,"  It was a meh kinda movie"
"106",3,"  The visuals in this film are amazing. A lot of scenes look like they have been taken straight out of the games, most notably the plane scene. Has a fantastic performance by Alicia Vikander and she really tries with the terrible script she was given. The other performances are mediocre at best. Overall, it was fine. 6/10"
"107",0.5,"  OMG all I could think as I watch this film was ffs your Laura Croft show them that . and what about the dad thing ffs"
"108",3.5,"  Good solid story and reboot of the franchise. Entertaining and I liked the fact that the character was not overly sexualised."
"109",3,"  This is the ""exact tomb raider"" as we wanted to see. Alicia was really good on her character but still a complete bland plot was quite marred the whole movie. The whole action of the movie was quite similar to the game and the look of it as well. But undoubtedly this is the best tomb raider of three but still so many shortage to build a game originated movie.. yet again...hope the 2nd one (if there is any) will do better story..."
"110",4,"  Everyone is forgetting that this is a movie based on a video game! I have very low standards or expectations for a movie based on a game. However, this was very well done. I loved it and will probably see it again. It made me want to play the games again."
"111",3.5,"  Tomb Raider is perhaps one of the most storied franchises in gaming. Its first entry came in 1996, courtesy of Core Design and Eidos Interactive. PC gaming was awash with an endless glut of ""Doom Clones"" - a trend which would continue until Quake and Half-Life solidified First-Person shooters into something more substantial than cheap imitations. Tomb Raider didn't bother imitating the herd - it opted for a Third-Person perspective, a dual-pistol wielding female protagonist, and an emphasis on platforming - and all in glorious 3D. Its heroine, Lara Croft was seen both as a step forward for women in gaming AND a deeply sexist character tailor made for the male gaze of the gaming community, as she was complete with short shorts and large pixelated breasts. Conceptually she was also a cross between James Bond and Indiana Jones, leaning heavily on the Bond side with the wealthy Scottish background, posh British education, and cavalier attitude toward sex. The franchise would continue through the late 90's and early 00's and would devolve into a series of increasingly stale and unimaginative sequels. In 2013, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics would give the series a much-needed reboot in the vein of Batman Begins and Casino Royale, with a dark, stripped-down origin story. The combat, shooting mechanics, and storytelling were inspired by the recent Uncharted games, while the platforming and open-world elements took from Assassin's Creed. The former of which is particularly notable, as Uncharted took inspiration from Tomb Raider, and now helped shape the Tomb Raider reboot. Lara Croft also went through extensive redesign. Gone was the cocksure, sociopathic Chaotic-Neutral protagonist of yore. Croft was now a naÔve, fresh-faced college graduate who is forced to evolve and adapt under desperate circumstances. Lacking her trademark dual pistols with bottomless magazines, her weapons became a bow, a pickaxe, and whatever rusty WWII or Cold War era weaponry she could scavenge. Perhaps most controversially her physique changed. While the new Lara was still conventionally attractive and umm... quite... ample, she was realistically proportioned and no longer the cartoonish build that bordered on self-parody. Most gamers moved on without issue, but a few outliers decried it as a feminist hijacking of their favorite series. Either way, Tomb Raider 2013 was a success and it spawned a recent sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, that managed to outperform and improve on the original and ensure that the reboot timeline was here to stay.Inevitably, Hollywood wanted a piece of the treasure. Tomb Raider got two big-budget Hollywood movies - in 2001 and 2003. Like other video game flicks of the era, they were more tongue-in-cheek than anything else and barely resembled the games they were trying to emulate, other than character costumes. They were farcical, silly things that were moderately successful due to Angelina Jolie being a rising star at the time. Star + Concept and all. And to be fair she did nail the Lara Croft of that era, but the movies themselves were fairly shit. However, with the recent reboot and the new Lara - it was inevitable that Hollywood take another swing.So, we finally arrive at the point. The new Tomb Raider may be the best video game adaptation ever made. While many might say that doesn't amount to much or that I'm exaggerating, it should be noted that is of comparable quality to a recent number of video game pictures that are deeply flawed but are still acceptable popcorn entertainment (think Silent Hill, Prince of Persia, and Assassin's Creed.) Tomb Raider's focus, lead performance from Alicia Vikander, and the refreshing small-scale, realistic action make it a hair better than the rest. It very loosely follows the 2013 reboot and throws in some elements from Rise of the Tomb Raider, as well. Several of the action scenes work, in particular one using Lara's new favorite weapon and another involving a crumbling WWII Japanese bomber suspended over a waterfall, which was lifted wholesale from the game. Vikander fits into Croft's boots comfortably and like Jolie before her, seems to fit into that Star + Concept mold that Hollywood claims to chase for female action stars. I do think Tomb Raider would have been a great film had it stuck to the 2013 game a bit more. Lara was stuck on that godforsaken island for QUITE some time, forced to scavenge and hunt. She had to evolve over time. Plus, there were characters like Samantha and the other members of her crew that fleshed out the story. Mattias was not a generic villain, but a mad cultist who wanted to raise an angry goddess for selfish reasons. The inclusion of Lara's father and the organization Trinity are both from Rise of the Tomb Raider and are out of place here narratively. In other words, it's a bit overstuffed. But it's still worth a viewing. We are hinted bigger and better sequels. Who knows? We may finally get a truly great video game movie some day!"
"112",3,"  Ms Vikander shows that she can act. She was very good in the dialogue driven scenes: and even better in the action sequences. The problem here is a weak story line. It did not make much sense. Also, the PC police seemed to be at work. Our very attractive heroine is captured by a murderous bad guy. The beautiful Ms Vikander is the only woman in sight. She is put to heavy manual work along with the male captives. There is no hint of potential sexual assault or even casual leering. She remains fully clothed in a steamy tropical location. This is not plausible. It was an OK trip to the flics."
"113",4,"  Uma adapta√ß√£o de videogame boa. carregada de clich√™s e tal, mas ei, √© um filme de aventura divertido e bem filmado. Era s√≥ isso que eu queria mesmo."
"114",3,"  It's OK to Good. It's keep you mostly entertained, with a great lead performance by Alicia Vikander, and it holds promise for future chapters in the franchise."
"115",0.5,"  This is a genuinely awful film, the only good thing about it will be seeing CinemaSins rip it to shreds. The plot is nonsensical, which can be forgiven because it's an action flick, but what I cannot excuse is that the action sequences in Ferris Bueller's Day Off are more thrilling.At a character level, this movie makes Lara a total idiot (NB mild spoilers ahead). Her marvellous plan at the start of the film is to agree to cause literally tens or hundreds of thousands of ¬£ worth of criminal damage to get paid ¬£600. Her plan in the middle of the film is to run off (injured) on her own with no food, water, medical supplies or WAY OF GETTING OFF THE ISLAND. Her plan towards the end is to strand a baddie by taking out the only escape route across a bridge - she is literally half way across the bridge at this point she could easily cross it to safety and take it down from the safe side, but no, she needs to go back to the side with the baddie so she can get stranded with him... Don't get me started on the magic reloading guns, the tomb-raiding party carrying everything including the kitchen sink, the boat trip to an island North East of Japan starting from Hong Kong... Ludicrous from start to finish."

"117",2.5,"  Todos os filmes que se inspiram em jogos T√äm a fama de serem maus, por√©m tomb raider, apesar de n√£o ser um sucesso √© sem duvidada a melhor adapta√ß√£o de um jogo para o cinema feita at√© hoje, com elenco de peso, uma personagem principal forte e uma hist√≥ria CONvincente. mas apesar disso tudo n√£o deixa de ter erros como os personagens secund√°rios que n√£o s√£o bem aproveitados, ou cenas muito PREVIS√çVEIS e todos os mist√©rios do filme s√£o resolvidos pela protagonista com uma perna √°s costas sem o TELESPECTADOR ter oportunidade de tentar resolv√™-los."
"118",4,"  Very entertaining and set up well for the saga to continue..."
"119",4.5,"  Great adaptation, they had to par the story from the game down a bit but still had the spirit of the story. Should make for a good series of movies."
"120",3.5,"  I kind of liked it. I have not played the recent games, but I remember the old ones (my dad played them and I watched and helped him). I do believe Alicia Vikander looks like Tomb Raider and the suspension of disbelief worked very well. It was a typical Tomb Raider-story, made less fantasy than the game actually was.I loved that in some scenes you really have the feeling you are playing the game. The graphics looked somehow different than in other movies.For my taste there could have been more puzzles to solve, but overall it was fine adventure-movie."
"121",3.5,"  Loved the story but had some unnecessary plot points. But good unless."
"122",5,"  Saw this in an early screening this past Tuesday & I loved it! So very different from the original Jolie movies & better is so many ways! The storyline is fnatastic & Vikander is one bad a#$ Lora Croft!"
"123",3.5,"  Not sure why no one is talking about the fact that it's easily the best video game adaptation ever. Action was really good, and Alicia Vikander brought justice to the character called Lara Croft.Movie has slightly different story related to Himiko from the first reboot game, and has few things from the second game as well. Movie did a good job to combine the elements from both the movies.There were some issues that I found but overall a good action movie."
"124",3.5,"  I enjoyed it. Very good reboot of Tomb Raider."
"125",3.5,"  Ever since her father (Dominic West) disappeared from her life, Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) lives a carefree life in the city despite being the heir to his massive fortune. When she finally agrees to inherit her father's business and manor however, Lara discovers a secret office where she finds evidence that he might be alive on an uncharted island believed to hold a powerful treasure sought by the shady organization, Trinity.Aside from Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, Lara Croft is one of the most popular video game characters of all time. Ever since her creation in 1996 by the British video game company Core Design, this archaeologist has appeared in so many videogames, comics and even two live-action films with Angelina Jolie starring as Lara Croft, that her popularity even rivals that of Indiana Jones himself. Although most video-game film adaptations are mostly terrible train wrecks with the likes of Warcraft, Assassin's Creed and Uwe Boll's entire filmography, Norwegian director Roar Uthaug combines elements from the classic games with the gritter 2013 reboot of the franchise to create one of the better examples of the failing sub-genre with this rebooted origin story.The way in which the origin story of Lara Croft has been presented in this version is not that interesting compared with what was given in the 2013 game as the screenplay heavily relies on cliches and the tone is really inconsistent as it jumps back and forth between the fantasy tone of the classics and the grittiness of the reboot, that it becomes odd to watch at times.However, what makes this film better than the Angelina Jolie films and most other video-game films out there is that the screenplay does at least feel like a proper story that can entertain both fans and non-fans without alienating either and the action set-pieces, especially in the third act manage to incorporate elements of the gameplay within them such as the bow and arrow, grappling hook and puzzle-solving, without looking weird for people who don't play the games.Alicia Vikander, while not being as good as Angelina Jolie's more confident take on the character, does manage to get the look and the physicality of a mis-mash between the smaller 2013 Lara Croft and the more mature version of the original games right enough to be serviceable, while the likes of Dominic West, Walton Goggins and Daniel Wu do the best they can with their archetypes.Overall Tomb Raider may not be the best thing that the 22 year old franchise has to offer in terms of quality, but compared to what usually comes out for video game films on the big screen, being an OK film is equivalent to being outstanding in this sub-genre and one can hope that The Rock can overcome this hurdle with the upcoming Rampage film."
"126",1.5,"  not very exciting and did not explain how she solved any of the puzzles disappointing"
"127",5,"  makes me forget how bad I want an uncharted movie. I want more tomb raider now. (still want uncharted though)..."
"128",2.5,"  While Tomb Raider may have its appeal to the fans of the video games legacy, this new installment, just like in the past, fails in many areas, although not as badly. In particular, it comes short in it's somewhat meaningless plot and obnoxious action sequences. Additionally, the sound mixing could be better, there were parts of the movie when Lara Crofts (Alicia Vikander) grunts could be to clearly heard while she is running through the jungle and enduring gun fire. Junkie XL put together a decent original score, but even if it was as great as some of his other work like in Mad Max, it wouldn't be enough to bring this movie out of the tomb it's going to continue to bury itself under."
"129",1.5,"  Jolie dodged an arrow with this oneTOMB RAIDERWe continue to hope that this ""video game curse"" will be lifted by some divine spell that will come from the skies and change the whole panorama of this kind of movies but let me tell you that the only part that this has to do with witchcraft is the craft (or lack there of). You can't fake your way out of a lack of vision and a good eye, just as you can't fake your way out of a horrid screenplay. Tomb Raider belongs in that category of bad which comprehends any other movie you've seen and, granted you have the ability to percept repetition, you'll eventually forget. It's an extremely dull, mind-numbing piece of wannabe entertainment who falls into this modern pretence that tension isn't found in character, story or camera but in cutting 5 times faster than an audience's beating heart. And when you've seen many movies your heart starts to beat solely when a movie breaks out of the mold, when it shows me something exciting. In the end, when there isn't even an attempt to be original, you'll end up with a story which me, an experienced viewer, and even the general moviegoing audience will know by hard, bit by bit. Cinema, amongst other things, is about mystery, what you hide from the audience, so when you display all you have at once and all you have is an exact copy of the movie that preceded you, my compassion won't be won. Tension doesn't come from cutting but knowing when to cut. Action isn't a direct result of turning on a camera and shooting from 6 different angles and joining them together later, but from making decisions (tough ones). Maybe, when Lara is taking out a shard off her leg, instead of cutting 6 times, choose just one shot where the impact is unavoidable. If it's entertainment you want, make me feel entertained! I'll just end by saying that these are not the movies that will survive in a decade or so, these are the ones forgotten. And that is the only thing that is reassuring to me."
"130",3,"  The bar was low when I went to see this and while it certainly wasn't a masterpiece, I did find the movie to be relatively watchable and not as disastrous as reviews had made out. Obviously, the first rule of thumb with all movies of this type, is to suspend disbelief and once you do that you get a solid action movie. Alicia Vikander was surprisingly good in the role and supported well by the other actors, the action pieces were good and the dialogue while not highly original stuff, was not overly cheesy either. The plot was the real let down for the movie, it just wasn't strong enough. With a better plot, this could have been a better film."
"131",3.5,"  A gritty take on the popular video game character that does its best to capture the reality of playing the heroine in cinematic form."
"132",3.5,"  Although the story isn't that original or deep, for fans of the 2013 Tomb Raider game, this movie is a joy to behold because it stays exceptionally close to it's source material."
"133",4.5,"  If you like Indiana Jones movies, you will like this. I also like that Lara (Alicia V.) isn't a super sexy, vampy badass like her predecessor (Angeline) played her. She made the character more appealing, imperfect and believable for an unbelievable movie."
"134",4,"  It doesn't have the goofy feel-good vibes of Jolie's edition, but this was a lot of fun. Ignore the critical ""meh."" No video game adaptation has ever gotten good reviews."
"135",4.5,"  Alicia Vikander and Entertaining Action Set Pieces Help Tomb Raider Succeed.This incarnation of Tomb Raider is specifically based on the reboot of the Tomb Raider video game that came out in 2014. I have played that game and I came away from it being really impressed and hopeful for this movie (I picked it up on sale last year). So one of the things I was able to notice was how they did a good job of bringing in specific parts of the game and weaving them in organically. They borrow several of the action set pieces from the game and Lara uses the same weapons and tools. But the key thing is that they do it well and having played through the source material, they called back to it for the fans but you wouldn't be missing anything if you haven't played the game.Tomb Raider is another example of a project where casting talented actors and actresses makes the difference in making the material seem more believable. I initially thought Alicia Vikander was an odd choice for Lara, she's known better for acting in serious drama and this is a departure from that. But she nailed the role, she carried this movie instead of just slipping in as a cog. The supporting cast capably filled in their parts too. Dominic West was an improvement as Lara's dad over previous performances in the Tomb Raider series and he brings some genuine emotion and regret as Lord Richard Croft. I also enjoyed Daniel Wu as Lu Ren. I wish he and Alicia had a few more scenes together before they got to the island because they worked well together. The only disappointment was Walton Goggins and it wasn't his fault. He's such a fun actor to watch when he's on screen but he's so toned down it was like stripping a superhero of his powers. He's not bad, I just wanted a more animated Mathias Vogel and the character wasn't interesting enough for an actor of his calibre. I also want to credit Nick Frost and Kristin Scott Thomas for making the most of the material they're given to work with.Being an action/adventure film, the next thing that's on the checklist is that has to be there is some cool action. I wouldn't call this the next John Wick but Tomb Raider does have some thrilling moments. The beginning fight scene was a little choppy but the rest of it was fun to watch. The bike chase, the deserted plane and her fight in the jungle were all noteworthy and handled well. They lack the humour that something like Indiana Jones has but the set pieces are inventive enough and highlight this new version of Lara's strengths beautifully.I've been happy to praise Tomb Raider up to this point but there were some negatives that I'm going to point out. This movie could have benefited from some organic humour, Tomb Raider's jokes fall flat for the most part. One of the things that makes Raiders of the Lost Ark and the rest of the Indiana Jones series special is the fact that they can sell Indy as a bad@$$ action hero in one scene and in the next scene he's incredibly funny. A meta crack or two would have helped Tomb Raider float through some of the absurdity of the plot. The next and the biggest problem is that Tomb Raider can't parkour around some of the small plot holes as easily as Lara does around traps. From the motivations of some of the characters to the decisions that Lara, Richard, Mathias and Lu Ren make, there were some baffling choices. They didn't wreck the movie for me but they were big enough that I had to bring them up.I do want to finish by saying they took a unique turn with the ending that was pretty clever. A lot of movies in this genre are content to chalk things up to spirituality or magic when we get to the ending (the video game does but you don't mind it so much in the game). Tomb Raider takes a different direction with trying to being a little more practical and bring it closer to reality. This was definitely a nice touch and I appreciated that.Even though I would describe Tomb Raider as I movie I enjoyed instead of loved, when I was sitting in the theatre, I found myself wondering why we can't have more movies like it. I love adventure movies and while this movie borrows from the classics, they do some fresh things to separate from the pack. It seems like a genre that could use some more attention and I understand bringing in Tomb Raider to fill that hole. I think the cast and the action lift this movie over the problems the script has. If we're lucky enough to get another one (which isn't a sure thing, the box office returns for Tomb Raider so far aren't going to blow anyone away) hopefully they learn from this one. I still recommend Tomb Raider to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike."
"136",3.5,"  While not being the most original film with a predictable plot I found this reintroduction of the character to be thoroughly entertaining and engaging. I would very much be interested in returning to the cinema to see a sequel with an even more badass Tomb Raider."
"137",3.5,"  I personally enjoyed this movie and i thought it was a light in shining darkness for video game movies. The plot did take a stupid turn at one point but i thought towards the end that it redeemed that aspect of itself. Loved the main actress, didn't care for the supporting actor. He was good but his character was undermined and pushed to the side."
"138",5,"  You can't replace Angelina Jolie as Tom Raider, but I thought Alicia Vikander played the character great!"
"139",1,"  Blotchy transition. The cast has no acting ability except the ones playing Lu Ren, the man coughing in the jungle, the Croft business partner/ friend, the workers and some of the fighters. Lara Croft's actress can't pull off the lines albeit the lines are often so basic, cheesy, and virtually cut-pasted. She's just not suited for the role though she tries. She did have some good action sequences. The father seemed to have potential but upon meeting him at the jungle that seemed lost. I know that Tomb Raider games and movies are so fantastical it's exciting, but there is always that element of "" Ok if I were there I would have done this...or this..."" It's fantasy that allows us to feel as though it could be true if only for 1.5 hours. But not here. The jungle vines seem fake. The temple door has such a perfect circular cut in the stone after it was bombed open?!? And it couldn't be open with the bombs? And the people are on an island for 7 years when all they had to do was what they did in the end.... ? No one thought of that? The smugglers were going in and out often bringing in equipment and bombs lol... The father is some intellectual but a Moses looking dude while everyone else is pretty neat and clean? The queen comes up in a random Halloween booby trap... THAT was supposed to be the wow factor....Some of the computer effects: the boat crash, the airplane, the end run scene where fine but again not believable. Also couldn't the father just have cut his arm off???"
"140",5,"  This movie was much better than the critics thought it would be. Saw it with my 11-year-old daughter and she really loved it, too, although the dark tomb and music scared her a bit (due to her age). She found is as thrilling as the original Indiana Jones movie and liked seeing a positive female role model and would love to see this series continue. They should change the name, however, to Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, so they can launch a Lara Croft series of movies that aren't limited to tombs every time. Alicia Vikander also rocks as a realistic and extremely intelligent adventure hero. My daughter and I highly recommend this movie to our friends and family!"
"141",5,"  I Thought This Was a lot of fun and I Would Say This Was Dreaded Video Game to movie I Loved Angelia Jolie Tomb Raider a lot of fun, Simon West Film a lot of fun expect Sequel Tomb Raider Cradle to Life was ok wasn't bad but I Would Say This Is A Lot of Fun Movie Then To Tomb Raider Cradle To Life, I Thought Alicia Vikander did a great job as Lara Croft I Really Liked Her As Lara Croft Thank Goodness they hired Great Actress, Lucky for Me They Didn't Hire Rubbish Trash Actress But Alicia Nails Her Role. I Thought Story Was Really Good Close To Game I Don't Understand why does this Gets Hates for ? But It Wasn't Very LOW Rating to movie, But I Hope they make more Sequels Make More of them Without Destroying Them In Pieces Like Cradle to Life That Was Mostly Destroyed Sadly I Thought it was ok sequel but wasn't best as First, Story Thought went well in good direction movie entire doesn't slaright Forward Paced. This Has Nothing To Do With Angelia Jolie Franchise. This is Like Reboot Like To Any Another Movies Like James Bond To Different Franchise To Another In Here The Movie Focused On Lara Croft Early Days. Which Means The Movie Was More of An Origin Story of Lara Croft. Story Follows Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) makes a living as a bike courier, she trains MMA as well Witch I Thought She Should get Very Series for Her MMA Career. But Anyway Story Doesn't Follow MMA anyways, She Is Following the disappearance of her father Richard Croft witch Lara reluctantly accepts and Founds access to her father's office. There she finds a Pr-recorded Message from Richard Croft (Dominic West) detailing his Research Into Himiko, The Mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to Command The Power Over Life and Death. Richard Warns Lara to Destroy all of his research he has but Lara decides not to so she can Investigate Further. She goes to travels to Hong Kong she founds Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) Into the Badlands, captain of the ship Endurance his character play's Drunken Boat Captain That's How I Should Put It That Way he then Agrees to go for Adventure to Devils Sea to the island of Yamatai, The ship capsizes in a violent Crazy storm and Heavy Rain Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. she gets Rescued from member of Trinity's she wakes up and meets Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) Justified, Shield, Django Unchained, Hateful Eight. He play's really good villain in this movie I Would say he is a better villain to Ciar·n Hinds Jonathan Reiss witch i thought he was lamest Villain In Tomb Raider Cradle to Life, Mathias Vogel the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organisation called Trinity that seeks to harness and weaponise Himiko's power. he has all Prisoners digging holes to find Himiko. now this movie has a lot of fun action a lot of Adventure just like in game or should I Say action/adventure movie that will remind you a little bit of Indiana Jones ? Adventure style, I Don't Want to go further but there is surprised Twist of movie you don't see it coming, I Thought Action was a lot of fun just like Simon West Tomb Raider, it's pretty Watchable fun, Movie Breaks Long Dreaded Video Game It's Close To Game. Tend to Compare It With Angelina Jolie's version but this movie turns out to be they are both much better of Tomb Raider films then to Sequel Tomb Raider Cradle to Life. I Am Big Fan Of Angelina Jolie's 1st Lara Croft which was over-the-top But I Love Over Top Movies Depends Witch Over The Top It Goes For. It's Enjoyable But this one is more grounded and real for people who likes to look for realistic. to me i don't care what if it is Realistic or not but hey when movie is Unreal it's still great it's movie what do you expect ? If Movie is too Realistic then it would be BORING. That's How It Gets Entering for Everyone. I Am so Happy That Finally we got a motion picture well adapted from a game. If They Continue from Angelia Jolie Franchise then who knows I Might Like It But This Reboot is great. it's Largely Based on 2013 Tomb Raider game and Some Action Sequences Reminds me of Uncharted series. but A LOT DIFFERENT, I Thought Thing Is there is NO POINT HAVING Nick Frost in movie when he is in it like 4 minutes then at end of movie he is in it like less ? but anyway he doesn't destroy this movie. movie is not disappointing don't ever pay attention To Die Hard Game lovers this movie will NOT DISAPPOINT YOU believe me it's not really that bad of movie, The director was Roar Uthaug, a Norwegian film maker whose prior experience were directing Norwegian films. But I personally think he did wonderful job on the action sequences. but This movie needs more high voltage Action in this movie, but this needs more of action in it, but movie wasn't boring at all pretty watchable then it really gets to action, but this needs more amazing action like Simon West Flick. The special effects were good, and the CGI was done neatly & nicely. If you enjoy this kind of movie or if you are a fan of Tomb Raider games, then I think it would be satisfying. But if you want to see a lot of the tomb raiding scenes like in the previous Tomb Raiders movies, or if you are looking for the Indiana Jones quality, well this is not be too fulfilling. for you i give this 9.10 I Will Buy It On Blu Ray."
"142",0.5,"  WHERE TO EVEN BEGIN, THIS MOVIE tried to copy the plot of the tomb raider game from 2013 and failed. it was nothing but lazy writing as they copied himiko and yamatai straight from the game while still trying to add a twist to the story. These writers are nothing but talentless hacks because the story for both the setting and himiko were already taken and if they were going to put an entirely new spin on what himiko was they should have just made a new story. But they didn't, which shows you how pathetically untalented these people are. Some things to note: 1) They changed Himiko from sun queen to some goddess of death 2) they introduced an evil organization named trinity that seeks to control the supernatural, and that they hired mercenaries to get Himiko's power, which replaces the game's original idea of stranded madmen that knew that they were being kept on the island by an unnatural force and wanted to find an ancestral link in Lara's friend, Sam, in order to sacrifice Sam to Himiko so that they may be freed from the island (Long story very short).so they copied the game plot but removed lara's asian friend sam, which in the game, served to be the reason that lara pursued the villains of the island she was trapped on. Sam was taken and Lara, being a loyal friend went to save her; bringing Lara into direct confrontation with people trying to kill her and thus leads to the development of lara's fighting abilities. At first, she struggled with killing people, which was entirely reasonable as this is her first encounter with bad situations. The game lays out the foundation for Lara's development in both skill and character from the beginning, but the movie does not succeed in any character development of Lara at all. Instead, it was so condensed that we could hardly see a city girl develop into an explorer, and the main reason she went after the mercenaries was because her father was written into the script to be alive on the island and that he said some DISAPPOINTING things to her because she didn't burn his notes like he asked. Is that really the kind of motivation for a city girl with no background of violent encounters to suddenly risk life and limb and go toe to toe with ruthless mercenaries? no, it is not, and it's infantile and stupid.Next, we see the writers try to copy the game's original wound near Lara's hip, but that just makes the whole writing seem even more lazy. In addition, the ice axe was an important part of Lara's arsenal in the game, where Lara had to climb on multiple OCCASIONS and use it as a weapon as well. HOWEVER, the movie had decided to introduce it without Lara needing to climb anything serious at all. Instead it was brought out later (ALONG WITH THE USE OF THE BOW AND ARROW) as a marketing ploy to draw the connection to the game. Lara only used it once, and we didn't even see snow. There was no point for these mercenaries to have it at all, and out of all the weapons available, that was the most pointless one she could have picked. Next was her fight with the main antagonist, and she honestly threw her ice axe on the ground so that she could jump on a shaky ladder connecting the pathway into Himiko's chamber to the entrance of the cave so that she could go toe to toe with a trained mercenary. On this shaky ladder, she also decides to use plenty of kicks, which is stupid and pure nonsense. This might seem petty for a movie, but the whole point of the Tomb Raider reboot was precisely to be more realistic and show a vulnerable character grow into the explorer we all knew her to be, and neither the experienced Lara Croft, nor the inexperienced Lara Croft would kick someone while standing on a ladder hanging above their drop to the death. Of course, the whole fight scene was pointless as she drives the antagonist back from the ladder and in towards Himiko's cave only to kick the ladder down anyways. All of this pointless crap just to say the most eye-rolling catch phrases ever. Finally, their twist on Himiko was that there was nothing supernatural about her, that she was a carrier of a disease that killed anyone by her touch. Not only does this go against all the adventures of Tomb Raider, but unfortunately they introduced trinity as the organisation that seeks to control the supernatural; and they were active on Yamatai, looking for Himiko's power. So they introduce an organisation that seeks out the supernatural to increase their power and they merely introduce a disease, it simply doesn't work. Honestly, Richard's (Lara's father) description of trinity could be wrong, this would have been a nice twist, perhaps for a later installment after they introduced Trinity earlier on and actually introduced Trinity as an organisation that went after supernatural power only to uncover a disease; however, with a bare minimum introduction, the lazy writing and theft of the plot of the Tomb Raider 2013 game, I believe that the writers unintentionally contradicted themselves here. They are that bad. The writers should be fired for having no talent and sent to prison for their theft and destruction of a great story and character."
"143",5,"  Loved it. Not sure why the critics hated it. It was exactly what you would expect from a movie based on a video game. critics seem to all love obscure boring movies just to prove they are artistic and objective... but the fact that they think alike proves they are lemmings completely out of touch with the general public they are supposed to serve. tomb raider never stood a chance with critics."
"144",3.5,"  You know what? I liked it. At least a little bit. It doesn't have the same, campy fun as the original movie has, but it trades that out for a main actress with an amazing performance who isn't defined by sex appeal, and a story that, yes, has some structural and pacing issues, still manages to be faithful to the source material while being easy to follow and overall enjoyable. Would I recommend this to people who aren't fans or haven't seen the original? Eh, probably not, but I wouldn't say skip it or run away from it if you aren't interested. But if you're a tag-along to someone who wants to see it, I think you'd be surprised."
"145",3.5,"  quite impressed to be honest, the movie takes its time. it builds the flaws of Croft which is a total different tone then what we are used to from the orgininal movies. Vikander does an amazing job carrying this movie, there are some scenes where she blew me away with her acting. the one thing the movie lacks is as much action as I expected, I really hope this does well enough for a sequel because I really loved this"
"146",2,"  The acting is a generally cringeworthy, but some are better than others. Attempts at comedy & sentimentality miss the mark more often than not. Most big set piece action sequences are really good, (the bike chase through london was done well), but the chase through the docks is a pointless waste of screentime. Overall scene should have been allowed to play out in longer cuts rather than trying to needlessly build tension with fast editing and stupid sound effects. The hired goons that make up the army personnel are terrible, people are smarter than that and have more soul/personality.The Himoko story line was badly fleshed out, lara's father's obsession is bordering on insanity with little evidence as to why he is actually obsessed (fair enough your wife died, but get a grip man and move on - flashbacks are a cheap way to fill out backstory and don't work here)"
"147",5,"  Very entertaining. Good acting, good action, good stunts, all good"
"148",3.5,"  At just under two hours, Tomb Raider feels a bit long in the tooth by the time the credits roll, especially with the bulk of the first act feeling largely inconsequential, and the final ten minutes being devoted to laying the groundwork for an inevitable sequel. But the core elements - Lara using a combination of intelligence and athleticism to solve puzzles, outwit adversaries and navigate thrilling action beats - are superbly entertaining, and this outing may provide the film series with the same jolt of life enjoyed by its video game counterpart."
"149",3.5,"  Is tomb raider... actually kind of good? This movie had some serious pacing issues around the middle, but overall it extremely exciting and fun to watch, and it actually had a lot of tension. It was a decent movie in general, which for a video game adaptation is amazing. This is basically the Dark Knight of video game movies."
"150",3,"  I think Alicia Vikander is a great Lara Croft and I've really enjoyed the beginning with an inexperienced Lara in combat and without being the rich heiress, but someone normal; the problem begins with the development of the plot, which is simple and they don't stop explaining it again and again as if we were stupid to get it, the father and daughter scenes are repetitive, bored and they don't have chemistry for you to believe it also and this hurts me so much is that is a movie whose action scenes are very similar to those of the new video games (almost the entire movie) but the characters are horrible, the villain's motivation and evil are pathetic and there is no group dynamics with the sailor (I don't remember his name) I still do not understand at what point he begins to worry so much about Lara to the point of risking his own life ...It is a short and mediocre copie and paste of the stories and action scenes of both new video games but with mediocre and stereotyped characters, I miss the group dynamics that the characters of the video games or the old Lara Croft had."
"151",3,"  This was a movie I was looking forward too. I've always been a fan of the Tomb Raider games so it was great to see it back on the big screen. As origin stories come, it's a good character one but it falls into the usual pitfalls and cliches of an action hero, or heroine as the case may be, movie.Lara's father died on a mystery trip to find an ancient supernatural being called Himiko and Lara has been in denial since. In the 7 years, Lara has not accepted her inheritance because it means it would confirm her fathers death. There is so much emphasis on the relationship between Lara and her father and we are constantly reminded of it in the film. So much so that you could see what was going to happen, no matter how much I didn't want it to. Lara eventually gets to the island and low and behold, finds her father alive. This was something that really annoyed me. The origin of Lara is that she picks up her father's love of tombs and interests and carries on his legacy, something that can't be done if he is alive. By the end of the movie, Lara's father does die and in turn, she will carry on her fathers legacy but I felt it was unnecessary for him to be alive and something we have seen before.Another thing that we have seen before is the 'supernatural being' that will destroy all mankind if found so it has to be stopped. It did have interesting mythology and in the end, I enjoyed the twist that it was a disease and Himiko was sacrificing herself so it didn't spread. It was better than the VFX monster I thought we were going to get, but at the same time it did feel very general. For this type of movie, this is the standard type of villain or goal if you will, it didn't bring anything new to the table.Tomb Raider is far from all bad and it's shining light is without a doubt, Alicia Vikander. Vikander really brings the character of Lara to life and humanises her. There was always a risk that the character would be very 'video-gamey' and she would not fear death and be good at everything. With Vikander, you can see the fear and the growth in Lara. Lara isn't good at everything and she makes mistakes and by the end, when she is in her signature pony tail and double handguns, it does feel earned and satisfying. You can tell Vikander really threw herself into the role and she has to be praised for it.The one thing this movie had to get right was it's use of puzzles and problem solving. It's the fundamental basis of why Lara Croft is a well loved character. It doesn't delve too far into puzzles but we get a few at the end and it's great to see Lara figure them out and save them from the brink of death. The set pieces in which Lara flings herself to safety, although questionable that she could really jump that far, they are great to watch and it does ramp up the tension.Once Lara is back in London, it seems like Lara stumbles on a bit of a conspiracy in the fact that this big bad company is actually owned by Croft Industries and it seems to set up future movies. I wish it had started this through out the movie. Drop Easter eggs and throw away comments the whole way through, it would have felt worthy of a sequel then as there would have been more unanswered questions. It does seem like the last 5 minutes are a little racked on in the hope of a sequel.DIAGNOSIS - MINOR TO MAJOR SURGERYTomb Raider falls into the usual plot points of a movie, father is dead, then alive, try and save the world from virus, save world. If we can look past the story and focus of the movie, we do get a really compelling character arc and it's great to see Lara grow into the Lara Croft we love. Vikander alone deserves to explore this character more and I think it would be good to see a whole movie as Lara Croft being the confident Tomb Raider. I hope it gets a sequel but stay away from dead family members and supernatural diseases!Matt"
"152",0.5,"  Ok, so you know how everyone dislikes less flashy marvel superheroes and hates their mindless origin stories? So what we essentially have is an origin story of low-tier superhero. This unappetizing meal is garnishied by politically correct AND no-name casting. Entire movie is literally shots of some groups of men of random racial attunement, mixed up with attempts of our brave soldier Jane, the only somewhat redeemable character in the flick, to outplay them. The plot is beyond atrocious; nothing bad guys ever do makes sense. Same goes for acting. I was taking 2 year break from going to movies, and the first thing i see is this piece; the break was caused exactly by being subjected to a movie of a same caliber of quality, the Equals. Just my luck, i guess."
"153",5,"  IT IS AMAZINGGGGG and alicia did amazing"
"154",5,"  i thought this movies had great pacing, and was a really good revamp on the story. I really hope they continue this franchise."
"155",2.5,"  Despite some nice gritty action moments and Alicia Vikander's best efforts to portray a difficult character as Lara Croft, ""Tomb Raider (2018)"" fails to live up to the original game, all while delivering another midly entertaining yet forgettable film adaptation of a videogame."
"156",3,"  After a long plagued history of dogged video game movies, it's assuring to call this one at least ""okay"". Alicia Vikander fits into her action-loving character like a glove - and thankfully with zero female objectification. The effects and designs also deserve mention. Of course, the one thing that's always a problem, and it causes a lot of head-scratching as to why it is, is a plot with plenty of holes and flat characters."
"157",5,"  It was every thing I was hoping to see in a Tomb Raider movie. Action, adventure, some puzzle solving, and of course some tomb raiding"
"158",4.5,"  I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Being a mega Tomb Raider fan for the past 15 years now, I was worried how this movie would live up to the character of Lara Croft and her type of adventures (Alicia Vikander was an odd casting choice in my eyes). However, after seeing this movie, I can proudly say it holds the Tomb Raider spirit and effectively portrays the new Lara Croft. Vikander's small intricacies in her performance really sold me on her Lara. The story was interesting and full of tense moments, and the visuals were top notch. Many of the action scenes were genuinely gripping. I was a bit disappointed with the big reveal of Queen Himiko's powers towards the end, it didn't have the oomph I was hoping for.Overall, a fun, thrilling, well-acted video game movie that lives up to the franchise it comes from."
"159",2.5,"  D'AVANTAGE MIEUX FAIT QUE LES PR√âC√âDENTS FILMS AVEC ANGELINA JOLIE, ALICIA VIKANDER PARVIENT √Ä DONNER UNE TR√àS BONNE CR√âDIBILIT√â AU PERSONNAGE DE LARA CROFT MAIS MALHEUREUSEMENT, CE N'EST PAS ASSEZ POUR SAUVER COMPL√àTEMENT LE FILM QUI SOUFFRE D'UNE TROP GROSSE PR√âVISIBILIT√â SC√âNARISTIQUE ET SANS PRISE DE RISQUES."
"160",5,"  Super job by the new crew! Looking forward to the next one."
"161",3,"  Tomb Raider is a step in the right direction for video game movies, although a rather minor step; the movie plays it safe, avoiding being either dreadful or great. At least I can say it was mildly entertaining. A decade has passed since Angelina Jolie portrayed Lara Croft and now someone new is taking a stab at the role - Academy-award winning actress Alicia Vikander. Vikander gives the character a higher degree of authenticity; each grunt and scream that follows her colliding with a tree or doing something else dangerous actually sounds like it is coming from the actress. The sounds are not masculinized to obvious falseness and make Croft appear the vulnerable young women she is. Vikander's Lara still has the high-level of courageousness and toughness of the traditional character while still appearing genuine. It is Vikander's portrayal of Lara Croft that is the standout element of the film; the movie focuses less on the sex appeal of the character and more on the heroism she possesses. Walton Goggins plays the villain, ""Mathias Vogel."" While his performance is fine, there are flashes of intensity and intimidation from him here and there, the character himself is as bland as they come. Vogel is no more than the ""gun-toting psychopath"" the movie describes him to be. To call him a villain is even a stretch as the only true intention he has is far from evil since all he wants to do is leave the island and get home to his family. With a weak antagonist and an uninspired origin story, the film is both plain and forgettable. Lara Croft heads out to an island where she believes her father vanished, runs into a guy that likes to shoot people, and has to stop him from getting his hands on a supernatural tomb or else there will be astronomical consequences. It sounds like something you would get out of an Indiana Jones flick. However, Indiana Jones was great because its characters made the sometimes-cheesy plots entertaining. In Tomb Raider, there is only one significant driving force, and that is Lara Croft herself. The side characters lack value and as mentioned earlier, the antagonist does little to push Croft forward. Daniel Wu might have had a chance as a side character if he had been given a reasonable amount of screen time. The story and movie suffer from these faults. The latest Tomb Raider reboot is two hours long and yet only feels one-and-a-half; time flies by fast. The action scenes are cool no matter how exaggerated some may be. There is almost never any downtime. If the scene is peaceful one moment you can bet that something will happen to change that. I had a fine time watching Tomb Raider and believe if the writers can get a little more inspired there is value in creating a sequel and continuing the newest form of the franchise; but based on what I saw, I can't help but call Tomb Raider merely average."
"162",3,"  Alicia Vikander certainly makes this saga worth watching. There was more of a plot played out than what I was expecting. The action sequences are well choreographed, although some appear far more like a game than natural, which I suppose should be expected. It?s fun entertainment."
"163",5,"  I loved the grounded approach to the story. I think a story is always better when there is at least an attempt at plausibility. Tomb Raider delivers on that while still providing plenty of good action. I rather liked the background story, so I don't know what the critics are complaining about. It makes Lara a very real person that many people can relate to, not just some rich girl with a taste for action. Despite the rating by critics who almost always get it wrong, and fanboys who would have rather seen a big tit Lara, I highly recommend this movie!"
"164",3.5,"  Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft is a perfect combination of girl power and heroic action. This movie is living proof of an actually good video game movie."
"165",3.5,"  Actually we saw this a week ago, but I didn't post a review. This movie has a ton of faults but in the end we left feeling like we had been entertained and that's what counts.Alicia Vikander has the lead role and does a fine job. Lots of stunts, including four or five hanging by one hand over a something or other. She also has a Elf Quiver that never runs out of arrows. There is a lot to find wrong with this but in the end the characters are charming and the action is fun. Recommended as long as you don't get too picky."
"166",5,"  Tomb raider was amazing I was absolutely blown away it's cast was absolutely fantastic, it's plot was exceptional and it's action scenes and cgi was even better. The set up was great and so was the directing I felt it has way more potential than what everyone is saying. It was empowering and made Lara Crofts character even better than the originals. I hope someone decides to make a sequel because it's ending definitely made doorways to other movies. Overall I really appreciated this movie and all of its cast and I hope the ratings get higher cause in my opinion it definitely deserves way over 80%. It was a great action packed adventure with loads of exciting moments, this for me is highly recommend for all ages above 12"
"167",4,"  As a fan of the game franchise, and one who was very happy with the 2013 reboot, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. There were a few changes that had me scratching my head, but they were easy enough to get past. I would recommend to any fans of the franchise and those just looking for a fun action flick."
"168",5,"  This movie was pretty much what I wanted from a tomb raider movie. Also , probably one of the best video game movies in a long while."
"169",4.5,"  I watched the movie thinking i would be dissapointed but this movie is actually a pleasant surprise, the first half of the movie is the best part of the movie obviously"
"170",2,"  You know what you haven't heard enough about recently? That's right, identity politics, and I'll bet for movies in particular representation has hardly even come up. Well just leave it to me, a white, cis-hetero male to man-splain or, if you will, com-man-plain (?) about our cinematic paradigm and the shift that should be happening but isn't (even though it seems like it is). In the past year or two there have been a spate of films that have broken the mold for representation in Hollywood, and for all the avid audience members that cheer triumphantly at a particular casting decision or character trait, there is a white, cis-hetero man with tears welling up in his eyes for joy at the steady increase of his bank account. Ultimately, it's people like Kevin Feige who are on cloud nine when a movie like Black Panther dominates the box office, and people like Jim Whitaker who taste the pain when a movie like A Wrinkle in Time will most certainly fail.Admittedly, it is a cynical viewpoint to consider only the financial results of a film and who benefits from it the most. After all, Ryan Coogler will have a massive budget on whatever his next film is if he doesn't get resigned to the Mediocre-Superhero-Cinema-Industrial-Complex. He will probably cast as many people of color as he can fit into the movie because he can and probably should. As proven by the Oscars this year, Hollywood is a diverse, splendorous world where all are freely invited to spend their money. They have always had a one-size fits all attitude about what a film can be about and who it's for. Up until a few years ago, the size that fit all consisted of diverse casting, but not too diverse because they didn't want to alienate the WmiddleHaged,ImiddleTclassE demographic who frequented theaters the most.See, it's not just finances, it's marketing too. Since we've had a p(l)easant three decades of Reagan America's ""War on the Poor"", the dwindling middle class and the even more dwindling movie-going public have become the diverse melting-pot of ethnicities, races, genders, and sexual identities that we were told America is supposed to be all about. So it's no wonder that gender and race inclusive casting seems awesome in the cultural vacuum of the few people who actually still want to go to a theater and the film makers who need to make money off of them. However, it reeks of hollow lip service to pretentious assholes like moi. ""Think of the children"" one may retort, ""finally, they have heroes to look up to that look like them."" There's the problem: I don't like children - regardless of race, gender, and nationality. There are too many of them, the world owes them nothing, and they are annoying especially in a movie theater and most of the time on film.This is at the heart of my argument, there's a massive problem with the glorification of nostalgia and childhood. It allows film makers to be even more lazy with themes, dialogue, plot logic, and character development than usual. Nothing more is expected past a certain intellectual threshold, and it is childish in every sense of the word. Wonder Woman is strong and cunning, and that's it. Black Panther is strong and cunning, and that's it. It's not a new thing. There have always been these stoic and simplistic archetypal leads filling an anthropomorphic hole in their respective films, but that was before CG sucked the soul out of everything surrounding the Person with No Name. A constant upping the ante of fantastical environments has led to a clinical and critical shortcoming of major productions. These worlds and characters are transient thrills to fill a progressive atrophy in imagination. They are hot-button trigger words to trick you into aligning with a blank canvas of a character for reasons almost completely external to the films they inhabit as opposed to experiencing a fantastical world through the open eyes of a timeless character. They've overspent their value as pre-nostalgic set-pieces for the sake of a quick buck and at the cost of your attention. It's another superficial ""by the numbers"" decision to maximize revenue.It wouldn't be so bad if these characters had some insightful sense of depth. I'm not talking about an elaborate set of titles and fart-box MacGuffin swords they acquired on the magical Neptunian archipelago of Antarctica. I'm talking about real human emotion. I'm talking about strange and terrifying ethical conundrums that changed them as people, deep-seated regrets that haunt them at night, splendorous moments where they felt connected to something beyond love and thought - not fate and destiny and that one guy who died or that one guy who killed everybody that always seem to be the stand-ins for character motivation. Everything is spelled out unambiguously and simplistically because if an audience is left to ruminate about something too long, they will probably get out of their seats and trash the theater in a mass hissy fit like the children they are assumed to be. I feel bad for the races, genders, ethnicities, and orientations being represented in these movies because the audience they are meant to embody are being talked down to and sold short.Lara Croft, the titular Tomb Raider, is a woman who is overly capable of a decathlon, but most importantly, she is a pre-existing IP that is easily capitalized upon amidst our socio-political disdain for patriarchy despite the fact that every motivation she has is in service to or as a reaction to her daddy (who loves her, as we are reminded through constant flashbacks). The plot is a mixture of the vastly superior Raiders of the Lost Ark and the similarly crappy The Mummy (2017). This pisses me off because Alicia Vikander is a great actress who should be in more movies, but here she is given a boring, sexless, ersatz-empowerment role in a film where her character might as well have been played by a blue chimpanzee, or worse, Tom Cruise. I'm sorry if what I'm about to say will irreparably crush your nine year old daughter's dreams of becoming the President of Earth, but this movie sucks."
"171",1,"  Save your money but more importantly save your time.... that is unless you need a reason to fall asleep"
"172",3.5,"  A female-led action movie where is the woman is *NOT* an infallible, unstoppable ""badass""? How refreshing!"
"173",5,"  It was great, plot is not the best one out there but the overall direction and pace of the movie feels on point, Alicia made a stunning performance."
"174",5,"  Action packed and lots of fun!"
"175",5,"  This Lara Croft was fierce and the poor reviews don't do it justice."
"176",3,"  Entretenida palomera asÌ que le pongo tres estrellitas. ??"
"177",4,"  I feel this highly under-rated film, and I hope to see them do more with it."
"178",1.5,"  This movie was forgettable, uninspired and just plain bad. The only reason I'm giving this movie 1.5 stars is because I am a fan of Alicia Vikander - and lets face it she looks hot in this movie. Otherwise, this was just another really bad and seriously unnecessary reboot of a franchise that was bad in the first place."
"179",3.5,"  Tomb Raider brings back pieces of the best parts of the series while allowing itself to set new standards for the franchise on screen. Although, many of Lara Croft's motivations seem slightly uninspired and sporadic, it's still an exciting and entertaining experience."
"180",3,"  Alicia Vikander is great, there's some excellent action that reminds you of the game (in a good way) and there's a decent mystery/puzzle/trail making up the plot. It's got problems but there's lots to enjoy too!"
"181",3.5,"  Led by a strong performance from Alicia Vikander, Tomb Raider is a fairly harmless popcorn movie with glimmers of potential, at least whenever the story avoids the video game elements."
"182",2,"  Plenty of suspense, but this movie is inferior to the previous Tomb Raider movie series and honestly has some pretty boring scenes. I was expecting more from the actual tomb itself too. Those scenes fell way below expectations...eh."
"183",4,"  It was so much fun to watch this new lara croft reboot. I like how it starts at the very beginning. Even if you have never played any of the games your not missing anything. I am hoping for a sequel."
"184",4,"  I thought this was a really fun take on the Lara Croft story."
"185",3,"  Although it has some plot holes, it is still enjoyable"
"186",3,"  Stale characters and an incidental story weigh down most of the film, but its satisfying action scenes and strong lead performance makes Tomb Raider arguably the best video game movie so far."
"187",3.5,"  This movie step up with a new champion who added a grit and humanized the Lara Croft character. Alicia Vikander has brought to Lara what Danial Craig brought to James. You see he bleed and can feel her pain. She can get her butt kicked but pick herself up and kick back. The movie sets up the relationship with her father which will drive her in to sequels to be more the Lara that we know. I enjoyed the movie the narration and scrip could use some work and the plot was typical and predictable but Alicia Vikander is a Lara I can look forward to seeing again."
"188",4,"  My kids and I enjoyed this show. Fun entertainment. The plane and waterfall scene was suspenseful. Not as good as a Raiders of the Lost Ark but entertaining and fun. I am posting a positive review and we will likely see it again."
"189",3,"  While the storyline is generic, Alicia Vikander's performance elevates this movie above all other video game films. It is certainly not a masterpiece, but definitely a step in the right direction."
"190",4.5,"  I really like this movie, glad it is set up for sequel. It is a video game scripted movie and was really good at being just that. It was really entertaining, never slow. I would like to see this again in the theater, which is my measure of whether a movie is good or not."
"191",2,"  Never saw the original, so don't know if this version is better or worse. I did find it comical that Kroft is shooting arrows, while everyone else is using machine guns. She can hit her targets, while the guys shooting guns can't."
"192",4,"  Good entertainment movie"
"193",4,"  I actually really enjoyed this film! Vikander was a fabulous young Lara Croft and I appreciate the mix between film and video game. It was thrilling and smart. I will definitely be adding this to my Tomb Raider collection!"
"194",1.5,"  In 2001, Angelina Jolie brought to life a video game character and added a sense of humor, fun, and sexiness that makes these characters appealing. While the Jolie Tomb Raider movies are not memorable in terms of story, there is no denying that she made a memorable character. Alicia Vikander's turn at this origin story leaves much to be desired, not in terms of acting, but in terms of caring. We simply don't get to care enough about Lara because there really isn't much there to care about. As a result, we don't really care that much about the story, her relationship with her father, or whatever secret shadow organization is pulling the strings for the inevitable sequel. There are some great action sequences, but they run just a little bit too long, making them more of a chore to get through than fun to watch. Here's hoping that any future installments will be a lot more fun."
"195",0.5,"  This actress isn't good to be Lara we all deserve. Her rettagnle face just cant be watched for whole time od movie, i really regret i spend my money for this."
"196",5,"  I was extremely impressed by how well Alicia portrayed Lara. While the other films were amazing, they felt more like a video game (which they are) but this one feels more like a true action film to me! This movie makes me feel like I'm in the world of Lara and the other characters. I was amazed by the stunts. In an interview I briefly heard Alicia talking about doing stunts but I wasn't sure if they were done all by her. Props to whoever did them! They were amazing! Alicia can fill Angelina's position quite well and I'd look forward to seeing another Tomb Raider film or a film following Lara Croft."
"197",3,"  TOMB RAIDER- 66%Fun to watch. It was fun to watch Tomb Raider, however, i'm getting sick of these Hollywood blockbuster movies. The maze runner, Jumamnji, and now Tomb Raider are all so similar. I want to feel amazed as I was in Call me by your name. Story wise and execution: 1.7/3.5Acting: 2/2.5Camera Work: 1.7/2Sound: 1.2/2Overall Score: 3.3/5"
"198",4.5,"  Wonderful female role model. Good action, believable backstory and truly enjoyable all around."
"199",4.5,"  If you are a fan of the video game this is a fantastic movie... if not then its still a pretty decent action flick.. Alicia did a great job."
"200",0.5,"  It's Lara Croft, that watched and could not believe what this actress took on this role, they took replaced the Canon, it's not ""tomb raider, and some survival of"" okay game, but the film, we waited for 17 years that used here she played A. Vikander, where she for this role, it is not like, not canonical, is another issue Vikander is that it does not feel of aristocracy, rather, it is suitable for the role of Jessica Jones or Bella from ""Twilight"" or the heroine of ""the hunger games"", a kind of normal girl from a small American town (actually Swedish). There in her eyes no anger, no pain, no adventure, only anxiety tired rabbitIt's funny that the story eventually plays the theme of survival, which was stated in the promo for the game, but in reality the game was absent. To survive Vikander can, and to be a Lara Croft - is unlikely. ( to the actress I'm good, but that's not her role, it's a pity the petition never came to the bosses of the film). Lara Croft, which is not in different parts of the world riding and gets into different adventures, and survives almost the entire film in one location, I sincerely want that b was not continued and, God forbid, by 5 to 10 years will restart again with the Canon actress"
"201",2,"  Forgettable and boring. This Tomb reboot is undoubtedly action-packed and enthusiastic, but fails to deliver in the narrative, hanging precariously onto the missing father - pining daughter trope that was more irritating than endearing. Couldn't help pining for Angelina Jolie who looked more the part of Lara Croft than Alicia Vikander."
"202",3,"  Good but needs more fun"
"203",4,"  Really enjoyable, some unimaginative writing in parts, and lost the best characters from the game, it as it's own thing, It's a great movie"
"204",5,"  I didn't expect anything like Black Panther, and it was plenty good. Story was entirely predictable through the second half, but it was sufficiently fun to earn a bunch of stars."
"205",3.5,"  My ratings aren't polished in the least bit. Just a warning. Considering that it's a movie based on a video game, it's pretty good. The father daughter connection was definitely a great direction to take. I don't know what it is. It almost feels like I'm watching video game cinematic scenes sometimes. Objectively, this may not be the film's fault. Perhaps the mere fact that I know it's based on a video game unfairly colors my opinion in a negative way. Overall, it's a solid competent action movie. With a good attempt at balancing the action with character development and story."
"206",3,"  I went in with low expectations and ended up liking the movie. I think Vikander is great and I love her version of Lara. She's not just a physical bad ass, but also has human qualities and makes mistakes. She's also intelligent without being too clever. The plot was a bit boring and paint by numbers but some of the action was great. Overall not a bad movie."
"207",5,"  Idk why this movie had such bad reviews. It was excellent!"
"208",5,"  Outstanding movie in every respect, can't wait for the next one(s)...!!!"
"209",3,"  Vikander gives a great performance as an independent and strong-willed young lady. Certainly not a Mary Sue."
"210",4,"  Much better than the others. Nothing spectacular, but not a waste of money either. Good entertainment. I bet the series fan will not be disappointed."
"211",5,"  Super excited for more tomb raider movies."
"212",1,"  Just awful writing and stooopid ending: nothing to like"
"213",5,"  This action movie had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved it! I like that it is filled with lots of suspense and tense moments that make you feel as if you are inside the scenes. I love when a movie draws me in like that, because there are unexpected surprises. What also attracted me is the actors' work and the impressive way they portray the characters that make you feel as if you are with them and feeling what they are going through. The storyline and the actors combined make you forget what is going on around you and focus on the interesting film that is unfolding right in front of you. The storyline is about Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander), the independent daughter of an adventurer who mysteriously disappears for years. Croft embarks on a journey to find her missing father, in hopes to solve the mystery of his disappearance. She goes off to a weird destination she reads about in one of her father's journals and leaves without hesitation. Even though the destination is a tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan, she leaves with the drive to find out what happened to him. Lara must trust herself, mind, and spirit, to make it out alive of this adventure. My favorite scene is when Lara is stuck on the airplane and about to fall into a waterfall. This scene markes the moment when I most felt as if I was living this tough moment with her and the one that completely drew me. It is a complex scene where she finds herself at the top of a waterfall almost falling and then, finds an old helicopter that she can hold unto. She gets on top of the helicopter, but later realizes that the old helicopter is breaking down and she has to get out of there as soon as possible. Watching her go through all that without falling made me feel super anxious and nervous, as if I was in the scene with her. The important messages of this film are to never give up and to always fight for what you believe is the right thing to do. In the movie, Lara always has this drive to accomplish any goals she sets herself to complete. I think that is the secret for all challenges in general and all the objectives Lara reaches in the film. You need to believe in your abilities to achieve the goals you want and need to have the motivation that helps get you there. I rate this film 5 ot of 5 stars and recommend it for people from 13 years old to 18, as well as adults. reviewed by Alejandra g., kids first! film Critic.

"214",3,"  Female Indiana Jones light. Not good, not bad."
"215",3.5,"  A Lara Croft who's top priority is survival rather then looking cool. This is a mix of Katniss Everdeen and Indiana Johns. This is a movie that took the best things from the video games, and made into a cinematic experience."
"216",4,"  I lile the treatment they give to Lara Croft, she is no longer a walikung pair of gigantic boobs, she feels relatively real."
"217",5,"  An inspiring adventure that fulfills every expectation I had. Alicia Vikander, Dominic West, Walton Goggins and all the other actors seem to be made for their roles. Just as fresh was the harsh reality in contrast to the earlier Tomb Raider films, which is also due to the surprisingly unmagic but no less entertaining solution to the riddle of Yamatai. A classic masterpiece that draws you into a spell."
"218",5,"  I loved it! I am a huge fan of the games and in my opinion the movie was incredibly made amd pulse-raising even though the plot was completely different from the game it was based on."
"219",4,"  This film is an amazing adaptation of the new games, similar enough to exite fans yet new enough to surprise us. A lot of people are complaining that he body isn't as curvy as Angelina Jolie, but that's not the point of Lara, she's not a sex icon she's a powerful woman. As for the other complaints, it's an origin story and a brilliant one at that, the gun toting fully fledged acrobat Tomb Raider is clearly now set up for next time. I personally think this is the best game adaptation yet and loads better than the original Tomb Raider films that are only really popular because of physical attraction to Angelina's chest, as the story of that film is so weak compared to this one."
"220",3,"  A very boring first hour and a half, filled with uniteresting characters and senseless plot developments. The movie starts getting good at the final half hour, but by then is too late. Unfortunately, Lara Croft is not the feminist icon everybody wanted her to be. Alicia Vikander does a fine job, but it is not one of the best female action characters by far."
"221",4,"  In a genre dominated by men it's nice to know that strong women can be represented in the world of Archiological Mystery and Crime Fighting. But leave it to game makers to create a Bad-ass Barbie who still uses her over-sexed physique to get the job done. So when Hollywood came calling a decade ago it wasn't about ability to encompass a female version of Indiana Jones it was about who will pre-teen boys and gamers lust after that embodies the pixel-created Lara Croft? Jolie fit that mould perfectly. But 10 years later the world is different...or at least trying to be. Girls can be whoever they want. Woman are tired of being objectified. The age of Mad Men is past. A new Lara Croft can be imagined and she doesn't have to be tits and ass to get the job done. Alicia has the smarts and the chops. I'm going in to compare her to Jolie. They are not the same. As far as I'm concerned this is a stand alone movie with a cast that gets it done (albeit predictably). If you're looking for fantasy fodder grab a magazine of an unrealistic figure, if you're looking for strong female character with grit then grab a ticket and enjoy the adventure."
"222",3.5,"  more believable than the Jolie versions, worth a view"
"223",3.5,"  Having played the games, I went into this movie with limited expectations for it to fill out the wonder of its source material. I found that as a possible movie franchise, I can see the direction it took in an origin story for this character -however, as a lover of the newer game reboot, I found it somewhat disappointing in the character's development. In the game, Lara is very autonomous and her reasoning for wanting to travel is purely internal motivation and does not rely on the crutch of having to figure out what happened to her father (as if you play the games, you know exactly what happens to him). She is already becoming an established archaeologist in the footsteps of her father - whereas in the movie she is still trying to figure out who she is. By the end of the movie, she does develop a sense of self, and the movie evades any of the extra CG with the supernatural elements that was brought to the game itself and instead opts for a more realistic allure for what is going on the island. Despite all this, the lead actress does a pretty good job on the portrayal of Lara and fits the role pretty well. The movie also omits a lot of the NPCs and instead adds in a newer character that you pretty much... don't care about, wheras the game left you with a sense of connection with them because Lara had already made connections with those people, like one is her best friend from college. They also lead with Trinity right out of the gate, replacing them with the island cult and didn't really develop them much. On the plus side, the movie is full of action that reminds you of the game and you're left with a sense of game mechanics being fulfilled, as well as a very entertaining action piece - and you're still left wondering how Lara is surviving any of this by the end of it. Overall it was a pretty entertaining action movie with a lead actress - I just was left with wishing that she wasn't being portrayed as needing to be saved and having more of an idea of her self worth in all of this. Going forward, I hope that the next movies will be a more confident Lara and fill in some of the expectations I had going into this movie as far as her character is concerned."
"224",2,"  I hate when intelligent people makes stupid decisions"
"225",3.5,"  Tomb Raider was an relatively enjoyable movie. The movie tries to establish the character before rushing into the plot and does a decent job. The visual effects are interesting and well done with a lot of detail and interesting imagery. The problem was it felt like a compilation of other movie scenes recast with a slightly new angle. Like looking at yourself in an angled mirror, same image but slightly different. The building collapsing as the star runs out, doom feet away. A chase scene to regain a stolen journal with important facts. A secret society and a ruthless bad guy who uses local people as slaves. Insert just about any Indiana Jones or Mummy movie here and I would say you have seen it. In summary, I don't regret paying to see this, but I would definitely recommend you wait for this to come out on TBS rather than pay for it yourself,"
"226",2.5,"  Not sure it went anywhere. Lots of action but too many loose ends."
"227",5,"  Probably one of the best computer game to film adaptations I?ve seen."
"228",4.5,"  Attending a performance of the Edgar Wallace play The Case of the Frightened Lady later that day,I decided to go to town early in order to see a movie. Having found Alicia Vikander's film choices to always be at least interesting, and with co-star Walton Goggins The Shield being my favourite TV series of all time, I excitingly got ready to open the tomb.View on the film:Playing the two main men in Lara's life, Walton Goggins and Dominic West (Shane Vendrell meets Jimmy McNulty!) give fun performances as boo-hiss baddie Mathias Vogel and her reckless dad Richard,with Goggins firing up Vogel's years of desperation to find the tomb,and West bringing a joy out in Richard witnessing Lara follow in his footsteps. Leaping into the first raided tomb, Alicia Vikander gives an excellent take on Lara. Doing the hand to hand combat and running stunts herself, Vikander gives the action a real crunch with a fluid performance of each sweeping punch/jump. Set before Lara gets her hands on the family cash, Vikander brings out the vulnerability in Lara over the question of Richards disappearance.Inspired by the 2013 re-boot of the video game, the writers do very well at giving the origin set-up a lightness,as each piece revealed about Lara's childhood is pushed with the momentum of an adventure on the horizon. Going into Adventure Movie mode, the writers get Lara to face an exciting obstacle course, from Vogel's henchmen to fighting to avoid going downstream,and raiding her first tomb. Locking the tomb up with curses, the writers intriguingly make the main twist be a change in perspective on the reason for the tomb being built.Riding the wave of his Disaster movie The Wave,director Roar Uthaug & cinematographer George Richmond successfully adapt the video game with closely held camera moves giving the leaps in physics for the major CGI set-pieces a cover system atmosphere. Presenting Lara as a real sporty type, Uthaug and Richmond give the hand to hand combat scenes a rough and tumble mood, with crisp tracking shots following Lara's run to be the first tomb raider."
"229",2,"  A painted by numbers film with horrible direction; filled with shaky-cam, mudded cinematography and painful expository dialogue. Wasted potential."
"230",5,"  When I watch movies based on video games they tend to be a failure. But not this one. This movie is based of the 2013 reboot of the same name and I loved the similarities it had to the game, Alicia Vikander did a great job portraying Lara Croft. Great cast enjoyable story, and did not want to miss a minute of it."
"231",1.5,"  Angela was not ideal but this bitch sucks hind tit. Way too much SJW bullshit, way way worse than Angela. Horrible effects, completely loose control of the 4tg wall through poor plot, unrealistic character development. Umrealisyic little girl meandering around aimlessly without purpose. Shitty work in general. Stop the SJW bullshit already."
"232",5,"  Awesome movie. Very realistic. Lead actor was very powerful. This could be compared with what Nolan did with the first batman to portray him as a human being, in this movie Lara was portrayed as real human. Worth watching."
"233",3.5,"  Felt a bit lame on the scale of the National Treasure movies, but still enjoyable. Full of action and some spooky moments. Generally liked it. Is under 2 hours but drags a bit in the middle."
"234",3.5,"  A much stronger video game film than most, even if it's not perfect. Lara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father's global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he's truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can't understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death. Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad's last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn't be higher for Lara, who--against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit--must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.Having played only a tiny bit of the Tomb Raider games so far and avoiding the adaptations with Angelina Jolie, I didn't really have a lot of expectations going into this film. Alicia Vikander has been a personal favorite of mine ever since ""Ex Machina"" so I'm excited whenever I get to see her performance again. On the other hand, video games have a history of being, well, shitty. Thankfully, this adaptation really wasn't too shabby, and there's plenty of fun to be had with it if you let yourself.One thing that was great about this film was the talent themselves. Alicia Vikander really took control. It didn't feel like her character was ever objectified or sexualized so that was certainly a plus. Vikander really made a name for herself and seeing how this movie ended, we'll probably be getting a sequel. Thankfully, she did great in her role. She was accompanied by a strong Asian counterpart in Daniel Wu and as an Asian-American myself, it makes me happy to see Asians getting bigger roles in Hollywood. One thing that was absolutely terrible, and I mean terrible about this film, was the editing / action sequences. It was obvious the choreography wasn't too great so the film relied on the jump cut method. In a single move, there could be 5 cuts that just made you disoriented. When one punch is thrown, they have to cut 5 more times just to hide the choreography flaws. This fell into the pit that is poor action and if it wasn't for the entertaining story, I probably would've been annoyed rather than entertained. Honesty, this film is just simple fun. I think it's fun to see Lara Croft and the kind of person she is. The story is iffy and not the most coherent, but the film is fun. The visuals are decent, or at least good enough for the most part. It's got a solid beginning and a thrilling end, so if I wasn't having fun that'd just be personal preference. It was a fun time and certainly better than expected.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It isn't without its flaws but it was certainly good popcorn fun."
"235",4,"  I give this movie a positive review for Alicia Vikander's performance. Her Lara Croft is a bit more realistic than Angelina Jolie's. The movie had some tender moments like Lara discovering her dad. The story kept one's interest until the end which was ultimately unsatisfying as a plot resolution. I hope they make another one as Alicia deserves a better story."
"236",0.5,"  Esse filme È uma mistura de clich√©s e batatas. Vale menos que nada. Eu n√£o tenho amor √† vida e tou triste que perdi 2h de vida a ver isso."
"237",3.5,"  I really enjoyed this film! It's not wildly innovative or surprising, but it's a fun action movie. Vikander is a consummate badass and a joy to watch."
"238",5,"  I loved the film even if that's not an Oscar film. I enjoyed it a lot. Al√≠cia did a great job."
"239",2.5,"  Better than the original, but still a dull ""video game to big screen"" remake."
"240",1,"  I was very excited to see this movie but in the end I was extremely disappointed, I played the game that this movie was based off of and maybe that is why. I think the movie was too rushed and didn't have enough time in the tomb...wish they would have kept closer to the game it would have been much better"
"241",4,"  Personally I believe special effects were on point, even if situations were exaggerated. Tomb Raider brilliantly followed the storyline of the video game ??. Can't wait for sequel.??????????"
"242",4,"  It is an interesting take on the character. It bring more humanism and reality to it. On Most parts of the movie, it's perfectly paced. It also has many amazing action sequences. It's not a great movie, but a rather good one and it could possibly be called the best video game adaptation."
"243",2.5,"  a good adaptation about a video game? No, forgettable."
"244",4,"  A very well done reboot. Alicia Vikander performs brilliantly as a new and improved Lara Croft. Alicia's stunt work made The film feel even more real as you see her endure the events of the film. The story feels almost like a new age Indiana Jones film. The biggest downside was the one dimensional villain who is so forgettable I honestly don't think he even had a name."
"245",2.5,"  Tomb Raider is a reboot of the film franchise based on the recently rebooted game franchise, which it takes most of its ques from. The grounded approach is a welcome and some scenes were really enjoyable, mostly due to the great Alicia Vikander. But, the film is a bit boring up until they reach the island, then it turns into a knock off Rambo. I appreciate the world building though and I hope they get another shot at creating a film worth watching. Tomb Raider has nothing that stands out, which is a shame."
"246",1,"  Horrible. Plot was non existent. The star sounded like she was grunting on the toilet for 2hours. Do not waste your money"
"247",3,"  A film that tells a decent story. Not too thrilled, not let down. Vikander does a wonderful job!"
"248",5,"  Great movie. Just a good Action Movie to sit and turn your brain off to ."
"249",3.5,"  3.5 Star Review:I forgot I was watching a movie based on a video game while watching Tomb Raider. Granted, there were a few moments that reminded me it was from a video game, but overall, this movie definitely had a higher quality to it than other video game movies out there. Tomb Raider tells the origin story of how Lara Croft becomes the titular Tomb Raider. After many long years of having her father missing and presumed dead, Lara decides to finally sign the necessary paperwork that would grant her permission of acquiring her father's inheritance, including ownership of his company. After unlocking an ancient Japanese puzzle box left to her by her father, Lara uncovers a secret that leads her to a perilous journey into a fabled island off the coast of Japan where she believes lies the truth of her father's disappearance and where an ancient power has lain dormant for centuries.Alicia Vikander was a great choice in playing Lara Croft, The improved writing for the movie along with her acting combine to make for a more humanized Lara than the ones depicted in past movies. As an adventure movie, this film had me engaged from beginning to end and it had a satisfyingly enough ending that I am now genuinely excited for a sequel to be made."
"250",4.5,"  I really liked this movie. Alicia did an excellent job bringing Lara to life! Hope there's a part two!"
"251",3.5,"  Watched #TombRaider for Alicia Vikander. It was a decent reboot, but the franchise needs to work on differentiatiating itself from Indiana Jones. Looking forward to the inevitable sequel and more Vikander (3.5/5Scales)"
"252",2.5,"  I only watched this for Alicia Vikander's outfit, overall the movie was just forced and lacking story elements"
"253",4,"  Lots of fun. Half the critics are idiots, just like half of America is comprised of idiots."
"254",3.5,"  If you think about it as a stand-alone franchise then it's really good it build up backstory, it also sets it self up for at least one sequel. One big plot hole is that the ""villains"" were owned by mr Croft so surly he could cancel all funding to said ""villains"". But all in all a good film just big plot hole"
"255",5,"  Finally a video game adaptation that feels like the people who made it actually played the game. While trimming the story down to fit in a movie they managed to keep most the elements of the game. I didn't like how they basically switched Roth for Lara's Dad but I understand why they did it, to add a bit of emotion to it. I understand why they added the story on the start but personally I would have liked to see this part trimmed down a bit in exchange for more time on the island.Overall I think they did a great job and can't wait for the inevitable squeal."
"256",3.5,"  Loved The Story But The Movie Was So Fast."
"257",3,"  Can't lie, slightly disappointed with this one. I had higher hopes for a better story line. While Alicia Vikander was solid in the role as Lara Croft... the story felt somewhat flat and uninspired. Still enjoyable... but I had higher hopes."
"258",4,"  I couldn't believe it until I saw it. They actually made a video game movie that's genuinely good. Mortal Kombat is good in that ""cheesy 90s"" way, and other video game movies have been watchable, but none of them were actually great. Tomb Raider may not stray far from the origin story formula and it does suffer from some of the same problems as other movies based on video games, but it more than makes up for it. Alicia Vikander embodies Lara Croft better than Angelina Jolie ever could, and like a female video game version of John Wick, she bucks most of the typical action hero cliches in the process. Instead of always being victorious, she loses fights. When she goes crashing through the jungle, she doesn't have perfect hair upon landing. Rather than being invincible, she gets hurt, and those injuries have lasting effects. What's more, she shows real emotion. When facing extreme danger - whether it's falling hundreds of feet, trying to escape a ship that's breaking apart, or crawling on and through a 70+ year old crashed plane - she shows genuine fear. Most importantly, like Superman in Man of Steel, she actually has a realistic emotional reaction when she is forced to kill someone. Additionally, Dominic West (is it just me or does he look a lot like Hugh Jackman?) does a great job as Richard Croft, and Walton Goggins puts his own spin on a slightly unhinged guy who's willing to kill so he can see his family. Overall, Tomb Raider is genuinely great, and arguably the best video game movie so far."
"259",1,"  This was the worse of the Tomb Raider Movies. After waiting years to see father for years her stupidity caused her fathers life."
"260",5,"  This was GREAT! Loved to see Laura Croft as a real Woman Kicking Butt! It's as if Laura Croft and National Treasure mad a baby! Loved it!"
"261",4.5,"  Looking for a good film with non-stop action, thrills, adventure, suspense, and a sexy leading actress? Well you've landed on the right movie!"
"262",0.5,"  A really boring & rubbish film"
"263",5,"  Seriously forget about paid movie critics, they're all useless garbage. This movie is great. Great acting, direction, and story. Seriously...burn Rotten Tomatoes to the ground. Paid movie critics are Disney/Marvel whores, hang them from street lamps. This movie is great."
"264",5,"  Amazing!!!! correct archery technique, athletic lead that can actually do stunts, epic choreographed fights that you can actually follow (real MMA technique with few cuts = authentic work). on top of all that you get a story that is killer, liked it way better than the video game one, totally will blow your mind go watch it!!!"
"265",3,"  Achei um bom filme de aÁ√£o. Agrad√°vel, divertido e com boas cenas de a√ß√£o. Mas sinceramente, gosto t√£o mais dos jogos que sei l√°... N√£o gosto do primeiro ato. N√£o gosto do vil√£o e nem dos ""ajudantes"" da Lara. Acho um filme nada original. Ele vai seguindo muitos clich√™s e conven√ß√µes. Mas os di√°logos s√£o decentes. A Lara t√° √≥tima e, como eu disse, as cenas de a√ß√£o est√£o excelentes. Recomendo, s√≥ que sem muitas expectativas, por favor."
"266",3,"  This was the most inconsistently I've ever enjoyed a movie. I think I finally get what every guy feels when they watch a Star Wars or Marvel movie - you're so happy to see the characters you love doing the things they're famous for that you almost forgive its entire lack of a coherent plot. I don't think I'd recommend this movie unless you're a hardcore fan of the franchise. But for me, I have played all the games on PC and systems and I was so happy to finally get a female video game heroine when I was young. As a fan, I was perplexed by how they tried to fit in old tomb raider and the new survivalist tomb raider. I was annoyed that they included the campiness of the old games with the aesthetic of the new. All of the physical aspects of this tomb raider were STELLAR though, and they took painstaking care to make all of the stunts physically possible, but they forgot to make the plot possible. I still fangirled hard in places, and overall I thought it was a good attempt. I want to see Alicia Vikander in more movies, because, despite the awful writing, she kicked ass - way more than Wonder Woman. For what it's worth, I haven't believed in a woman's physicality this much since Terminator 2. The action, stunts, and Alicia Vikander were great, but the writing was ridiculous. I personally would re-edit the film with ONLY Alicia Vikander scenes."
"267",2,"  Probably one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Alicia Vikander's performance. As for the rest: uninspired and nonsensical plot and flat characters, let alone the nonsensical plot twist."
"268",5,"  A great popcorn-movie! Not a perfect movie by any means, but Alicia Vikander is charismatic as ever, and carries this movie on her shoulders. Great fun with friends :)"
"269",5,"  Really fun treasure hunting outing with the pitfalls, puzzles, traps and a neat legend. Also, we got an actress who is fitting for the Lara role."
"270",0.5,"  Epic fail. Why would you want to watch a movie where there is no bad guy? And no being forced to leave on an island and work for the bad guys, doing what they pay you to do so you can one day go home to your family, doesn't make you the main bad guy, it makes you a goon."
"271",5,"  It's much better than the other two I like the new girl she is more serious the best tomb raider movie ever I hope there is another"
"272",2.5,"  The plentiful and artistic stunts and special effects could not overcome a story that made no sense whatsoever. Spoiler alert! Try this out... Evil contractor labors 7 yrs in the jungle for evil organization to find the source of a disease that can wipe out humanity. They want it's power. The evil contractor doesn't believe in this power. Doesn't have any resources to harness this virus let alone transport it safely to whatever the evil organization is (shown at the movie's end). It's quite idiotic. As the intrepid and evil explorers trek to the middle of a mountain as their path is constantly destroyed right behind them by countless ridiculously complex booby traps, no one seems concerned about how they will get out once they they find their destination. Don't worry, Lara makes it thru everything with only a forehead scratch and a lot of body smudges."
"273",4,"  A very enjoyable movie, not sexualised, not overly cliched and suprisingly good for a movie made after a video game."
"274",4,"  They should have invested some time and effort in the script. It was very linear and predictable. There were no surprises or plot twists. Action scenes were OK. Overall its a decent one time watch."
"275",1.5,"  While the action sequences are satisfactorily thrilling, they are strung together by a boring story and often agonizingly stupid plot."
"276",3,"  A ""6"" is pushing it. It could have been far better, but it's only average save the screen debut of Daniel Wu as Lu Phen. Wow!"
"277",4,"  Solid story. Better than any of the previous Tomb Raiders."
"278",3.5,"  The cast are awesome but there were some cringy and cliche moments. Movie is worth the money."
"279",3,"  A decent action movie, predictable and forgetable. Watch it if you want to turn your brain off for two hours."
"280",3.5,"  A decent adaptation of the video game just pretty forgettable. Vikander throws herself into the role and makes a good Lara Croft and I?d be interested to see where the franchise can go from here"
"281",2,"  Death and taxes are not the only certainties in life, as Benjamin Franklin famously asserted. Another certainty is that video game movies are always bad, but that is not a lesson Hollywood has learned. If anything, they seem to be doubling down on video game movies by giving Tomb Raider yet another shot. The result is by no means the worst video game movie, but it's still a pretty bad one.The inescapable core problem of Tomb Raider is the same as every other video game movie: going from the interactive experience of a game to the passive one of a movie is inherently a step down. Sure, Tomb Raider features the same mechanisms, visual style, and sound effects in its puzzles and death defying stunts as the game. One scene in particular was ripped right out of the game. Watching Lara Croft pulling them off, however, is nowhere near as satisfying as doing them yourself. As is, the action is pedestrian, but compared to the game's combat, it's downright boring. That the movie intrigues me more with the fast-paced lives of London couriers than the actual tomb raiding is an early bad sign.If it's unfair to judge this film by video game standards, then allow me to inform you this movie isn't that much better from a pure film-making perspective, either. The lighting alone is atrocious, especially during night scenes. They are so poorly illuminated that they strained my eyes. Worst of all is the thunderstorm scene. The filmmakers' idea of simulating lightning is to rapidly flicker the lights on and off. This extremely uncomfortable technique drags on for so long, there should be a warning in case it triggers an epileptic seizure. At least the movie's unconventional camerawork manages to impress. Each shot rarely gets followed up by the logical next camera angle, while the 180 degree rule shrinks to more like the 120 degree rule. For a style that plays fast and loose with the rules of cinematography, it is quite a feat that the action remains visually coherent.Granted, video games are about much more than game-play, and this movie, based off of the 2013 reboot, has a story to tell. If Tomb Raider was an earnest attempt at adapting that story for a wider audience, it would probably be a much better movie. Instead, it ends up another attempt to kick-start a sequel, so the most interesting elements of the 2013 Tomb Raider's story are replaced with franchise tropes. The entire supporting cast is swapped for a pair of less interesting characters. To the movie's credit, each character is well-acted enough to distract from how two-dimensional they are. Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) definitely looks the part for Lara Croft, and she brings the tough, quick-witted attitude Croft is known for, but her Croft lacks the character arc that made the game's story so good. She begins the movie close to mastering her talents, getting all but the bare minimum character development out of the way. It's hysterical that one of her nameless friends what appears to be a Mass Effect jacket, because the writers reduced an interesting journey of a sheltered college student thrust into becoming a hardened survivalist into Daddy Issues: The Movie. The main plot begins with a pair of cliches that only get compounded. While this movie commendably portrays what kind of punishment the human body can take better than most of its peers, it only does so to a certain extent. A named character can take a gunshot to the back of the shoulder, but the exact same injury kills an extra instantly. The game's twisted villains are now part of a generic shadow organization. Tomb Raider is such a transparent reenactment of Indiana Jones, that the main villain is even named Vogel, just like the Nazi in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Moviegoers who never played the game might not notice a lot of this movie's flaws, but if you want to experience Tomb Raider in the best way possible, the game is still the superior version in every regard. It has more content than this 2-hour film. Its interactive nature makes the action more enjoyable. Visually, the game is far more stunning, especially the remastered version. The story, by Rhianna Pratchett, whose father was the late great author Terry Pratchett, is quite well-written, too. Plus, the game has been out so long, you could easily buy it for the same price or cheaper than a movie ticket, and get so much more bang for your buck."
"282",4.5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's easy for the critics to come down hard on the story, but the writers were simply modifying the storyline from the game to fit a film. Overall I think they did well. Alicia Vikander does an excellent job playing a much more believable Laura Croft, and despite my original with a Swede playing a Brit, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role now."
"283",4.5,"  This movie is the adaptation of the video game Tomb Raider (2013) which itself is a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. And so the movie takes you on Lara Croft's first adventure: to find her missing father and to solve the mystery of the Death Queen Himiko. This movie stands well on its own as a solid action thriller. There are several fight sequences throughout the movie, all of which feel very kinetic and very physical. Alicia Vikander's commitment to the role shows really well. The element of mystery regarding Queen Himiko is also handled quite well. But the movie also has its share of flaws, such as a weak villain and a general lack of emotional investment. This could be attributed to the quick pacing of the film, which covers a lot of ground in terms of Lara Croft's development as a character. Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch for its action sequences and Alicia Vikander's performance as Lara Croft."
"284",5,"  BUENISIMA !!!!!!!!!!!! YA ERA HORA Q REEMPLAZARAN A A JOLIE, ALICIA SI Q SABE ACTUAR Y ES MUCHO MAS LINDA...NOSE XQUE SE HIZO FAMOSA JOLIE"
"285",2,"  Putting aside whether there is any demand or need to reboot the Tomb Raider franchise (the answer is probably no, by the way), this is a very pedestrian production hampered by a predictable and unimaginative script, and this is despite a wasted Alicia Vikander who has presence and does her best with the materials she is given. The only thing I can say in its favour are a few set action sequences which are decently mounted - the bike chase and the rusty jet carcass over a waterfall scenes are nicely done and provide a few thrills in an otherwise dull and unimpressive film in which characters bumbles from one perilous situation into another with little preparation or skills that make any logical sense. Out of the two so-called 'twists' in the script, one is so obvious I don't think even the most naÔve of audience will be shocked by it and the other is just so random, it's laughable and is optimistically put there just to set up future sequels. A British supporting cast comprising of Dominic West, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Derek Jacobi looks awkward as if they are slightly ashamed about picking up their paychecks and by the time the film reaches its final act, I honestly believe that the only tomb they've raided is that of Indiana Jones's as it turns into a shamefully sub-standard rip off of the Raiders of the Lost Ark."
"286",4,"  I completely enjoyed this film. It is visually stunning and well put together."
"287",5,"  Saw this movie at the European premiere, I've never been interested in video game movies because they usually sucks. I am a big Tomb Raider fan and didn't like the two Angie movies but this one is a huge step up! The actress is incredibly talented, same as the supporting cast. The director did an amazing job! The story is pretty good, I espec loved the london parts cause the scenes are really intense in term of character building. The island scenes are really good too but I really really loved the third act in the tomb!!! I really recommend this movie to fans, people who didn't like the trailers (They showed the wrong tone of the movie), and people who've never Played the game too!"
"288",2,"  I should preface this review by stating that I am not a gamer. I've never played the ""Tomb Raider"" video games, but like many, I'm familiar with the character of Lara Croft given the two previous movies. The video game got a reboot in 2013, which apparently means that a movie reboot was the natural next step. This iteration finds Academy Award winner Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) as Croft. We learn that at a young age, her father (West) left his family to go in search of a hidden ancient tomb belonging to the Japanese Queen Himiko. It's been years since her father has been seen and is now presumed dead. Lara is strapped for cash, yet is leery about signing over the death papers, which would in turn give her his inheritance. She ultimately decides to sign the Declaration in Death papers and as part of the process is given an ancient artifact leading to a hidden basement of clues, texts, papers, and notes her father left behind. Her father's dying wish was to have his files on the Himiko case destroyed. She's too intrigued by what she finds, and disobeys his orders. Her inquisitive nature leads her to Hong Kong to finish her father's work. Lara learns the hard way that he wasn't the only one looking into Himiko's tomb when she's taken hostage by the Trinity group led by Mathias Vogel (Goggins).If the premise seems a bit generic, that's because Tomb Raider has that general quality about it. This isn't the Lara Croft type of movie we're used to as this iteration decides to tell the origins story of the character. Do we really need this? I'm so exhausted by origin stories. The new DC Extended Universe made the same poor choice with the Ben Affleck Batman. I think we could have rebooted the Lara Croft franchise and gone the James Bond approach by just casting a new actress and given her a fresh mission to go on while incorporating the father angle.The casting of Alicia Vikander is a daring choice as she doesn't quite fit the design we're used to seeing of the character from the games. I want to be clear though that it's not a bad thing despite the image people may have of her in their heads. Angelina Jolie originally played her and has the stature and masculinity typically associated with the character. We see Vikander's Croft trying to find her strength throughout this film. She's not quite the fighter we've come to expect. Vikander brings a softer edge to the character, which fits the origins/pre ""Lara Croft"" side of the character. She's a strong enough actress to carry this version of the character representing the everyday woman who, in this case, has distanced herself from her family's past but is now forced to confront her legacy. Vikander can also pull off the intelligence of the character as we find out her father's knack for solving clues and riddles has been passed down to her.A big film like this should be an action juggernaut. The first initial sequence follows Croft in a ""Capture the Flag"" style bike race through the narrow streets of London. It's a pretty slick chase that's one of the more exciting moments in the movie. Croft is a speedy character whether it's by bike or by foot. Too much of the rest of the action relies heavily on CG effects, poor CG effects to be exact. It begs me to wonder if the film's budget wasn't high enough to pull off what was asked for or if the stunts and tricks are too elaborate in the first place. I had the same conundrum while watching A Wrinkle in Time. It feels more aligned with The Mummy than say Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's missing the fun and humor that came with Indiana Jones. I get that they're different characters, but I want to feel the exciting thrill factor. Tomb Raider takes itself too seriously and isn't deep enough to find the mystery or urgency present.This is the biggest film to date for Norwegian director Roar Uthaug. I can't tell if the movie is attempting too much or too little. Is there too much going on with trying to reboot a franchise with an origins story and a new actress? Everyone involved is trying to make an exciting action film to be respected by the gamers who have invested countless hours with the character. At the same time, there's too little going on as the story and the characters are lacking any sort of creativity. I'm not a gamer, and I barely know Lara Croft from any other game, but even I don't feel a need for an origins story. Tomb Raider has a few good things going for it mainly with the leads. Alicia Vikander has the potential to make for a whip-smart Lara Croft. Walton Goggins, who was excellent in The Hateful Eight, is always reliable as the bad guy. He's sleazy and vial and just what is needed for this kind of movie. The ending leaves the impression the studio wants to create a new franchise as Lara realizes there are more secrets and skeletons in her father's closet. We start seeing that shift from innocent Lara to vengeful Lara. I'd be curious as to what Vikander will do with the character, but I wouldn't be saddened if a sequel didn't happen.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Only for Lara Croft enthusiastsRATING: 2 out of 5 TICKET STUBS"
"289",5,"  Video game genre win. I'm a hardcore Lara/Tomb Raider fan. While they messed with the story to get the 16 hour game time down to 2 hours for a film. I really think it was execute d well. They'll have to do better with a sequel however I give this film a 5 star because everything was going in the right direction and the faults of dealing with a huge story over the span of 2 hours was done supperbly."
"290",5,"  Loved the game, nice to see the movie tryingbuild in key elements of the game!Solid performance by Alicia, and very believable as Lara"
"291",0.5,"  Was falling asleep 20 mins in. Suffered through an hour then got up and left. Movie seemed thrown together."
"292",1.5,"  I like Alicia Vikander. She is one of our best young actresses. After starring in the excellent ""Ex-Machina"" and winning an Oscar for ""The Danish Girl"" she now heads to this? It's not progress. This is not the path for a good actress to take. The film is one miserable cliche after another with overblown effects and tired action. The one thing it proves is that a movie with a female action hero, can be just as ridiculous and mindless as the ones with a male hero."
"293",3,"  it's fine, it's like a live action video game cutscene"
"294",3,"  It was pretty much a formulaic treasure hunter movie. Exotic place, bad guys with guns, riddles that need to be solved, booby traps, ancient building that collapses and the protagonist barely gets out alive."
"295",3.5,"  I think Alicia Vikander is the best Lara Croft yet. I never really liked the old Lara Croft games (90's) PS1 or Angelina Jolie movies. The new Tomb Raider games and this new version of Lara is far better IMO than any previous iterations.This movie is based on the Tomb Raider game reboot (2013) that takes place on Devils Island. Great story and Alicia Vikander is great in the role. I gave it a high review. I have been a fan of Alicia Vikander since her role in Ex-Machina, she does a fantastic job in this roleI enjoyed her character developoment through the movie, she goes from being a Daddy's little girl, challenging him when he falls short. The rest of the characters including the villain seemed one dimensionalthey could use some improvement for the sequel. I will definitely support this franchise in the future. I lookforward to the next game and movie.?"
"296",4,"  Good action movie; Vikander makes a good Laura Croft. Hope it continues to another movie! :)"
"297",5,"  I was at the cinama today and yes i have played the old Tomb Raider game's and the New one's as well , so now i watch the movie , the new Movie Tomb Raider .....

"298",4,"  I recognized scenes from the 2013 Tomb Raider game. Great Lara Croft , I will definitely continue to support future movies."
"299",4,"  Fun movie, not too deep but enjoyable. The action was very reminiscent of a video game."
"300",1.5,"  The movie started out ok, but at the end of the day was slow and boring. If a little of this plot could of been in Jolie's film and some of the action from that was in this, it may have been enjoyable."
"301",5,"  I Like the New Lara Croft. I'm glad there was not as much emphasis on the body, and more on the action and wit. We went to see this last Saturday with our friends on IMAX and we were not disappointed."
"302",3,"  March 16, 2017Anyone going into ""Tomb Raider"" (2018) will (hopefully) not be expecting cutting edge cinema. It is, after all, just another fantastical adventure story along the same lines as the ""Indian Jones"" movies, ""The Goonies,"" and, well, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider."" Yes, this is a re-imagining, if you will (it's not exactly a remake), of that Angelina Jolie vehicle from 2001, which was the first filmed incarnation of the popular video game franchise. And just like Indiana Jones, the heroine in this series is a resourceful archaeologist, although at the beginning of this movie she doesn't officially have that title. Even so, she embarks on a quest around the globe to find a supernatural historical figure, while simultaneously using her wits, unique athletic abilities, and trusted bow and arrow to battle and thwart evil men.Because ""Tomb Raider"" hardly brings anything new-neither concept, character nor narrative-wise-to the action-adventure table, its success depends heavily on the likability and enthusiasm of its star and whether we can get behind her in spite of a lackluster plot and mostly traditional action sequences. Luckily, Alicia Vikander is not only physically capable as Lara, but her sympathetic expressions and genuine emotions bring an unexpected depth and vulnerability to the role. She's not just a pretty face and so we end up getting more out of ""Tomb Raider"" than we initially anticipated.I used lackluster to describe the plot, and it is, but that's not to say it's bad, just ordinary. It simply serves, like most plots in movies of this nature, as a clothesline on which to hang over-the-top action sequences, such as a road bike race along the streets of London; a foot chase across parked boats in a fishing harbor; a giant sea storm; a downhill mountain pursuit that ends with Lara falling in a river and hanging onto a crashed plane that sits on the edge of a waterfall; mighty leaps across pits; jumps and slides on stone floors to avoid booby-traps; and of course, more than one instance in which Lara gets to show off her mixed martial arts skills, including a direct hit to the villain's family jewels.Essentially, the action sequences are the plot, since they take up most of the screen time. The other minutes are filled with a basic back story and introduction to Lara, a carefree twentysomething and borderline ne'er-do-well who, despite being the heiress to her father's massive fortune and the Croft family manor, often lives hand-to-mouth as a courier. When she's not delivering packages, she's either kickboxing or living recklessly one way or another. Following her latest run-in with the law, Ana (Kristen Scott Thomas), the overseer of her father's estate, tells Lara she has to finally accept that her father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), is dead, and if she doesn't claim her inheritance, she runs the risk of losing it all. But Lara isn't convinced her father is really gone. Years ago, Richard, an ""official"" archaeologist and seeker of truth, embarked on a mission to find the lost tomb of Himiko, an ancient Japanese queen who ruled with black magic and had the power to inflict death with just a touch of her hand. Later on we learn exactly why Richard sought Himiko's sarcophagus (it's not a huge twist, but I'll refrain from spoiling it), and once Lara uncovers specific instructions from him within a Japanese puzzle, she starts her own search for Himiko, hoping that maybe she'll also find her father. Lara's journey starts in Hong Kong, where she partners with Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), son of her father's travel companion who also went missing. They eventually make it to Yamatai, the island Himiko once ruled, and here they face the merciless Mathias Vogel (Walter Goggins), who claims to have killed Richard in order to exploit his research. Without giving too much away, although it doesn't really take a genius to figure out how ""Tomb Raider"" will play out, Lara must escape Vogel's clutches and prevent him and his cronies from obtaining Himiko's power and using it for evil. If the plot sounds familiar, it should, because it's essentially the plot of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which created the template for other movies in this genre, including ""The Mummy"" and ""National Treasure."" Ideally, the makers of ""Tomb Raider"" would have sought a more original story to place Lara in, but nevertheless, we go along with it. Besides, the real reason to see ""Tomb Raider"" is because Vikander is so charming and passionate. We root for and ultimately care about Lara because of her, and what's refreshing is the way the screenplay paints her not as a superhero type, but as someone who's vulnerable and still has a lot of growing up to do. Vikander herself is not yet 30 and, as Lara, she comes across as a kid, still shaping herself into the warrior we know she'll become (which is where Jolie's version started off). For now, though, she gets hurt, makes her share of stupid mistakes, and has a hard time accepting she doesn't know everything. If there's a sequel, I believe Vikander could make Lara's growth and development rather interesting, and it'd be wise for the next movie to focus on this instead of another hackneyed plot.As a re-introduction to Lara Croft, ""Tomb Raider"" functions well as mindless, Saturday-matinee entertainment. Fans of the genre will be satiated by the action scenes, which are energetic and tactile, not coming across as too CGI-laden. But what ultimately keeps the movie together is Vikander, whose spirit and emotion convince us to buy what the filmmakers are selling. She takes command and we sense she could really take this series beyond where the genre has already explored, which would be fitting, since by the end of this movie, you could say her character is now an ""official"" explorer.*NOTE: The final scene, I feel, is a misstep. Without giving anything away, it takes place at a pawn shop and involves guns. In light of recent tragedies and public outcry regarding the accessibility of firearms, it would be interesting to see, if there ever is a ""Tomb Raider"" sequel, if Lara's character would be just as gung-ho about guns. While I don't encourage any weapons of any kind against people, if Lara must have one, she should stick with her bow and arrow."
"303",3.5,"  A far better Tomb Raider then all the previous sexualized 90s versions."
"304",2.5,"  mostly fun as mindless entertainment. cool adventure feel. also some dumb stuff and things to make fun of. and not very well made overall. lots of shaky-cam, and some mediocre CGI.SPOILERSafter the story was done, they added this ridiculous part to set up a sequel that was really dumb. the step mom was the leader of the organization trying to get the virus??? not only that, but they do the reveal while replaying certain things that were said earlier in the movie, which is pretty normal, but one of the things they repeated was said about 2 minutes earlier, no exaggeration. she told her step mom you can deal with the day to day stuff, and then she realized it as her mom walked away, and it repeated that same line as if we forgot about it"
"305",0.5,"  This movie is so bad and i like most novices, but this. Holy"
"306",4,"  A movie with a certain amount heart, where the audience can empathize with a likable Lara Croft (Vikander). Something the Jolie films failed to allow us to do. Sure you cannot analyze it, (video game Movie), and sure they could have gone further with the jungle (Jane Rambo) sequences and (the Indiana Jones ) Tombs, but it did suceed in becoming what it probably set put for... bring a very good video game movie."
"307",2,"  This movie is a piece of garbage. I was completely unimpressed by the story or lack there of. None of the actors know how to act. It takes about half the movie to even start the story. Half the characters are completely and utterly pointless. There is one scene where the super evil guy shoots someone for just being sick. I presume that this was to show the brutality of the character, but all is it does is make it more ridiculous that he doesn't kill Lu Ren when he tries to kill like all the guards with a shovel. Anyway this movie is terrible. Do not watch it. Spend your two hours that you would be watching this movie, helping the homeless."
"308",4.5,"  i loved this. almost as good as the original, younf laura is dead on"
"309",3.5,"  Sprout is now my least favourite word said in a movie, forced in harder than any of the punches. Fun little action film, Aclicia Vikander is an astounding screen presence and I look forward to seeing more of her."
"310",5,"  I liked Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft. She had more realism than Angelina Jolie. The plot was good, and the character development was good. I think it is a two thumbs up."
"311",5,"  Saw it recently and though it was fantastic. Alicia Vikander was really great and was never very overconfident like Jolie in the PREVIOUS movies. Great story and great action."
"312",4,"  Fun movie - but the whole 'she's normal but gets back up like wolverine' kind if ruins the suspension of disbelief."
"313",5,"  Can¥t wait to stream it ! 5 stars !!!"
"314",4,"  The New Tomb Raider Movie is excellent!Action, Excitement, amazing stunts and true to the game story.What more could you ask for? AlsoAlicia Vikander as Lara Croft is Awesome!"
"315",5,"  Being a Tomb Raider gamer my opinion?????out of 5. A Great Tomb Raider Origins movie. Captures the heart & theme of Tomb Raider. Game play moves, story, exploring, action & puzzles.One critic was scathing saying nothing new and that Alicia Vikander was a stoic & exasperated character. Well my friend Tomb Raider is survival. Maneuvering through varied treacherous terrain, life threatening obstacles and challenges -- no fun time ride.Alicia Vikander gave a GREAT performance. Bringing us deeper into the depths of Tomb Raiding with sweat, dirt, scrapes, bruises & wounds -- with a realistic appropriate stoic, exasperated feel to her character -- surviving.Shall we say ""shaken but not deterred"""
"316",1.5,"  Es como ver una versi√≥n adolescente de ""Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)"". Muy similar en la trama con una hero√≠na que no convence ni a su papa y con un gui√≥n bien bobito con nada nuevo. El poco arte que tiene la salva de ser un fracaso total, es de esas pel√≠culas que es mejor ver con aud√≠fonos y una buena m√∫sica, pues los parlamentos solo empeoran la cosa."
"317",5,"  A melhor adapta√ß√£o de um game que j√° vi. A atua√ß√£o da Alicia Vikander √© maravilhosa, captou completamente a ess√™ncia da Lara Croft"
"318",0.5,"  Honestly Vikander is the only reason this movie gets any stars. The green screen cgi and dialogue were off but she's an extremely talented actress who saved a shred of this movie."
"319",5,"  much better than its being scored as, Much better than the first Tomb Raider. Only thing it was missing was a dance sequence and It Should have been longer but not bad at all"
"320",0.5,"  there is only 1 Lara Croft and she is not here"
"321",4,"  Not sure why this movie isn't getting better ratings. I was going in expecting it to be bad but I thought it was pretty good for a remake. I love Alicia and also I like how it lead up to the Laura Croft we know and left you wanting to see another one. I hope they make the second one I think it would be really good."

"323",2.5,"  Okay action film whose story never catches up with the hype."
"324",2,"  Had a lot of promise, but it ended up being a worse version of ""Raider of the Lost Ark"". The plot tries to do too much; e.g. we are barely introduced to one important character before he get captured and put in a chain gang (and from then on really doesn't affect the story in any meaningful way). The back-to-back ""cliffhanger"" scenes also get tiring; it even seems that Lara's character acknowledges this when she says, ""Really?!"" after one particularly egregious example of having to escape a cliffhanger sequence 3 times in a row. Oh, the film briefly turns into a (completely unnecessary) zombie flick as well."
"325",5,"  Greatly enjoyed.Hollywood has been working for years to try and turn successful video games into successful movies. While they have been met with limited success, these studios have yet to really make a movie that has won over audiences on a broad scale. The most recent effort, Tomb Raider, was not the first great video game movie that so many of us have been waiting for, but it was the closest that we have come so far, and it was clearly a step in the right direction. It certainly qualifies as the best movie based on a game so far. Tomb Raider wasn't perfect, but it was good. That by itself puts the movie above nearly all its competition. There are several things that Tomb Raider did right in making the transition from the video game to the theatrical release. Here are a few of them. If there's one thing that most of the reviews have agreed on, even those that didn't love the film, it's that whatever faults Tomb Raider has, Alicia Vikander is not one of them. The actress puts forth a strong performance as the new Lara Croft and is able to make her a believable action hero while also making her a relatable character."
"326",4.5,"  I WaS SO PLEASANTLY SHOCKED AT HOW AMAZING THIS MOVIE IS. iT WAS CLEAR FROM THE TRAILERS THAT THEY WERE HEADING IN A BETTER DIRECTION FOR THE TOMB RAIDER SERIES THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST WITH NONE OTHER THAN ANGELINA JOLIE. Alicia Vikander TRULY SOARS IN THIS PERFORMANCE AND HAS CREATED A BELIEVABLE, VULNERABLE CHARACTER. THE PLOT IS GOOD, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TOP-NOTCH, THE CINETOGRAPHY AND DIRECTING IS SPOT ON.gO SEE THIS MOVING IN THE BEST THEATER YOU CAN FINE (AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY) AND GRAB THAT POPCORN. IT'S ABOUT TO BE A WILD RIDE!"
"327",2.5,"  Should've cut the first 20 minutes, just start on the boat. Poor story decisions lead to a main protagonist that can't do anything on their own for most of the movie. Iconic moments from the source material are weak and wasted in this adaptation."
"328",5,"  GOOD FUN and much like the originals and also those Harrison Ford movies that Speilberg did. We sat still and enjoyed for r2 hours. Can't wait for the next one.........there will surely be next ones"
"329",4.5,"  Loved it... Went it expecting a turd and was delightfully surprised to see an action packed movie with the oh so lovely Vikander nailing the role! Great nods of the hat to many moments in the game. Go see it for the non stop thrills and I think you'll be happy!!!"
"330",3,"  While it won't push the video game genre to greater heights, Tomb Raider is one of the better movies of the genre and Alicia Vikander makes the role her own."
"331",5,"  Surprisingly decent, especially for a video game movie. Lara set out on her first expedition finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai.The storyline based upon the 2013 reboot of LC, was lauded for revitalizing one of gaming's biggest names and most venerable franchises, and it did it in part by leaning into the narrative side of the medium, with greater depth and characterization for its lead and a clear and compelling story it wanted to tell with her. It surprisingly plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of ""Cliffhanger,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans. Alicia Vikander did a great job here. She's correctly cast as a woman who's literally to-the-manor-born. More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence. Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral performance, letting out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or gets slammed on the ground by a brawny foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace"
"332",2,"  Another victim of the ""Video Game Movie"" curse. I knew this was gonna be a terrible reboot as soon as I saw the trailer but boy, was I in for a treat.First of all, it boggles my mind as onto how this movie got financed with 94 Million Dollars and got handed to people with barely any experience. Thankfully it's flopping at the box office so we won't see a sequel but whoever is using this project as means of money laundering still got their cash back. Tomb Raider made a pathetic 28Mil domestic and a total of 133Mil worldwide as of this moment.Now let's move onto the movie itself. The writers and creators of this project had dozens of ""Tomb Raider"" games to seek inspiration from as well as millions of myths and legends from all around the globe, they picked the weakest concept to be converted into a movie. They chose the 2013 Tomb Raider relaunch of the game series, which focuses on a young Lara Croft going out into the world for the first time and becoming the legend that she is. NOBODY want's to see this as a movie, (I'm assuming) most of us who saw the movie are familiar with the game lore to at least a minimal extent. The developers of the game had to start fresh and make a new Lara without outrage, this movie didn't have to worry about that. Audiences wanted two hours of an epic action-adventure set in exotic locales, following the story of the most badass female hero in the world. Instead, we got to sit through an excruciating and cringy two-hour drama about a whiny, entitled, dumb ""teenager"" who is repeatedly humiliated at every single task that she attempts on her quest to find and save her daddy. It's not ""relatable"", it's just bad and sad. Personally, the casting of Alicia Vikander was the first disappointment while the movie was still in production. Why not use Camilla Luddington who the new Lara Croft is based on, played by and voiced by? Why go for a C-List actress in hopes of a higher box-office? Those choices are beyond me. Alicia's Lara reminds me of Kristen Stewart's performance of Bella in the ""Twilight"" series - lifeless, bland and annoying. Perhaps, it's just the horrendous writing and she's a good actress, I honestly can't tell, however I know for a fact there is lots of wasted potential in this movie. Take Walton Goggins for example, fantastic performance in The Hateful Eight, sub-par performance in Tomb Raider, however, I don't think the script gave the actors much to work with, no room to act or express themselves/their characters in this adaptation.Literally, everything about the writing in this movie is depressingly bad, characters often speak their motivations, emotions and plot exposition through the blandest, most boring, unnatural dialogue you can possibly imagine. This movie feels like it was written by somebody who's never written a movie before. Oh wait, Geneva Robertson-Dworet who wrote this movie has never worked on a single other movie before. Shocking, I know! You know what's more shocking? She's set to write Marvel's first female-led superhero film ""Captain Marvel"", as well as ""Sherlock Holmes 3"" and the upcoming live-action adaptation of ""Dungeons & Dragons"". I pray to the studio executives and the ""big mouse"" that they take those movies away from her because they will be a train-wreck otherwise. The other contributing writer of this movie, Alastair Siddons is almost equally inexperienced with 1 movie behind their belt (which sits at a 27% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes).If you've ever though some movie checks off every single cliche and trope of its genre, whatever movie you have in mind has a new competitor. Tomb Raider is one of the most painfully predictable movies to a point of hilarity. Literally, I was laughing my entire way through this film because it follows it's own formula beat by beat leaving nothing behind. I would honestly say it's as bad but also equally entertaining as ""Suicide Squad"". To be fair, I would assume that most average moviegoers who are programmed to enjoy their mindless entertainment made by a formula won't even notice anything off and shrug it off as a ""decent"" movie. However, if you have any amount self-respect and prior knowledge of films, I think it's safe to say this will be a great new addition to your ""so bad it's good"" collection of movies.Moving on from that, the action is honestly as boring and predictable as the writing, with some of the best scenes being lifted directly, frame-by-frame from the 2013 video-game. The fighting choreography is equally ""meh"". The cinematography is also not this movies strong suit, nor are the special effects or acting or production design or anything really. In fact, the movie consists of maybe about 15 minutes of tomb raiding, meaning if you cut this movie down by about an hour and a half, it would make a perfect short film. Also, most importantly, even though nobody wants to see an origin story, that being the crucial part of this movie and it's plot, I'm afraid to say it fails on that promise and there is absolutely no character development at all. Maybe with the exception of cheesy lines such as ""You messed with the wrong Croft"" and ""I guess I'm not that kind of Croft"" and Croft this and Croft that and ""I'll take two guns please"". Get it? It's a reference for nerds like you! This movie beats it's gaming audience in the head with pointless Easter eggs and makes sure to point them out and scream about it as if we're all dumb babies.My conclusion is that even ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was significantly better and had its moments unlike the 2018 adaptation of ""Tomb Raider"". So, if you like learning from ""bad Hollywood"" or just want to have mindless fun or maybe need to fall asleep on a flight, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise, be it the games or the movie franchise starring Angelina Jolie, you'll be severely disappointed. If you're a fan of the action-adventure genre and want a thrilling escape from reality, desperately trying to scratch that itch, wanting to feel the way you did when you watched movies like ""Indiana Jones"", ""The Mummy"" (original trilogy), ""National Treasure"" or even ""Sahara"" then once again, prepare for disappointment."
"333",4,"  Tomb Raider was pretty good. Alicia Vikander is awesome. She does a great job playing a younger more innocent version. Then at the end she becomes the Angelina Jolie version.. She was great in Ex Machina too. What an actress."
"334",3.5,"  Just saw it and it's not bad at all. It's an action film so don't expect too much character development. If you want that then go an watch an oscar bait film. This movie serves it's purpose of being two hours of good fun to just sit back, eat ypur popcorn, drink your soft drink and chill without having to over think anything. It's one of the better video game adaptions so don't worry about what these critics say and watch it for yourself."
"335",0.5,"  Boring and dumb. Papa Croft is supposed to be a brilliant researcher yet he doesn't know what genocide means. Seriously who writes this stuff?"
"336",4,"  Great movie, nice character building. Great visuals and good directing."
"337",3,"  For an adventure movie, it is above average. For a video game movie, it is the greatest ever made. I had a good time with this movie. It also gives me hope for future video game adaptations."
"338",3.5,"  Call me crazy but I actually really enjoyed this movie. No doubt, there were some parts of the dialogue that I found lacking but that blame falls on the script righter, not the actors. I also felt like Daniel Wu's character was really under used. However, the places where the movie did excel where with the action scenes. Even to a mundane bike chase scene was portrayed as an exciting action sequence. The sound producers also did an excellent job illustrating the spooky atmosphere of the Tomb of Himiko, with a horror moviesque jump scares. Overall, I think this movie does a good job adapting the 2013 video game. Unlike many other critics, I like the more serious attitude that this movie and the newer games take on Lara Croft's character. But it appears that many horny men can't find interest in a movie with a female lead unless she is overly sexualized and makes jokes."
"339",5,"  I have been a huge Tomb Raider fan since I was very young. I remember my dad buying the games for me and taking me to see the movies with Angelina Jolie as Lara. I loved those movies, and thought they could never be top them. This movie is a great representation of the new Tomb Raider games. I think the moive was entertaining to watch but this might be just because I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan. But the movie was beautiful and I felt that the acting was on par with great actors such as Alicia Vikander playing as Lara Croft. I will admit there are flaws in the movie, some of which that will need to be improve if there is to be a sequel but overall I was impressed with what they did with this movie adaptation of my beloved favorite video game."
"340",2,"  Entertaining in parts, but this script needed a lot of work. The story makes no sense at all. I can suspend belief, but don't spend so much time on exposition when what you are saying makes no sense. Only surprises are when something that would make sense doesn't happen."
"341",5,"  As a major fan of the games since the first game, i was very worried I would hate this film, but I really enjoyed it. I think they did an excellent job with the pacing of this film. The story to action ratio is very reminiscent of a lot of the games in the franchise. The character doesn't feel quite like the Lara Croft we were expecting to see, but that's because she isn't... Yet. This story aims to show how an ambitious, grounded, and adventurous girl becomes the badass, skilled, and experienced Tomb Raider we know and love. Optimistic for the next film."
"342",5,"  As a love time fan of the video game and of Alicia Vikander I have to say this film is amazing! It captures the true essence of the game and it's characters. While I would have liked more to see Lara battle with the main antagonist that doesn't hurt the film. The acting was spot on especially between Lara and her father. Great Tomb Raider moments and Alicia Vikander is a solid Lara Croft! I hope this movie gets a sequel. Not perfect but definitely a solid film and worth the watch."
"343",4,"  Just finished watching this last night with my student apartment neighbour... and my 2nd time at IMAX!! For a videogame movie that wasn't deep but mediocre story-wise, the Tomb Raider Movie was the most fun I've had... & I've even find my new bae-loved Lara Croft!"
"344",4.5,"  It's no surprise that this movie shines in the action department, but I was pleased to see that there were likable characters attached with just enough interaction and development to ground the whole movie. I enjoy Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, as she's a very good representation of the original VG character - Alicia Vikander very much embodies the new Lara that was rebooted by Crystal Dynamics is the 2013 game.Overall this focuses more on becoming the Tomb Raider, coming to terms with her family's power, her place in it, and finding her own agency- all of which will help to add to Lara's depth if the franchise continues."
"345",3.5,"  I just saw this movie today and it was great. But the reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it seemed like a rip off of Indiana Jones and Rouge One A Star Wars Story"
"346",4,"  I enjoyed this movie from the beginning to end. Based on the Survivor series, this movie had some pretty brutal moments, and a okay story. Alicia Vikander did a great job playing Lara Croft, but the main villain Mathias Vogel felt like any other cookie-cutter villain. I did enjoy this movie, but it could've been better."
"347",1.5,"  It's not awful, its just not that interesting. Its generic. Safe. The movie takes both story lines from the two new games and fuck them both up.."
"348",4,"  Alicia is awesome!!!better story line with Angie Tomb Raider series for me.now im expecting this gonna extend to trilogy."
"349",4,"  a bit predictable, but a very good watch, as a fan of the games, i felt it portrayed it well, better than the old ones."
"350",4,"  Five foot five, she's jacked, I am in.The scene where she manages to climb the dude's rack and get a chokehold on him is priceless. One suggestion. Laura needs a new bow and arrow set. The pull on her bow is so weak the arrows it shoots would probably just bounce off somebody's forehead.More please."
"351",4.5,"  I really enjoyed this film. I've played the most recent video games and it did have a similar feel to it. Of course the games are better, but it was still nice to watch. Alicia Vikander Really made it. What an amazing actress!"
"352",2,"  The movie is not bringing anything new, the story we saw 100 of times in other movies and it is all cliche at this pointWe didnt get the feeling of Lara Croft that excel in physical but felt more it was luck she survived this situation I wasnt able to feel the characters outside of Daniel Wu eveyone acting was mediocre at mostThe shots of movies werent that great starting with the first scene and the fight scene where the director used every single shot he got from all angles, not just it hurt my eyes jumping between all these cuts but it didnt look good at all, im sad that directors are still using this technique to force the audience to feel the actionI didnt get my self to finish the movie and I left the moment she found her father, i was like im done bad scenes, bad shots and bad storyI will give 1 star because I realy like Daniel Wu doing a drunk man scene, that was a great performance"
"353",4.5,"  A fantastic performance from Vikander and a great depiction of the modern game and the genre in general. Hopefully more to come. Although the plot could have been less predictable. Loved it."
"354",5,"  I love the game and love this movie"
"355",4,"  A ridiculous movie, but one that fits incredibly well into the universe of Tomb Raider. It keeps very well with the tone of the games while making a story that works well for the big screen."
"356",4.5,"  Solid action movie and Alicia Vikkander is a delight as Lara Croft. A pretty faithful film adaption of the 2013 game with enough that's different to not make it a copy and paste job."
"357",3,"  If you leave your expectations at the door, 'Tomb Raider' w/ Alicia Vikander is a decent movie. If you're expecting Oscar worthy performances or award winning dialog, shame on you. Tomb Raider is about action-adventure and nothing else. There are no super-human powers. No alien space tech from across the universe. No inter-galactic world crushing bad guy. What you do get is Lara Croft chasing her father's ghost half way around the world to a remote island in an attempt to stop people from unearthing the goddess of death. Yes, this movie is flawed but there is enough action to hold your attention for two hours. If you're good with that, great, just remember to leave your expectations at the door. It may not be worth full price, but it is worth your time."
"358",3.5,"  A movie made for the videogames fans. It's not quite great, with many clichÈs and obvious lines. But, as someone who has played both new games, I must say that the effort mixing elements from two different stories are great. It is worthy somehow."
"359",3.5,"  My expectations were moderate here so i was surprised a bit. Better than i thought. Straightforward, Indiana Jones type story. She is not as right for the part as Anjelina was but she did a solid job. There is a sequel coming too."
"360",3.5,"  Its well crafted story and i love the villain..."
"361",4.5,"  It was better than i thought, I enjoyed it more the second time."
"362",5,"  This Tomb Raider is like a perfect mix of Indiana Jones and the Mummy. Even though it was long, I didn't feel bored or like it was dragging- the time went by quickly, and I wish there were more Alicia Vikander Tomb Raider movies to watch. It was a perfect mix of action, emotion, and Alicia Vikander was the perfect Lara Croft. I also loved Daniel Wu's character. Overall, I thought it was the perfect movie to escape for a little while, and I hope they make more!"
"363",4,"  Very much a new Indiana Jones and, in that genre, perfectly watchable. All the usual tomb traps and lots of impossible leaping about, but not too much motion blur and pointless violence that mars so many other films. I enjoyed it for what it was and would watch it again at Christmas if it came on the telly."
"364",4,"  I enjoyed this film, and I hope they make more in this series."
"365",1,"  The film was dreadful. Too much cheesiness. Bad acting and unrealistic."
"366",3.5,"  This version was better than the original. the Story was engaging and very entertaining."
"367",1,"  Wow was this bad--- very poor predictable script, Vikander is wooden, her character is weak and not very bright. Insult to the franchise."
"368",5,"  Al√≠cia is astonishing! Lot of action, great adventure, better origin for a successful franchise."
"369",3.5,"  It's a very entertaining film based on the tomb raider reboot game. Although it's not perfect it does lay a strong foundation for future movies."
"370",5,"  I actually really enjoyed this movie. I like this new take (follows the rebooted video game). For a movie based on a video game this is Excellent. My wife really liked the movie as well"
"371",4,"  Funny, action-packed, interesting and a good pop-corn-movie!"
"372",4,"  I really enjoyed this as a Tomb Raider fan."
"373",0.5,"  Absolute garbage, I am a huge fan of the tomb raider series, but this lara croft was portrayed as a complete fool. alicia vikander should have made an excellent tomb raider however was let down by the script writers and production"
"374",3,"  Slow at the start resulting in a rushed finish of the main story.. I like the seeds they left for a sequel and would definitely see it if its made"
"375",4,"  8/10 h istoria adikei tin oreksi tou skinotheti kai twn ithopoiwn..."
"376",3.5,"  Tomb Raider has a plot you have seen a million times before, it has good acting with a mediocre script and passable special effects. But, the action scenes are intense and the tomb that needs raiding has an interesting history that nearly reaches Indiana Jones levels of lore. The perfect popcorn movie."
"377",4.5,"  This movie was perfect for what I was looking for. An exciting and fun adventure. However, it's not too campy or silly, with the exception of her getting over her wounds quickly, but she has to do something around the middle of the film that causes her to react realistically and I thought it was an excellent touch. Just many small things make this the best action movie I've seen so far this year."
"378",3,"  3/5. Tomb Raider is a good video game adaptation, but just an ok movie. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect and doesn't do anything super interesting."
"379",3.5,"  I had fun, good experience to check out at least once. Mundane story, with solid action and performances. I'll give props to Vikander."
"380",3,"  decent adaption of the 2013 game"
"381",2.5,"  Alicia didn't make the sell as hardcore adventurer out to solve the mystery of her father's disappearance. She wasn't convincing as the heroine. ...2nd installment will be much better!"
"382",0.5,"  Horrible, bad acting, bad directing and many open plot holes."
"383",3.5,"  Not perfect, but it was entertaining for the most part. Alicia Vikander does a great job with the role of Lara Croft. My biggest issue was things happened way to conveniently and it kind of took me out of the movie and could no longer suspend disbelief. With that said, I would still watch a sequel."
"384",1.5,"  F-Ugly! In a word!Seriously, can Hollywood PLEASE stop casting kids as action movie stars?? Or put them in any leading role that requires maturity, personality, or respect. All they think about today is, what looks good on a poster and in a trailer; not what will keep them coming back for more. This movie had nothing to root for, all relationships they wanted you to feel for - was just that! They WANTED you to, because they did not earn your sentiment at all. I actually wanted the movie to end, and that ain't good!"
"385",2.5,"  A pretty disappointing movie. Nothing really terrible but nothing really cool either."
"386",0.5,"  ""Let's cast a boy to play Lara Croft"""
"387",4,"  As a fan of the game franchise and being disappointed by every single game to movie adaptation, I have lowered my expectations for this. Turns out I really liked it. I only have 2 complaints: There are a lot of lines that are too predictable. And I understand they wanted to make it more real than fantastical but I really preferred Himiko's story and role in the game."
"388",3,"  Not bad, I can understand why green Lara would fail at almost everything, lacking the experience and skill of older Lara portrayed by Jolie but that doesn't explain why she keeps running away and hiding. This Lara is more cowardly. Jolie's Tomb Raider movies are slightly more enjoyable."
"389",3.5,"  A Solid Entertaining Ride. I would say this is the best Video Game Film Adaptation to Date. Vikander plays a lovely Lara Croft. I hope we see a sequel for this."
"390",2,"  Quick review of Tomb Raider: A mishmash of action cliches and cheap jump scares that do not do the franchise any justice. Try to remember the cliches found in 2012 (2009 with John Cusack) where the protagonist was on the verge of collapse, only to be saved by deus ex machina. Have that image in your mind? Now rinse and repeat for virtually every action sequence in the 2 hour time span and you've summarized the ""action"" portion of this film. Alicia Vikander was wonderful in Deus Ex Machina (2015) and entertaining in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015); however, her role fell short here. I felt that the role of Lara Croft will be attempted by many female actresses and much like the role of James Bond, each individual should add a unique twist on that role - a signature, if you will. Such a signature would separate that actor's contributions from past iterations. Unfortunately, Vikander added little to separate her from Angelina Jolie's sultry and seductive take on a then-sexualized role. Granted, it could be argued that the role wasn't designed for a lot of emotional development, but Jolie still brought a sense of emotional attachment to her father in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). This degree of depth and even the dilemma, upon further reflection, was copied in all-to-similar fashion in this rendition. Dominic West performed well and it is a shame his personal demons were not given more screen time. This leaves us with a conclusion: this movie, as a reboot, works as a copy to the original. If you want a more humanized Lara Croft in a predictable screenplay, this may work for you. If you are looking for something new, look else. 2 Jumping Mummies out of 5."
"391",4,"  i enjoyed the character building aspect. then the 2nd and 3d act were filled with great action. The movie provided some heartfelt moments and some well placed levity. Finally, the musical score was amazing. Junkie XL really killed it."
"392",5,"  A really good movie with a Really good plot twist"
"393",4,"  Really was better than I anticipated, which surprised me as a long time fan of the TR franchise. The acting on Vikanders part was impressive.... they did take some liberties with the story line in the movie vs the video game it was based on. My significant other enjoyed the movie and has no particular interest in the games. Id give it two thumbs up."
"394",0.5,"  We left 1 hour into the movie. This wil be on the all time worst five list, forever. The script is poorly written. The lead is too young and too simple a character. A spoiled tempermental brat, that doesn't have enough intelligence to to be a heroin or to even travel alone to a remote area of the world. The long, drawn out drama scenes make up 85 percent of the movie. I will stay clear of this director and actress in the future. The dentist would have been more enjoyable. AVOID going seeing this!"
"395",5,"  Amazing movie. Thoroughly enjoyed.Can't wait for a second one."
"396",3,"  a great story, Alicia Vikander is a wonderful Lara Croft"
"397",3.5,"  Though flawed in pacing and character development, the movie still manages to stand out among other video-game adapted movies because of the action and performance from the main protagonist and might be the best live-action movie in this genre."
"398",4.5,"  Probably the best video game adaption we'll get in a while featuring a great lead character and a fun adventure. B+"
"399",5,"  Loved Alicia in this but agree story line lacked something. Still a very enjoyable film. Looking forward to part 2."
"400",5,"  Come on negative nancy's out there! This was a great movie; just what you want to do at movies--escape from reality! It was fun, adventurous. Tough girl we wished we were and hope our daughters get some inspiration. Geesh. I could care less what the director was thinking. I think he did just fine."
"401",5,"  Alicia Vikander captures a stunning performance as Lara Croft, while also bringing the lovable and enjoyable moments we experienced within the game. allowing us to also love this exceptional Video Game Adaption."
"402",2,"  Another great opportunity to make a good movie, down the toilet..."
"403",5,"  it's a brilliant movie. As long as you see it as a background movie."
"404",3.5,"  Considering this is based on the video game, it really wasn't too bad! Actually, it was pretty good up until the climax and ending. Not a fan of Lara losing her archaeological background in this version, but I get why they changed things a bit for the younger generations.I admired how they handled the original game's fantastical elements, and both Alicia Vikander and Daniel Wu gave solid performances. All in all, this was fun movie to watch! I'd totally watch another Tomb Raider flick with these characters. :D"
"405",5,"  Wonderfull film, Amazing action sequences, Well ddirected."
"406",5,"  My favorite movie EVER <3"
"407",3.5,"  Lara Croft was best known for her exaggerated physical assets (rendered as Madonna-worthy pointed polygons) and short shorts than as any sort of character. She was realized on the big screen in 2001's Tomb Raider as an elite physical specimen portrayed by Angelina Jolie, where the filmmakers went the added step of padding Jolie's bosom to better reflect the source material's image. The filmmakers literally thought this aspect would be make-or-break with fans, as if Jolie herself was not naturally vivacious enough. As you can imagine, Lara Croft was primarily seen as a sexy avatar, whether on the small screen or the big screen. This new Tomb Raider aims to better ground its story, tone, and central heroine, and it mostly succeeds. This is a solid, pleasantly enjoyable mid-tier action movie that might also qualify as the best video-game-to-film adaptation so far (sorry Uwe Boll).Lara (Alicia Vikander) is struggling in the wake of her father's (Dominic West) disappearance. It's been years but she holds onto hope that dear old dad is still out there. One day, she discovers her father's secret study and a video message he recorded confessing why he left. He's seeking a fabled tomb on a hidden island off the coast of Japan, a tomb devoted to a powerful goddess of myth who sacrificed her admirers. Also looking for the tomb is Vogel (Walton Goggins) and a team of armed mercenaries. Lara must stay ahead of the mercenaries, find her father and the long-lost hidden tomb.This is a Lara Croft stripped down and absent the male gaze, which has defined her travails just as much as the treasure hunting adventures. There's not a single shot in the movie that seeks to ogle Vikander's lean body. Even her outfit, as mentioned a staple of Croft's early appeal, is a modest take top and khakis. The emphasis this time is on what she endures and overcomes rather than the curvature of her body. This is an attempt at an origin tale, rebooting Lara for a new generation of fans. She's less the cool buxom sexpot with the twin pistols than a struggling young woman facing her fears. This is the first time Lara Croft has been envisioned as a character. There's a level of broader realism that the movie holds onto, positioning this Croft as less the gun blazing super cool badass and more as a stealthy, plucky, and scrappy figure of moderate action. There are moments where she hides and moments where she runs, as they are the best recourse. She's not imposing in her build and poise like a Gina Carano (Haywire) but Vikander's got some serious moves. With all that in mind, let's not get too carried away here. Lara Croft may have some extra dimensions but she's not exactly a fully formed, three-dimensional character or boasting the kind of magnetic personality that drew us to Indiana Jones or even a Nathan Drake. She's capable but also limited in interest and charisma.The action is invigorating enough and given a clear scope of play. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug (The Wave) orchestrates the action in clean long shots and precise edits, allowing the audience a clear sense of what is happening. A frantic bicycle chase and foot chase in the first act are given extra vitality by a roaming camera that takes in the full view. There's enough variety in the action and natural consequences to keep things interesting. This is a movie that doesn't feel overpowered with CGI, even though I know it's present. Uthaug makes a point of emphasizing practical effects and sets, which adds a further level of realism to the excitement. I'd call it a more pared down, realistic version of an action adventure but it still has outlandish set pieces like Lara finding refuge atop a crumbling WWII era bomber that just so happens to be wedged atop a rock face overlooking a steep waterfall. Even during these moments, and the last act takes place almost entirely within the ancient tomb and its traps, the movie keeps things relatively credible. It's fun without being too flippant and serious enough without losing its sense of amusement. Tomb Raider reminded me a lot of a big-screen version of an Uncharted game, a rollicking adventure that also feels rooted in our own world, but with a hint of the supernatural creeping along the edges. The conclusion has a few nice surprises following this pattern even with the possibility of actual zombies emerging.Vianker (The Danish Girl) acquits herself nicely in the realm of action-adventure. She gained twelve pounds of muscle and has a pretty impressive six-pack. Vikander is a smaller actress by nature but the filmmakers do a fine job of placing her in believable action scenarios that rely upon her athleticism. Her Lara is a stubbornly independent protagonist who refuses to give up, which makes her a winning force even when her personality fails to sufficiently light up the screen. Vikander hurls herself into the role, performing an impressive array of stunts, and yelping along to the genre demands.There are some plot holes that are hard to ignore, mostly pertaining to motivations. In the first act, we learn tat Lara is heir to a vast fortune of money and a big company that owns many other subsidiaries. However, she refuses to essentially inherit the company because it means having to sign papers declaring her missing father as deceased. I understand the character's rejection of wanting to accept her father's death, but when taken to this extent it becomes almost comical. Lara is seen scraping by for enough money to survive on her own. She's forced to pawn her heirlooms and work as a bicycle messenger. She's struggling to get by and yet her pride is standing between her and a massive fortune. This is just stupid. What's to stop Lara from signing the paperwork, inheriting the fortune, and using said fortune to continue the search for her father? There's also the motivation of her absentee father, who left to thwart the bad guys from finding the special tomb. However, he inadvertently leads them there because he was tracked. Had he not even left, the bad guys would not have found the island's location and he could have been in Lara's life. This is transparent potting to simply move the pieces across a board. Another example is Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) a ship captain ally she picks up that serves no real purpose other than ferrying her to the island. One character that benefits from motivation is the villain, Vogel. He's not some mustache-twirling rogue but rather a guy hired for a job that wants to go home and see his kids again. It's a nice, empathetic touch that makes Vogel grounded and a better fit.Tomb Raider is a smaller, leaner, and enjoyable little action movie of modest ambitions. That sounds very conditional, I'll admit, but it's a scaled-down version of an exaggerated character doing splashy, sexy, exaggerated action heroics. It's a stripped down reboot that grounds the action while still finding enough ways to have fun. It does get a little caught up in the edicts of an origin tale, overpowering moments with ""First"" significance (First Adventure, First Kill, First Fight, etc.). There are also some head-scratching plot holes that get glossed over to keep things moving along. Vikander is one tough cookie, and the film celebrates her brains as well as her brawn and absent any ogling camerawork. Tomb Raider is a suitably exciting action film that gives some hope for future Croft adventures.Nate's Grade: B"
"408",1,"  Alicia Vikander tries to replicate Angelina Jolie's failure of a performance in this failed blockbuster hit. As this unfortunately is the best video-game movie of all time, it is a failed attempt of such a great game released in 2016."
"409",1.5,"  I enjoyed the actors but the story line sucked"
"410",4,"  After seeing this movie with a long anticipated wait, I was rather happy money was spent to see on the big screen. There was quite a bit of a different take on this movies story line especially when it came to Lara's father. The puzzles could have been a more tricky and more interesting to see being solved. There were a few major scenes taken from the newer 2013-15 games that were incorporated into the movie which made me very happy. The actress was an amazing take on a modern Lara Croft ( in her younger days when she first started out raiding tombs... or fighting mercenaries at best). I feel like there could have been more squeezed into the movie that would have made t better. The adventure Lara went on as well as running into Mathias and his gang, could have had more. Also, what Lara does with her iconic necklace really bothered me even the at the end,"
"411",5,"  This is by far the best video game movie ever made!When I first saw the trailers for the movie I was skeptic that the movie would do well. My initial reactions were: (1) the lead actress did not resemble Lara Croft, and (2) the most recent video game movies (Warcraft and Assassins Creed) both did horribly.Boy was I wrong and happy to be so. The cast of the movie was believable, charismatic, and genuinely brought their characters to life. The story was tight with a great balance of action, humor, and emotion. I especially love that the film did not try to incorporate any cliches.In my opinion, if this movie is an example of what video game movies can become then we gamers are in for some good times. Here's me hoping that this film gets a sequel."
"412",3,"  Was a decent watch though it started off real slow and doesn't finish in a satisfactory manner. Premise was silly as well in both the concept and the execution as well. Still Alicia Vikander played her role fantastically and felt more of a human character than movies of this time usually give us. Clearly set up for a franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing another one, hopefully a sequel can improve on this foundation."
"413",3,"  The movie was almost a shot by shot of the video game which I didn't mind. The actress was great but still not lara croft enough."
"414",4,"  Simply the best entry int the series. Vikander is really good as Lara, and the character is very well drawn. The action and humor are very good ,and good, respectively."
"415",2,"  Stupid Girl who would not listen to her Father."
"416",3.5,"  I found the movie a good adaptation to the character and the games.Alicia Vikander is great, and I also liked Daniel Wu's performance.""Tomb Raider (2018)"" Its nothing new, but its entertaining and does the character of Lara Croft justice, unlike the Angelina Jolie's portrayal...I'll be waiting for the sequel, and hopefully it improves on the already established character, and takes Lara to some bigger better tombs."
"417",3.5,"  I liked Alicia as Lara Croft. The writing in the movie was also crisper than most action adventure movies. The pace was fun and fast as expected. It would be a killer video game, this movie (I'm sure it was thought of the other way around!). Watch this in big screen if you can."
"418",3.5,"  Average movie. But Alicia Vikander saved it for me personally, she performed perfectly."
"419",4,"  much better than jolie's version... the motion n gesture of vikander very identical to lara croft in the video game..."
"420",2,"  I had high hopes that this reboot might have found their way through the video game to movie trap but that was wishful thinking. For a film that obviously had a good budget, the directing and story-line choices were abysmal at times. Worse though was the completely misguided casting of Lara Croft. Not once did I connect with Alicia Vikander which is too bad because she normally is a likable actor. It was an uninspiring performance of a character who is supposed to be extremely charismatic and a modern day Indiana Jones. Note to filmmakers, don't assume your audience are idiots."
"421",3.5,"  As A Fan Of The Original Games And A Lover Of The Recent Ones, I Found Tomb Raider A Nice, Fast-Paced And Thrilling Adventure.It Doesn't Transcend It's Genre, It Isn't A Masterpiece.Some Of It's Problems Include A Lazy & Messy Script And Weak Character Development Dispite The Main Character. Walton Goggins Was A Fine Villain, A Bit Cliche At Times.But, Alicia Vikander Is The Perfect Lara Croft. She Is Fantastic As This Character , And She Was The Best Thing For Me In This Movie.This Movie Also Is Heavy-Based On The 2013 Game , Which Was Nice To See So Many References, So Many Moments That Really Felt Nostallgic.Again, Tomb Raider Is An Acceptable Action/Adventure Movie. It doesn't transcend Really Anything And I Hope It Gets A Sequel, With Vikander, But With Better Writing I Think Roar Uthaug Did A Decent Job Too, Because The Action Sequences Are Well Made And Really GrittyAgain, It's a Fine, Fun, Pop-corn action movie starring Lara Croft Kicking Some A##"
"422",0.5,"  Can't believe it,, Terrible, never release another Tomb Raider movie again."
"423",2,"  Aside from one semi-inventive set piece, Tomb Raider is a generic action film that is as easily watchable as it is forgettable. Vikander tries hard, but she doesn't have the screen magnetism to play such a beloved character. Everything else is underwhelming: the booby traps, the score, the VFX, the directing, the pacing... there's nothing special about this reboot. This saga should have stayed buried with Himiko."
"424",3,"  A much better film than the version of Angelina Jolie. Alicia did a good job as Lara Croft and the movie at least goes a bit beyond a mere video game adaptation when trying to create a new mythology for the character with motivations, a more solid past and an opening for new movies in the future. Good fun with some wonderfully absurd scenes."
"425",4.5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an excellent origin story. A little slow in the middle but definitely felt like they took the game from the small screen to the big screen. Can't wait for the sequel."
"426",3.5,"  You won't leave this movie feeling like you haven't enjoyed yourself, but you equally won't leave itching for more."
"427",2,"  The earlier films weren't great but they were a guilty pleasure... the key word being 'pleasure' as they were a lot of fun.The new reboot was, for me, devoid of any fun and actually felt a bit dour."
"428",5,"  I don't understand all the hate this movie is getting, I loved it!"
"429",5,"  Loved this movie. Alicia is fantastic. Don't need a bunch of flowery commentary by unqualified critics to ruin an action packed, great first start to the new franchise. And if you haven't seen it, oh yes, it's set up for a follow on!"
"430",4.5,"  I loved the new Tomb Raider movie. It's really fun and a thrill to experience. Vikander brought a lot of depth and emotion to a character that's been very goofy in the past. Not anymore. The new Lara is a survivor, full of heart and very brave. Loved all of it."
"431",4.5,"  My daughter and I went and saw this movie Monday night. we thought it had good action and we loved Alicia as lara croft."
"432",3,"  I liked it. took it for what it is. a movie. Kept hoping Angelina took her girls to go see it. Alicia did a great job. Girl power!"
"433",4,"  this movie was a really good movie"
"434",4,"  I enjoyed this film. It a fun by the numbers adventure film. no not listen to the critics, the audience score is much closer to the mark."
"435",5,"  One of the films that I expected and exceeded my expectations, a film so good from the beginning to the end. With incredible action scenes and details based on the video game so well echos that surprised me a lot. Alicia Vikander is the most perfect Lara Croft, she was born to play that character, I connect a lot with her, she is beautiful, Daniel Wu and Walton Goggins excellent, I really liked her performances. The special effects, the fight scenes, the landscapes and the soundtrack were incredible. Personally, it is the best movie based on video games, the fans are going to leave the cinema with a huge smile because this movie did not disappoint."
"436",0.5,"  HATE THIS PILE OF DOG dookie"
"437",3,"  Cool stunts and some nice twists make for an enjoyable time!!! Nice diversion on a rainy winter day."
"438",3.5,"  i liked this more grittier version of Lara Croft better than Angelina. This is very close to the newer two games and was fun to watch. The scenery is beautiful as is Alicia. the cave could have used some more lighting but over all, I would recomment you go see this on the big screen."
"439",2,"  Saw this in an advanced screening. Overall it's a mediocre action movie that doesn't bring anything special to the table. Would recommend for watching on a long flight."
"440",3,"  Tomb Raider is now the third feature film adaptation of Square Enix's game series, this time around Lara Croft is portrayed by Alicia Vikander no longer Angelina Jolie of the original first two films.Lara Croft is the heir to the Croft family her father has been missing for quite sometime and she's very independent, she doesn't feel the need to take any of this money; but once she uncovers some truths about her father and a possible location where he may have gone missing, she sets out on her very first adventure to find him.This film is very much based on the 2013 reboot game and it follows it very closely, many visual elements from that game carry over to this film including tiptoeing across a plane that's stuck in a waterfall or tiptoeing across a tree that's fallen over a cliff, surviving a lot of falls even certain wounds that she gets are straight out of the game.When she comes face to face with danger and a life-threatening situation in which she has to make a terrible choice, it plays out similar to the game and in that way, this is one of the most visually faithful video game adaptations ever made.This film was directed by Roar Uthaug and with him he's brought a good sense of momentum, he understands the important stepping stones that have to be present to setup Lara Croft as the Tomb Raider we know her to be and all the things that have to happen for that development to make sense. Her first Adventure, her first kill, her first wound she has to dress all of these are setup fairly well and that's my biggest takeaway as a positive from this movie is the character of Lara Croft has never been portrayed in a film more realistically and better.Alicia Vikander is really good in this movie, she honours this character so well and whether or not fans end up liking this movie or not I think the majority will walk away happy with the portrayal of Croft on the big screen.As someone who is a fan of the games, who has played most of them, I was overall happy with this adaptation, it has a few issues storytelling wise and in the first acts pacing, but I think Tomb Raider fans will mostly be happy, it's not great film by any means it has a lot of silly elements and for the most part it's just a fun action thriller."
"441",2,"  Vikander is entirely misplaced in this generic clapboard house of a script, delivering hackneyed lines of dialogue to drive home predictable emotions and an equally predictable storyline riddled with plot holes. This is no fun to watch."
"442",5,"  its a good movie that you need to go see"
"443",3,"  Watched it a second time, and enjoyed it more. The sound throughout the film is well crafted. From the soundtrack that revs up your emotions at the suspense or the sounds within the film the characters hear and that are heightened so the audience is cued into what is important. The archery she did as a kid was a cleverly placed flashback since she used it and it is a motif of the whole film. She could have so easily killed the bad guys by pushing them into the many chasms. Plot line was well organized. Humorous throughout. I definitely want to box. and do a bike fox hunt. Incredulous that she escaped death by rocks at the end, but whatever. There will undoubtably be a second movie."
"444",4,"  This movie is certainly a step up from other video game movies, A+ for Alicia Vikander and the fathers casting ????????????????????"
"445",0.5,"  This is an origin movie between the Assassins and the Abstergo Templars. And the Assasin's name is Bruce Wayne.SPOILERS:I didn't want to write ""SPOILERS""... since the movie already ruined it for you at the beginning by mentioning the existence of Himiko and Yamatai island anyway...But...Faithfully? Really? After they change the motive of Himiko from a villain with a desire to be reborn to a savior to keep deadly virus out? The huge take of the game was on supernatural phenomenon of how Himiko can control weather, summon mythical creatures or transfer souls ceremonially. Yet, instead, the director came up with what he thinks that make sense to him and invent a disease for the sake of the potential of making it into a bioweapon - just to introduce Trinity ( for sequel purposes ). The whole supernatural thing were being mentioned all movie long yet completely ignored at the end of the movie. This movie is a disaster - I am indignant that such a good origin story of Lara Croft wasted on the needs of being logical. Lara ending up fighting against trinity is analogues to Ezios against Abstergo. In fact, this would make a great AC Origins movie. Oh yea, btw, Lara is rich because of her dad's inheritance (thus the Bruce Wayne part).Speaking of being logical, the decision made by Clara wasn't so sense-making: in the scene in which Lara tried to stop the Trinity guy from escaping with the Virus, while the villain was on the step ladder that connects the cliffs, Lara chose to jump along onto the ladder rather than to remove the ladder so then the dude would just fall into the abyss (chasm of souls). One might argue that she didn't want to take lives... Yea, do a body count of the people died on her arrow tip as she went to steal the radio walkie-talkie. Absolutely ruined the scene that toughened her up by the waterfall and her first kill near the cave. She is just a daddy's girl towards the end."
"446",3,"  It was entertaining but had plenty of silliness such as a woman with a bow and arrow taking on guys with machine guns.....successfully. But it was fun and ok entertainment. Lots of action."
"447",2.5,"  Story was not great but there were some fun parts. Lara carries the movie, she seems to be good in everything I have seen her in. Better story could get Part 2 much higher rated."
"448",3.5,"  Great action and good plot. Alicia Vikander crushed this role. I am so in love. This is a flawed movie, but overall it was entertaining and a fun watch."
"449",4,"  Very lucky and indestructible girl, just like in the video game."
"450",5,"  Amazing movie! Alicia Vikander was amazing."
"451",1,"  The movie was just to unrealistic I'm mean at no point of the movie did I feel suspense because the characters could jump of a plane and then run 30 miles per hour not to mention there being a scrappy plot I almost left the Theater because I hated the movie so much spoiler ...............It a Laurel Croft movie not the ya no what the movie was so forgetbel I fort the fathers last name they should have keeled him dead theye was literally no porous for the father to be in the movie I think that it would have been even better if she never knew how her father died it was and all and wast of your money and more importantly the two hours of your life that you spent watching it now don't get me wrong the actress that plaid Laura did a good job in the role but the movie still sucked it was like watching a gif of a cat falling of a tree for two hours go see another movie oh and if you aren't watching this movie please don't go see a wrinkle in time trust me your safer renting at home or simply slamming your face agents the wall for two hours then wasting your time and going to see this movie that's all have to say ??"
"452",0.5,"  Takes a hard shit on an even shitter game series"
"453",1,"  This film is a deception for Lara's fans"
"454",0.5,"  this movie was very bad"
"455",4.5,"  Not the greatest story ever told, but it was at least logical and entertaining. I'd watch it twice and hope for a sequel"
"456",4,"  More action than the previous ones, this establishes Lara Croft's story beautifully. Excellent female action role! Very fast paced, and lacking some of the fantastical elements of the previous two films."
"457",2.5,"  I mean it gives me an Uncharted: Drakes Fortune vibe. Just nowhere near as epic. Still, good acting and stunts."
"458",3,"  The movie was well done, it really feels like the games in a lot of ways. It's not a GREAT film, but it is good. It felt a bit predictable at times. Plot was good, but a bit cliche. I'd give it 6.5-7 out of ten."
"459",4,"  Tomb Raider uses a more realistic and sensible approach to tell a simple story of a compelling protagonist brilliantly played by Alicia Vikander, making the film a lot more entertaining rather than the horrid mess that the franchise was in before."
"460",5,"  I love the way they bring my favourite character to the big screen!"
"461",5,"  deserves better than the 50% Rotten Tomatoe score...The actress playing Lara Croft was great..."
"462",5,"  This reminds me of National Treasure. It is intense and full of adventure too."
"463",3.5,"  entertaining enough. could have had a better script."
"464",5,"  Awesome movie. Lead actress kick some butt...."
"465",4,"  AS A FAN OF THE GAMES, AND THE CHARECTER, I LOVED IT. Alicia WAS PERFECT IN THE ROLE, ACTION WAS GOOD, GOOD CAST, GREAT ORIGIN STORY, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE."
"466",5,"  Better than what Angelina Jolie crapped out."
"467",5,"  I approached this with caution, video game movies being what they are etc. However, this is a stand out, Vikander is excellent and the nods the the game are good and don't break your immersion. My favourite video game movie by a long shot. My only complaint would be some annoying music near the start, it's the type you either love or hate and that not great for the first chase/action sequence."
"468",3.5,"  I would just like to say that it was a pretty good attempt to deliver a good video game adaption.Why they changed Lara's career choice or strayed away so much from the material they had in the game is out of my mind. It would've worked better to follow the game a bit more closely, I get that they needed to fill out the movie with characters since the game has a lot fewer and a lot of solo time going. But it would've been nice to follow her in tombs and solving more puzzles. But they wanted to create something new, easier to follow perhaps? But if they get the chance to do a sequel I think it will be better :)"
"469",3.5,"  3.5 stars. Good solid movie. Extremely good acting job by Alicia Vikander. But... if you were a fan of the 2013 video game then you might be slightly disappointed because the game had a deeper, darker plot. Also, do not expect anything supernatural in this film."
"470",4.5,"  I saw Tomb Raider last night with my wife and a few of our friends and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I believe this is the best adaptation of a video game to film yet. Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance with some great supporting actors in the film. The plot was well done with a little bit of pacing issues during the second act. The costumes were great, the CGI effects were very well done (better than Black Panther imo), and the scenery and shooting of the scenes were great! Highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a fun, action film with great call-backs to the 2012 Tomb Raider video game. 4.5/5 stars"
"471",3.5,"  Great beginning to a great franchise. Not only the great acting but also a better origin story than the first series. If there will be a sequel pretty sure that fans will get to see the ""wealthy, playgirl in shorts with her guns"" type Lara Croft."
"472",3.5,"  Very entertaining! Not just another White hero worshiping movie! Actually, it was but I'm White, so keep'em coming, we want to program the entire world to hero worship us! Loved the action sequences!"
"473",5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great action, great origin story and a great cast. Alicia Vikander really is Lara Croft! Can't wait for the sequel."
"474",4,"  Little slow at points, but was true to the video game without being too campy. Much better then the previous iterations of the film"
"475",5,"  Finally a worth while tomb raider movie. Deff looking forward to more from this actress felt she played rebooted lara perfectly"
"476",5,"  Awesome! I was geeking out massively!"
"477",3,"  On the face of it, Tomb Raider isn't ground-breaking stuff. It's a competent, enjoyable enough blockbuster; a decent popcorn flick, but still hasn't got anything on the likes of Indiana Jones. Still, this is the first time a movie based on a videogame hasn't been flat out bad - so perhaps there's more to praise here than you may think. And judging by the end, a sequel will soon be on the horizon. Let's hope Lara can hit an even bigger target next time out."
"478",5,"  Best game adaption to date and the actor is perfect for the part. Action packed, while it sacrificed a little in screenplay, it more than made up for emotionally invested acting."
"479",3,"  I enjoyed the film, the acting and visuals were fine, but they cheated on the script writing, some terribly written parts."
"480",3,"  It wasn't phenomenally crafted in any aspect, but Alicia Vikander does a great job and by God the movie is just downright fun. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a solid action film. Excited to see where the series goes."
"481",3.5,"  I couldn't believe how close this was to the 2014 video game! Well at least the first quarter of the film was then I have no idea where they were going with it. Alicia Vikander definitely nailed the role a hell of a lot better than Jolie did..those movies were a joke. Vikander definitely held this film together and knew the role of Lara Croft very well, as a gamer and a fan of the Tomb Raider Video Game Franchise, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the film actually was."
"482",5,"  I went to see this movie hoping that it would be better than the originals with Jolie and I came away impressed. I liked the gritty look and feel of the movie. There was none of the campiness of the originals which I was glad to see. With it being basically an origin film, there was some setup in the beginning which was expected but interesting to see her backstory. Once the adventure began, the pacing was excellent all the way to the end. and left the theater impressed. Alicia did an excellent job portraying Lara Croft and her acting was spot on. I will be going to see this movie again."
"483",2,"  This is the kind of movie enjoyed mostly by teens that have never seen that genre type of movie. Alicia is great as is the action and SFX. Definitely a fun 3D Matinee movie for the newbies to the genre. Lesson here, listen to your father."
"484",5,"  I saw the movie after reading the reviews. However, myself and my girlfriend really enjoyed it! I thought the character development was well done, and the story was better than most movies of this nature. Plus I think Vikander was a great choice. Overall, i left feeling entertained and happy with the movie and would recommend it."
"485",5,"  Loved it, action and adventure packed. THISis why you see movies at the theater!"
"486",3,"  As an avid fan of the video games (original and reboot) I was let down. Lara's father story was irrelevant."
"487",3.5,"  Took the family to see this one over the weekend. I was the only one that played the game that this movie is based off of. Overall we were pretty impressed, by far one of the best video game adaptation movies made. It's a fun time, my daughters enjoyed all the girl power, and Alicia Vikander did a great job as always. It's not earth shattering or genre defying/defining but it is a fun time at the movies. My only displeasure and sort of a **SPOILER ALERT** was the removal of supernatural elements that the game had."
"488",4,"  I went into this movie thinking it was going to a pretty good video game flick. It lived up to that expectation and I'd have no qualms watching it again. The movie had several nods to the video game and had a good storyline to keep up a decent pace.There were a couple incongruent character decisions and one or two cheesy lines, but they're inconsequential."
"489",2.5,"  Such a disappointment after the first run. The villain was lame, and all he did was reach for his gun over and over and over. She was not Lara, she was too naive. No, I couldn't stay the whole movie."
"490",5,"  Alicia Vikander does an awesome job as Lara Croft. No really into the whole video game thing, but it doesn't matter, the movie is definitely worth seeing."
"491",5,"  This is why I hate critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Listen, if you're a fan of the Tomb Raider movies and especially the reboot games-- you will have a love for the simplicity of the movie. It was great! It brought back many actual scenes from the Tomb Raider Survivor game and made them real life! Many of my gamer friends went to see it together and all agreed it was light, enjoyable, touching and just an enjoyable experience. I'm going back to watch it again before the opening week ends. Alicia Vikander did an amazing job as Lara without making her whole plot sound and feel cringy and tacky like previous tomb raider movies. This is the best tomb raider movie out to date and you should definitely IGNORE Rotten Tomatoes score and give it a go yourself. Than come back and tell the world what you think :D"
"492",5,"  This movie was awesome and powerful and just all-around fun. Alicia Vikander did an incredible job as Lara, and she REALLY makes you feel like you're right there with Lara feeling everything she feels. Her vulnerability combined with her incredible physical fitness is remarkable to see. Definitely one to watch again and again!"
"493",3.5,"  I honestly enjoyed this movie. I will start out with what I considered the negatives. The screenplay could have used some more work and hopefully if their is a sequel that happens. The villain (while played well by Walton Goggins) needed a better screenplay and maybe some flashbacks of his own? I also wish Daniel Wu got a little more screen time, but maybe they can bring him back in the sequel and explore him more. I really like him in Into the Badlands. Now, for the positives. Vikander owned the role completely. She is the spitting image of the character from the last couple games which is what they are going for. She put tons of work in physically getting fit for the role and doing her own stunts to great effect. And of course he performance was magnetic. She was emotional when she needed to be, fierce when she needed to be, and literally just about perfect. This is what you could hope for when an actor picks up an iconic role. Next, the action in the film was nice. I loved all the action where it bassically just showed her trying to survive (if you consider that action?). I loved it because it showed her awesome stunt work and all those sequences were really thrilling! The ship scene, the chase scene, the river scene, the fight scene where she kills, her bow and arrow run, inside the pyramid/tunnel scenes. Loved those. And it got me hype for a sequel with the ending reveals, and showing her with her Iconic 2 guns."
"494",5,"  If you like the video games and want to see a good representation of that. This is it."
"495",1.5,"  The film does not bring anything new. On the end is quite boring action film, where on many places I was asking my self: ""Why will she do that""."
"496",0.5,"  I'll keep this very simple, slapping the name Tomb Raider does not give permission to make a crappy movie and expect people to pay for it.This movie had plenty of plot holes, the chosen Lara Croft was not the best choice and the CG in this trashy movie is cheap."
"497",5,"  Loved characters and action. Backstory could be better but as fan from games that doesn't bother me personally."
"498",3,"  the movie was entertaining, very like the video game, but it didn't have much staying power"
"499",5,"  Alicia Vikander delivered a memorable performance and was an amazing representation of the Tomb Raider series. The film had so many intense and surprising moments that kept me wanting more! As a huge fan of the video game series, I definitely think the film did justice to the series. The plot change from the rebooted game was a great idea to keep it fresh while also keeping some elements from the game. They even kept some things in the plot and backstory to explore in potential sequels. I look forward to future titles if they continue the on-screen adaptations."
"500",3.5,"  This is a paint by numbers action movie by a director that honestly I feel didnt try to hard to go beyond that. BUT what this movie does have is Alicia Vikander who gives every ounce of her soul to being Lara Croft. The game takes many beats from the rebooted game franchise that gives the movie some of its best set pieces. Vikander makes this movie and deserves more chances to prove that Lara Croft can be a bad ass heroine for this generation."
"501",5,"  Loved it. I though the film is the very best of the Tomb Raider films."
"502",2,"  This movie has so many things going wrong with it - her origin, plot points, dialogue, to name a few - that the few good things are just forgotten. I recommend playing the games."
"503",3.5,"  I enjoyed Tomb Raider. Don't let the low critic scores chase you away.Seriously. Was it some cinematic masterpiece?Of course not. We're talking about latter-day Hollywood here.Was it entertaining? Hell yeah! I had fun and was never really taken out of the movie by anything. So it did its job. It deserved the money I spent on my ticket.I'm not sure why it's suddenly cool to hate on game-tied and comic-tied movies.But go, see it, form YOUR OWN opinion!"
"504",5,"  Fast, straight forward!!!!Alicia Vikander is the best person for this role. Much better than Jolie in my opinion"
"505",5,"  In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone wants to seeIf you like action and mystery, this is the ideal movie for you."
"506",3.5,"  Not amazing, however, quite entertaining movie with a story which follows the game plot closely."
"507",2,"  Even Alicia Vikander is better than Angelina, the movie is very so-so. Waste of time and money."
"508",5,"  This movie is everything a Tomb Raider movie should be. It gives us contemporary Lara Croft in full force, with a new depth to her character that subverts the now outdated Lara known mainly for her big breasts. Like the video games, the story is heavily puzzle-based, the audience led to work them out alongside Lara, which is exactly what I was hoping to see. Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and my whole family had a good time."
"509",5,"  Alicia kicked ass, good story, directed well."
"510",5,"  Clearly, some of the disparities amongst reviews are due to the fact that many reviewers are doing so from the ""video game movie"" point of view, and that's fine.Simply as a free-standing film not related to any video game, however, I found TR to be a highly watchable, entertaining film.In reading many of the reviews here, it seems that - not entirely but by and large - most fans of the video game dislike this second movie version, while far more of those who have not played the game or simply went to see TR on its own merits as a film enjoyed it.For me, I believe this version tells a compelling, granted fantastical story, in a simple, exciting, fast-paced manner. Whereas some might say Jolie's portrayal was more overt and exciting, I felt that Vikander brought a certain subtlety and texture to the role while maintaining the physicality of the first film.Yes, on some levels it's a ""mash-up"" of certain aspects of National Treasure / Raiders / Assassins Creed, and not done as well of any of them, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a very enjoyable film.Is it faithful to the video game? That's for gamer moviegoers to decide and express, and they are right here on RT.But for the rest of us, maybe this TR and Vikander have taken a story to where a new generation of filmgoers who are unfamiliar with TR The Video Game can very, very much appreciate it. I know I did."
"511",4,"  Really enjoyable, I didn't have the highest expectations from viewings of the trailer, but I really enjoyed it. It was my first cinema trip for over a month due to travelling, so it was just the ticket in San Jose, Costa Rica."
"512",1.5,"  With brand recognition of the utmost importance in today's blockbuster landscape, it is no surprise that we're being served up a reboot to a franchise based on a video game. Or maybe it's a prequel? Or a direct adaptation of the game series? It doesn't really matter, because this movie is completely disposable. Serving as an origin story to some degree, this Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a brash adrenaline junkie ready to self-destruct at any moment. She's not yet the gun-toting badass we know she will become, but Vikander has a raw physicality that suits the role. It's a shame then, that she's hamstrung by an astonishingly bad script. ClichÈs abound in a plot that relies on clunky exposition, signposted twists and flimsy character motivation, and that's even before the laughably woeful final act. The action doesn't fare much better either, with the uninspired choreography, choppy editing and undercooked CGI resulting in a complete lack of thrills. This is the sort of lazy action flick where mercenary henchmen wielding semi-automatic weapons miss targets from only a few metres away, and a ridiculous abundance of chokeholds are used to ""raise"" the stakes. But perhaps the biggest atrocity is Walton Goggins' antagonist Mathias Vogel, a villain so disinterested he's practically comatose. At times I thought Goggins was about to break the fourth wall and apologetically explain to the audience that he needed the paycheque to cover some debts. Vikander is clearly trying her hardest but it's ultimately to no avail, Tomb Raider is a yawn-inducing adventure that'll quickly be forgotten."
"513",5,"  Believable and great actress! A very fun movie! Not a perfect one, but in the right direction for video game movies! Go see it!"
"514",4,"  Best video game to movie adaptation so far. Vikander clearly fits the role of the new Lara Croft. Unlike the old movie, the new 2018 reboot cuts away the unrealistic video game fantasy without hurting the source material. I hope to see a worthy sequel to this one!"
"515",4,"  For what the movie is meant to be, it delivered what was promised. The movie excelled at showing what a strong female character looks like. Instead of telling the audience she is strong, the movie shows it through action. I would not rate this as the best movie of all timer,however it is perhaps the best videogame movie, and I would not mind owning it on dvd. Critics rate it at 49%, but are idiots. I would give it a 75%. There was little wrong with the movie, and does nothing to deserve such a lower score."
"516",4,"  An enjoyable popcorn flick. Tomb Raider is strongest when the focus is on either Alicia Vikander or when puzzle/exploration elements are in play, but the film does suffer from a middle act after introducing a character that removes so much of the heroines' ability to focus on herself. Had the film given its time to Lara Crofts need to survive and overcome, this could have easily been an excellent starting film for a franchise. Having said that, I look forward to more from this actress and the world of Tomb Raider if they move on from origins and into some more tomb raiding."
"517",5,"  Tomb Raider (2018) has exceeded my expectations. Alicia Vikander's portrayal of Lara is on point: not only does she humanise her, but she also manages to be a badass, as well."
"518",3,"  ok, not as much fun as old ones"
"519",4.5,"  Great origin story and Roar Uthaug has a really good eye for action."
"520",4,"  I really enjoyed this movie and this rendition of Lara Croft. Some of the puzzles were too conviently solved, but I was entertained throughout the film and I really dug the spin at the end, which was in line with the rebooted video games. I can't wait to see where this film goes next with the sequels. Alicia Vicander is the perfect Lara Croft for this generation of fans."
"521",3,"  Tomb Raider (the movie) doesn't really feel like Tomb Raider (the video game). This film explores the origins of Lara Croft, so the character isn't quite her rich, confident, tough self yet--which makes you feel kind of bad for Alicia Vikander as she's getting beat up by the elements and by other characters. Still, it's an entertaining, though fairly predictable, adventure movie."
"522",3.5,"  Good simple pulpy fun"
"523",4,"  Fun movie - went I; with low expectations based on ""rotten"" score but were pleasantly surprised. Lara needs to work on her scream though. She sounds like a 10 year old when she screams. This movie isn't without faults but is still worth seeing in the theater."
"524",4,"  Alica Vikander makes a great Lara Croft from the 2nd series of the game in this reboot. Some great hat tips to the video games. It's a fun action and adventure movie with a nice plot, good effects and great acting."
"525",4,"  When I first saw the trailers for this, I didn't think she could pull it off, but she did the character justice. Not only that, she looked great doing it."
"526",4.5,"  Excellent movie entertaining"
"527",2,"  The trailer led us to believe that it would follow the fantastic video game closely. It does at first but then it became a huge let down. I kept waiting for the scary elements and supernatural events to happen that took place in the game. But the movie does a complete 180 to remain realistic. If you haven't played the game then the movie might be entertaining. Just another average video game movie/"
"528",4,"  Ineresantes las aventuras de Lara Croft. Nice take. Alicia Vikander pro como siempre."
"529",0.5,"  El guion est· muy mal construido."
"530",3,"  It's an okay action movie although Alicia Vikander is a standout bringing a rare combination of physicality and elegance as the new Lara Croft. Looking forward to seeing where they can take the series with her leading."
"531",5,"  I loved this movie. I would rate it even higher than Black Panther honestly."
"532",2,"  Such a shame that another interesting franchise has devolved into just another shoot-em-up with pretty CGI. The backdrops are great and no lack of action scenes. Characters are cliche and uninteresting (except perhaps for the pawn dealer). Story (do we even care about stories anymore?) felt like an afterthought."
"533",5,"  Very good movie overall! Good modification from the original game!"
"534",4,"  This is a good prequel to the Tomb Raider saga. For fans of the game, especially Rise of the Tomb Raider, you'll recognize many elements from the game. As action movies go, I don't understand the overly critical reviews and definitely side with the audience score (70%) on this one!"
"535",3,"  Incredible, as in not believable. This Tomb Raider is OK and soooo close to being good. Tomb Raider is not inspired by the video games; it is the LC reboot video game. I am fond of Alicia Vikander's work. She is certainly trying to make the best of what she is given here. The problem with this Tomb Raider is mostly in the story construction. It hits all the informational beats, but it is almost frenetic about it. Almost as soon as she is on a boat for the mysterious island, they are having to abandon it. When they could quietly try to evade the evil guards, our heroes quickly get into an avoidable shootout. This movie is a visual storyboard construction, with action scenes at almost every turn. Some of the running-from-danger CG is very video game like and so not believable, it knocked me out the believing the story. TR should have been released mid-summer as mindless entertainment. There are the emotional backstory moments between Lara and her father. The villain is not great, even though the writers give it a go. He has been on the island for 7 years away from his daughters. The time and isolation make him a bit crazy. He complains about not having anyone to talk to, although there appears to be a lot of people under his ""command"" on this island. The intention was to make him come off as complex, but ultimately he a pretty simple bad guy. There are attempts to capitalize on the #girlpower momentum and to be a bit like Wonder Woman, but Croft is no demi-god. She suffers a ""practically"" unrecoverable abdominal wound that should have simply been cut of the story. Croft gets really beat up, by villians and jungle terrain, but seems to come out with only a few scratches, aside from the aforementioned wound. The 2001 Angelina Jolie Raider, introduced us to a Lara who was in command of her money and training to do danger missions. This Vikander bicycle messenger fails to get me to suspend my belief as much. There is an airplane scene where life threatening events are stacked one upon another, during which Croft sums up my issues with this movie nicely by looking straight at the camera and saying ""Really?!"". The best cameo is by Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead). I loved him for his 3 to 4 minutes of footage. The character I am really sorry for is Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu, because in the role reversal, he basically gets sidelined as the almost pointless damsel in distress."
"536",5,"  Go see this fun, thrilling movie! Don't listen to the wanna be critics, the fact that the movie is based on a video game story line doesn't take away from the fact that it is an excellent written and directed action fantasy movie. Go and enjoy it and make your own judgement. You will like it. Definitely."
"537",5,"  Very satisfying movie with great actors!"
"538",4,"  Great reboot. The story could have been a little stronger, but this was a realistic adventure movie with no stupid sarcasm. Believable action scenes and Alicia is a 100% better Lara Croft. I look forward to the next in the series."
"539",5,"  Loved the movie. For someone who didn't play the game this is a story of a great adventure any young rebellious girl would love to be in."
"540",5,"  Possibly the best video game adaptation to date. If you enjoyed the latest two Tomb Raider games, you'll likely enjoy this movie. It's heavily inspired by both games, borrowing pieces of each and then weaving its own story, that still fits nicely in the TR mythos. Alicia Vikander is perfect in the role and is a much more believable Lara than Angelina Jolie ever was, though it probably helps that the character itself is more fleshed out in these ""reboots"" and isn't merely a sex symbol. The film clearly sets up what is hopefully a long and fruitful franchise. I'm certainly looking forward to more!"
"541",4,"  There is no real depth in the scenario, but what is on the screen is working. Nice depiction of the reboot Lara Croft, as well as a variation on the video game. The movie took liberties on some points and it works very well."
"542",0.5,"  They ate an excellent game and barfed up the good bits, changed parts of the story and paired it with a weak squealing tomb raider who was not able to complete one fight the whole movie on her own."
"543",3,"  This is a good movie worth seeing but didn?t give 5 stars and probably is just me but missed Angie In the movie. Guess what I really mean to say is that sense of humor that ran through those movies , she would simply say hmm with that look of hers, after a great one liner gave the movies a feeling of fun. We play games for fun or i do and when that fun is eliminated as much as this adaptation did it lost some of the fantasy that I enjoy."
"544",3,"  A good not great movie that might just might be a turning point for video games being adapted into movies. 74/100."
"545",2.5,"  Pretty good remake , hopefully the sequel will be better"
"546",4,"  I thought they did a pretty good job this time around, hopefully there will be other movies to come."
"547",2.5,"  The movie is good. But the problem with the movie is that it COMPLETELY removes the third act of the game and has a scooby doo moment where they 'rip of the mask' and say, ""OH, it isn't supernatural after all, its just SCIENCE.""I'm sorry, but they should have never left out Himiko being an actual demon queen and her fuedal japan samurai immortal army that is keeping everyone trapped on the island until the curse is broken. Sad part is, the movie is actually good until they scooby doo'd it."
"548",2.5,"  It's nothing we haven't seen Indiana Jones do better 3 times."
"549",4,"  If you play the games you will love this. If you don't this movie is still fun. Alicia kicks ass in this!"
"550",5,"  Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Excellent reboot and eons better Lara."
"551",5,"  Who needs Indiana Jones?"
"552",2,"  Tomb Raider est un film assez rageant dans la mesure o˘ le r√©alisateur parvient √† tirer le meilleur d'un casting particuli√®rement sympathique (Daniel Wu progresse de film en film) et o√π la premi√®re partie est vraiment r√©ussie. En effet, malgr√© ses deux grosses qualit√©s, Tomb Raider s'√©croule totalement quand le film d√©marre r√©ellement son intrigue, aussi inint√©ressante que cousue de fil blanc. De ce fait, Tomb Raider est un film beaucoup trop long, aux effets sp√©ciaux vraiment vilains et avec si peu d'originalit√© qu'il s'oublie bien trop vite."
"553",5,"  Great film. Alicia's performance being the best part about it. Great way of seriously portraying Lara's origin story without taking away from the video games. Great job!"
"554",2.5,"  Adequate... Father daughter story with some action and adventure sprinkled in there, but nothing special even with the toned Vikander on screen."
"555",5,"  I enjoyed this thrill ride from start to finish."
"556",5,"  Just came back from watching Tomb Raider and I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was unsure if we needed another origin story but I guess if they are taking the character in a different direction then it makes sense. Alicia Vikander makes a great Laura Croft and is a more vulnerable character than the previous incarnation. There are elements of the film which are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones which can not be a bad thing. Overall very enjoyable and is set up nicely for a sequel. I took my 11 year old daughter and 14 year son and they both loved the film."
"557",4,"  I thought it was a pretty enjoyable early summer action flick. Everything was pretty well choreographed, the villain filled the role in a serviceable way and I thought Alicia Vikander did a stand-up job (much better than Angelina Jolie)."
"558",5,"  I just got done seeing this movie I am frankly baffled by the bad reviews this movie is getting. I such a fun time viewing this film. The graphics are great. The action is executed exceptionally. Alicia Vikander really steals show. Her acting is above and beyond what would be considered adequate. Honestly, I don't know why I'm not seeing for articles talking about another great female role model being introduced. This Lara Croft is absolutely a better role model for girls than Wonder Woman. Best video game-based movie ever. Awesome"
"559",2.5,"  Fun but way too predictable. I was expecting way more than what it was delivered."
"560",5,"  The story is good it takes alot of the story from the 2013 game does have changes that in my opinion worked well one big difference is a character that's in the game but alot more is done with the character in the movie which I liked other characters from the game that traveled with Lara aren't in the movie but that was fine with me the villain is alright isn't nothing crazy about the villain .alica vikander is really good as Lara croft I loved her. The action is fun the hole movie is fun. The cgi is really good."
"561",4.5,"  If you like the new games and understand where they are going with the story, then you will enjoy this movie. The action is non stop and the effects are great. It's not an award winning movie but it is very entertaining and actors all do very well. I would definitely recommend it and I hope they continue this story."
"562",4,"  Just got back and was skeptical of this reboot and Alicia being cast as Lara Croft but I loved it!"
"563",4.5,"  Great reboot of the franchise! Just what the fans needed. Vikander was amazing and really leveled up Laura Croft with an amazing performance. No lame James Bond gadgets of tired one-liners. Can't wait for the next one!"
"564",3.5,"  This movie was slightly underwhelming as an action adventure film, but next to either of the Jolie films, it looks like a masterpiece of cinema. Vikander makes the role her own for sure, though the script doesn't give her a lot to work with, and the characters and dialogue in general are pretty thin and uninteresting - especially Walter ""can't we just go home"" Goggins antagonist 'Mathias'. The film serves as a good potential kick off for a Vikander run as the character, just not very much else."
"565",4.5,"  Excellent video game adaptation to the big screen. Alicia Vikander is absolutely spectacular as the new Lara Croft. Having played the game series for two decades, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I very much look forward to a sequel!!"
"566",5,"  I Really enjoyed it. Alicia was fantastic as Lara Croft - Bravo. The film was very true to the games."
"567",3,"  As a big fan of the recent Tomb Raider prequel video games Alicia Vikander was phenomenal as a young Lara Croft. More real and relatable for today's gen and a total badass with her share of cuts and bruises - to see this acclaimed dramatic actress pull off such physical grit showcases her strong versatility. However the film underserved her and the game's story caliber (it spent a lot of time exploring the father-daughter relationship instead of more screen time better served on the core story - they hardly infuse the more exciting spirit of mythology, discovery, and learning that makes the game and even the first tomb raider film so enjoyable). It did have some excellent inspired action scenes and combat. It was a decent effort but sad not enough it seems to truly re-ignite great potential and mass interest. I hope they take it next level if it gets a sequel - Alicia definitely deserves it and so does the franchise based on its latest takes."
"568",5,"  Enjoyable movie and don't understand why critics are hating on it. Hands down the best Tomb Raider movie. I enjoyed it and actually excited to see the sequel that was set up at the end of the movie. I love the actress from Ex Macina."
"569",4,"  It was pretty good, I liked that it tied up all the loose ends of how Lara became Lara. I liked that it wasn't supernatural like the other ones, this had a believable antagonist. Should be a good franchise if they keep this up."
"570",4.5,"  Vikander gets an A+ for depicting a believable as possible video game character. I'm not a gamer but could see the storyboard imagery underlying every scene. The zing was there in every shot. Emotional focus on finding her father remained real, lensing merged seamlessly with CGI. A little more story/emotional involvement of supporting characters would have made the film that tad bit better, but this is a great franchise reboot. The tone was Indiana Jones meets Mission Impossible. Vikander is Ethan Hunt!"
"571",3,"  Loved Alicia, liked the movie. Overall it was fun with a lackluster villain. Reminded me of Last Crusade mixed with The Rundown."
"572",3.5,"  What could have ended up as just a formulaic action film is elevated due to Alica Vikander, who plays her role perfectly"
"573",4,"  Great movie! Keeps on track with the classics. Fun and kick ass. Everything you could want."
"574",4,"  Nothing great, but jeez, alicia is hot in this movie!!!"
"575",5,"  Love the game!! Movie is awesome!!"
"576",2.5,"  It was an good movie. It went by the source material but i was disappointed that they just got rid of the games main cast and the whole fact himiko was Keeping them on the island. It really needed more of Lara fighting for her survival and less of her randomly joining the enemy. The worst thing about this movie is the fact her father is just there. He's alive and him and Lara are happy. But then Lara solves every puzzle and Richard just blew everything up. Overall solid film"
"577",5,"  It was a much better version compared to the 2001 movie-- much better for young girls to see. not over sexualized."
"578",4,"  Despite a few choices that I wasn't crazy about, I really enjoyed Roar Uthaug's take on the Tomb Raider franchise. It's a fun action film, and it does a great job of filling the ""Indiana Jones""-sized hole in the adventure genre that's been there since ""The Last Crusade"" in 1989. I don't think that the film trods wholly new ground, but I do feel that it does a pretty good job of setting up Lara Croft's world. Alicia Vikander is really terrific in the role, regardless of what you may think of the story, and I'm really hoping that we'll see another outing with her as Lara."
"579",5,"  Love it! Would go and see it again if I had more money"
"580",2.5,"  Lara CROFT was excellent. Too bad the story was so boring. I love how at moments it really felt like a video game. but the action wasn't very exciting for me."
"581",4,"  This is one Rotten tomatoes is getting wrong, don't listen to the critics and go see this action packed well acted movie. If your a fan of the games you'll enjoy this adaptation, if your not familiar with the games it doesn't matter, you'll still enjoy it."
"582",5,"  The kickass Lara Croft we deserve!"
"583",5,"  This reboot is so much better than first 2 movies"
"584",1.5,"  Easy watch - very Indiana Jones just not quite as good"
"585",3.5,"  Very fun movie, Alicia Vikander is aweseome. This is probably the best video game movie out there."
"586",2.5,"  nothing special lot of jumping and grabbing followed by some very dry dialog that seemed forced then more jumping spinning and grapping I recommend you just get the old game out and play"
"587",3,"  Tomb Raider, starring Alicia Vikander as video game character Lara Croft, is a fun enough adventure movie. Lara's father vanished years ago and she is being pressured to have him declared dead and take his place at the head of the family business. But being the rebellious millennial that she is, she has been refusing to believe he is actually dead. As she is finally almost convinced to accept his death, she finds a clue to where he had gone and so the adventure begins.The film is extremely reminiscent of Indiana Jones and the Final Crusade, which is not surprising. After all, the Lara Croft Tomb Raider games have been referred to before as a female Indiana Jones. The movie hits all the beats of the old adventure serials. It has a spunky hero, eye-catching scenery, exciting action scenes, and a slimy villain. I'm not at all saying it's badly done, just that it's a typical adventure flick. Alicia Vikander is a good Lara Croft. She carries off the physicality of the character and yet shows a certain vulnerability which makes you believe that she has to work at it. I was never bored during Tomb Raider and left the theater feeling satisfied having spent my time with it. I just hope that if it becomes a tentpole series, that they find more inventive storylines."
"588",3.5,"  I thought it was better than I anticipated. Some things were predictable and some were a little too convenient. But all in all it was an entertaining movie and it also humanized Lara Croft which the franchise needed. I liked the grittiness the producers tried to portray."
"589",3.5,"  thought this was a very entertaining, fun loving good pop corn movie. I don't know why the Critics are trashing this movie. It is a fun time worth the money I spent last night. It is a great reboot and Is the best of the Tomb raider movies (which may or may not be saying much to sum). But I hope they make more of them. I love that them made her a plain person that made mistakes. I lovethat it has all the video game type adventures. No it is nothingoscar worthy or a breakthrough in film making. But it is a fun all around good time. Go to the theater grab some popcorn and just set back and enjoy."
"590",4,"  Excellent movie. It has Action, Adventure, Mythology, Magic/Mystery, Puzzles. It's not perfect, at the beginning it has a pretty funny & silly plot but after the first act it rises surprisingly. The best film after Indiana Jones (it's not a comedy like the other movies of this genre, this one is really dark & serious). Photography & Landscape are beautiful. OST is great & immerse you in this fascinating world. I want to watch a second part now. I am really excited."
"591",4,"  Was a really good action movie. I think it could have developed the characters a bit more, but for what it was I liked it."
"592",3.5,"  vikander was a great choice.. the video movie changes key aspects of the video game story that make no sense.. but the movie does hit the feel and tone of the game.. overall a great watch but the games story was much better.."
"593",3.5,"  I thought this was a very entertaining, fun loving good pop corn movie. I don't know why the Critics are trashing this movie. It is a fun time worth the money I spent last night. It is a great reboot and Is the best of the Tomb raider movies (which may or may not be saying much to sum). But I hope they make more of them. I love that them made her a plain person that made mistakes. I lovethat it has all the video game type adventures. No it is nothingoscar worthy or a breakthrough in film making. But it is a fun all around good time. Go to the theater grab some popcorn and just set back and enjoy."
"594",3.5,"  Much Like the vIdeo gaMe the New tomb raide"
"595",4.5,"  I liked it, followed the reboot of the videogame franchise. I love this lara, movie could use a little less choppy 3d action in some scenes but as far as fantasy goes. pretty good"
"596",2.5,"  my major problem with this movie was when she decided to help the bad guys for no particular reason against all advice from her father that would result in the end of the world... where is the motivation in movies these days? its like they dont bother any more. felt like game fan service but i did appreciate the first blood feel it had at very few points, wish they had kept that theme going. i think the film could have benefited from showing the grueling pain and incessant punishment against the odds, like the games. (kinda like how die hard did it). less puzzles and myths and a bit more brutal death defying imo."
"597",3.5,"  F@ck the critics, this move was so much fun. And Alicia Vikander was fantastic."
"598",5,"  I haven't played the games and I didn't see it with Angelina Jolie because it had Angelina Jolie in it, but the trailer looked fun so I went. I was pleasantly surprised. I was reminded of the excitement of Indiana Jones. I hope they make a sequel, but not try and follow the game."
"599",4,"  Solid adventure movie, didn't expect too much and it might have exceeded my expectations a little bit. Sheri mentioned she thought Lara Croft was a bit wimpy."
"600",2.5,"  Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft works brilliantly, But the story suffers from many plotholes and too many unexplored storylines. Yes, it does stick to the video game, and it does a good job at that, but the movie also ewokes zero emotion and no investment."
"601",2.5,"  Poor story, poor writing, only thing that rescues this film is good action scenes."
"602",3,"  This is a much grittier and realistic portrayal of the Tomb Raider franchise. No campy hero poses or expressions, and the first scene shows Lara getting owned in a boxing match. I found myself enjoying it as a pure action/drama piece, and forgetting it was even based on a video game. My only issue is that I just can get behind Alicia Vikander being Lara Croft for purely superficial reasons. I don't think she has the right look, and I'm not talking about her cup size. Lara is supposed to be stunningly beautiful, and Alicia just seems kind of ""dopey"" looking and short. I much would've preferred Keira Knightley, or someone who can hold an elegant beauty regardless of camera angle. Sorry to sound cruel, but as someone who was playing Tomb Raider back in the late 90s, I remember when Rhona Mitra was the first Tomb Raider live action model, and hoped to see someone of that caliber."
"603",4,"  It's narrative is by no means groundbreaking, but Vikander is simply breathtaking in the role - a performance that brings vulnerability and determination to the screen with such ease. Recommended for fans."
"604",4,"  The new origin story may not be up to much, but Alicia Vikander proves that you don't need giant breasts to be a fantastic Lara Croft. Vikander makes the character believable and personable, despite Lara's new attitude to her wealth. Fear not though, as by the end of the film we find her ready to take on both her heritage and her new destiny. This sets up the new series of films and is hampered by its very nature as an origin story, but as a launching point into future stories it is just what fans of Tomb Raider need."
"605",4,"  Really enjoyed the movie - at first I didn't want to see after I checked out the reviews but after seeing it I'm glad I didn't boycott Tomb Raider."
"606",3,"  Alicia Vikander surprised me, what can you not do? Stealing every scene, she's beyond fierce and brave. The supporting cast was good, and it was an escape from reality. Was it as good as Tomb Raider with Angelina Jolie? No. Is it along the lines in subject and theme as Raiders of the Lost Ark? Yes. But in no way compares. [3.0 stars]"
"607",4.5,"  Fun action flick. Definitely an improvement over the originals. I really like the new Lara. Hope we get some more in the series."
"608",5,"  This movie is definitely worth seeing if you like high intensity action packed fly by the seat of your pants movies. Loved everything about it. Once again the critics show that they hate women if they are not sex objects like in Marvel movies."
"609",3.5,"  the best movie based on a videogame yet"
"610",5,"  best video game movie ive seen amazing action."
"611",5,"  Enjoyed every second of this film, a few refrences to the games, a nod to indiana jones, an all out adventure! Sure it could be better as it was a tad predictable, but non-the less I loved it, Would recommend."
"612",4.5,"  I don't know what's wrong with these critics. This movie certainly does NOT deserve to be lumped into the ""splat"" category. I've played both of the newest reboot games, While it doesn't quite meet the true essence of the games, how could it anyway? you would be trying to fit at least 48 hours of game-play into a 2 hour movie. It does have a promising story line, pretty decent special effects, and keeps you wanting more. I have seen a LOT more badly presented video game movies then this. It's also important to note that I have seen a lot of poor biased comments made to reflect the entire movie based alone on the appearance of the actress playing Lara (Alicia Vikander.) If that is your only hang up, don't review movies, you obviously don't know what you are doing. And it is a pretty immature basis for a rating an entire movie. The movie is based on Lara's origins, even the 2010 PC game portrays Lara as an age that could be classed as pre-adult. The audience rating of 70% is the correct rating. 49% and a splat is an insult. IMDB has a better class of rating. I'm actually quite disappointed that Rotten Tomatoes is so corrupt in it's reviews. I am a long time user of this site as a guide in choosing quality movies. And this movie makes me wonder what hidden gems of movies I've missed in the past. If you're trying to figure out weather you should watch this movie or not. DO IT! It's worth the money. I would pay to see it again."
"613",2.5,"  Just been to see Tomb Raider or as will ever be known as Lara Croft and the Last Crusade as it has the EXACT same plot as the 3rd Indy movie. Father goes missing? Check. Father leaves behind diary leading to a McGuffin? Check. And that's not all but to say anything else would be giving away spoilers. It's not terrible. And Vikander holds the film together. The action scenes are ok and do feel like scenes from a video games. Although at times they were either poorly edited or it's too dark to see what's going on (that might have been due to the 3D we saw it in). It does try desperately to set up a sequel at the end but I have a feeling this will be Vikander's only outing."
"614",2,"  a popcorn movie. I was wondering that why Croft so strong? She not even die when she was falling from the rock to river"
"615",3,"  un bon film d'aventures et alicia vikander tient bien le role ."
"616",3,"  I found this movie fun, our heroine is meant o be smart however but keeps making odd decisions that suggest she is dumb, a better story would have fixed that.The acting was OK and Vikander worked.The main mistake though is badly executed continual jeopardy for some scenes, you will have seen the scene from the trailer where she runs along the rusted plan wing on a waterfall? Well, its part of a long, long, action sequence and eventually you stop caring, the tension is lost and you just want to move onto the next scene.In fact you can almost hear the changes in the script being discussed in your head, ""she is winning this fight at the moment, lets inexplicably turn that around to keep the tension up even though it will feel unlikely and the guy she is fighting should be in shock by now, the audience will really appreciate the extra tension""Also their is a line by her bike courier colleague early on about her character quoting Shakespeare, so why would she possibly be a bike courier, the obvious problem with this is this other character is a bike courier and knows Shakespeare, very odd choice really, because its those little things building up that stop people getting into the film, despite the professional critics coming up with other explanations, that's the stuff that takes you out of it."
"617",5,"  Really enjoyed it. Alicia was fantastic as Lara Croft. The film was very true to the games. The reviews dont seem to fairly reflect the film IMO."
"618",1,"  If you want a campy adventure movie, watch Raiders of the Lost Ark. If you want banter between an adventurer and his tough-as-nails offspring, watch Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. If you want a special effects fueled origin story, watch one of the many Marvel movies. If you want a hamfisted, obvious plot twist intended purely to set up a sequel, watch any teen thriller. If you want a pointless Cornetto Trilogy cameo, watch Force Awakens.If you want a sad, uninspired, and poorly acted mishmash of all the above, or if you want to completely waste your time and money for some masochistic reason, watch Tomb Raider."
"619",4.5,"  As an avid fan of the Tomb Raider franchise I had very strict, and admittedly biased, expectations for the newest Tomb Raider film. To my incredible delight, the film was nowhere near a disappointment, hitting every note flawlessly! From the very onset Vikander comes across as the perfect updated version of Lara Croft. Her performance of the eponymous character is one I hope to see in many more sequels down the road. The story flowed quite nicely keeping the main characters to a minimum really helped me to connect to them each on a small level all without distracting from the excitement on screen. Beyond the fact that the first game I ever played on the Sony Playstation was the first Tomb Raider game, way back when, I found myself really routing for Lara and at times even being concerned for her; after all who among us that played 2013's Tomb Raider reboot can forget the many visceral ways that Lara can be injured and even killed?Tomb Raider is a visually stunning picture that displays a wide color palate that never comes across as anything beyond what we see on a day to day basis. Roar Uthaug knew exactly how this film should be made and the direction was on point. While hitting all the highlights from the aforementioned 2013 reboot of the game franchise, the film has a very grounded feel that makes you think ""this isn't as far fetched as it sounds"" while keeping the adventure and puzzle solving essence of the Tomb Raider games firmly in place. In conclusion, I absolutely adored Tomb Raider and will be going to see it again this weekend for a matinee. 4.5 stars. Go see it, and bring a friend!Lessons learned: Reclaim your items from the local pawnbroker.Inspired ideas: Fox hunting. ;)"

"621",4,"  Alicia Vikander is amazing. She commited so much physically to this role and it shows. Most games adapted from videogames fall flat on their faces and either try too hard or not hard enough. Tomb Raider was both enjoyable and exciting to watch. I would love to see Vikander back again in the role and kicking more asses. From a filmmaker stand point it was entertaining and well created. I cared about the characters and their motivations. Set design was great. And they really captured the essence of the newest games. Overall; the movie was a fun ride. Kept me wondering what would happen next. And for the cherry on top it is the amazing Alicia Vikander in the role. What else could you ask for?The ONLY reason this isn't a 4.5 or maybe even a 5 to me is because I think it would be best as an R rated film. Lets get gritty people!"
"622",1.5,"  Terrible Movie. The best part about it was how laughable it was. Even with movie pass I regret seeing it. Bad story. Bad directing. Basically just a movie showing how well this girl is at taking falls and holding on to things."
"623",3,"  Surprisingly decent reboot. Enjoyed it more than the original. Alicia is a better Lara than Angelina."
"624",3.5,"  This is Best movies from video games 7/10 Drama isn't good , But action scences is good."
"625",4,"  They took a video game and adapted it to the big screen. That's hard to do, period. That being said, I personally thought it wasn't bad. I liked it. I wouldn't say it was the most amazing movie i have ever seen, but gosh Laura is one heck of a woman! The woman power in this movie was incredible. Loved it. Based off a video game or not, any woman who can outrun a bunch of male bike riders, and fight off a bunch of men with guns armed with a bow and arrow deserves my respect. Positive role model in a B movie. Thumbs up!"
"626",4.5,"  Fun film that pays tribute to the game."
"627",5,"  Fun action-adventure movie that should have been better rated by the critics. The audience has it right here, it's a solid 70%."
"628",3.5,"  Shows that critics are out of touch with audiences when they give something like this with a largely heartfelt story and a lead you can care about that kind of rating and something with terrible characters like the Last Jedi so so much more.I bet audience score for this one stays around the 70-75 it has now, It's not perfect, but it is only let down a little in the pacing and execution. Touches here and there and it would be really great. Splash more colour in the palette, some snappier dialogue, slightly deeper plot. I hope she gets a second outing to try to get the character somewhere really special."
"629",5,"  Fun movie, enjoyable with the family"
"630",4,"  Enjoyed this. Wish shows would be linger to be able to tell.more of a story."
"631",1,"  This is not an action-adventure movie, it is more in line with a drama movie and slow to start."
"632",4,"  Good fantastic movie starring Alicia Vikander, Walton Goggins and nick frost. I watched the original tomb raider movies with Angelina jolie and they for me set the bar for video game movies but now we have a new tomb raider movie and it just raised the bar higher because tomb raider is the best video game movie ever. I can't wait to watch it again and when watching the trailer I knew that this movie would be great and it is. Yes this movie has a ton of flaws but in the end Alicia Vikander is a better laura croft than Angelina jolie."
"633",5,"  It was truly amazing and such a good film. this should have way higher ratings."
"634",3.5,"  Overall the Tomb raider has a great performance from Vikander, some good action and character moments, perhaps underrated fight scenes, a capable supporting cast, and a decent concept, with underwhelming dialogue and underdeveloped plot, a couple inconsistencies and some less than preferable choices. This isn't a great movie by any means, but I believe it has enough good elements that its worth checking out. Especially if you are a fan of the newer games, action movies, or can look past smaller problems, you should have a good time."
"635",1,"  Absolutely god awful crap....It's pretty sad what the studios pump out and ask us the audience to pay the same ticket price for this rubbish and say a great film like 3 Billboards....I walked out 1/2 way through.....It's a shame they had to give this gal who played Lara complete garbage to work with"
"636",4,"  Finally a video game based movie that doesn't suck! Alicia Vikander was a great Lara Croft, lots of action and Walton Goggins was great too.Took my 12 year old granddaughter, she loved it. We went home and she dug out my copy of the remastered PS4 Tomb Raider game and played it for almost 3 hours!If you are a fan of the games then you will most likely enjoy the movie."
"637",0.5,"  I knew what would happen after every moment."
"638",5,"  Great adaptation of the game storyline to the silver screen. The actress did a fantastic job getting ready for the part of Lara Croft in making her actions in the movie believable. Edge of the seat action that is a great start for a nice series of movies to come. Excellent film!"
"639",3,"  The movie industry continues it's run of dodgy video game adaptations with their latest incarnation of Tomb Raider, this time with Miss Croft's action boots filled by Alicia Vikander. An excellent actress in her own right, AV is easily the best thing about the film. She plays it completely different from how Miss Jolie did back at the turn of the millennium, due to this outing being based on the 2013 videos game rather than the series from the 90s. I haven't played any of the recent ones, and so had no way to compare it, but there's a fair share of both high and low points. The acting is good, the story is not. The action can be enjoyable, the editing never is. Many of the scenes of running and fighting are shot so poorly and edited so choppily that you'll swear you're watching a Michael Bay movie. I appreciate the fact that there's no attempt to oversexualise Lara, and she can just be a likable lead without having to pander to drooling teens, but she's often relegated to the status of a side character, with the supporting cast given more of a central role than she ever is. It's got a pretty good climax, and the surprise towards the end caught me off guard, but too much of the plot is convoluted and doesn't add up to a great deal. I'd watch it again if given the chance, and certainly wouldn't write it off as worthless junk. It just feels like a lot of talent has been underutilised, and the resulting product should have been so much more than it turned out to be."
"640",5,"  Great special effects and storyline. Perfect actress for the role. I'd say it's better than the game!!"
"641",5,"  I liked this better than Black Panther, and I liked Black Panther."
"642",5,"  Anxiety was high throughout the whole movie.... LOVED IT."
"643",3,"  It followed the 2013 remake of the game, but only its plot. It didn't follow much of anything else. For me, it's not a bad game, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype."
"644",5,"  Everyone has their own opinion on what is good that's why we never listen to critics. I go to a movie to be entertained whether it be action, drama, Sci-fi. If the movie keeps me in my seat It is worthy. Alicia and the cast kept me in my seat for a fun ride. A great choice to reboot the franchise."
"645",5,"  Wasn't sure what to expect but I loved Alicia Vikander as the young Lara Croft. I don't play video games so can't speak to that but I do go to an occasional movie. I enjoyed this much more than the panther movie. Panther was like watching a NY Broadway play. Lara Croft was much more gritty. Totally enjoyed."
"646",2,"  Was it really necessary to re-boot the franchise this way? The plot is bad, acting regular and I missed sorely the action-packed rythm of the previous movies."
"647",2.5,"  It is a fine reboot. The story and action sequences could have been improved."
"648",2,"  angelina jolie is tomb raider,this is bullshit"
"649",5,"  I walked in with low expectations and walked out really glad I saw this movie."
"650",4,"  For someone who enjoyed the video games growing up. I believe they did a great job concidering cramming the game into a well timed movie. Video game movies usually turn out bad. Well I think this is the best one. Now I did have background knowledge of the character, but I took my sister to this movie. She hates video games and I only convinced her to come with me to see it is because she likes Indiana Jones. My sister is also also known for sleeping in a movie theatre if the film if boring and doesn't keep her interested. In her words she followed along well, she wasn't confused with the plot, there was a lot of action like an Indiana film and she stayed awake through the whole film."
"651",4,"  Vikander played Croft with a self-assured confidence that bordered on arrogance (taking risks without hesitation, even when her life didn't depend on it), and it was probably the best part of the film. The story left something to be desired, but the interactions between characters were really enjoyable to watch. As a fan of the game, I thought the film really captured the essence of the puzzles and chase sequences that I loved to play as a kid. I think it delivered what it promised--a fun, action-filled adventure movie--and I would see a sequel, provided they put a little more thought into the story."
"652",5,"  best video game adaption to date. I thought it was great"
"653",5,"  Way better than reviews give it credit."
"654",4.5,"  4.5 posiblemente la mejor adaptaci√≥n de un juego recientemente"
"655",5,"  It was a good flick. I liked out better than the original tomb raider.... more believable storyline in places, well balanced action scenes."
"656",3.5,"  Alicia Vikander is believable as Lara Croft the story line is difficult because obviously they are trying to flesh out the character completely. Future Lara Croft films if there are more in the works with Alicia as the lead should very interesting because the building blocks have been placed already for the character. A good story line to entertain is all that is need now for future films."
"657",5,"  Loved the movie. Was a great reboot to the series. Definitely the best video game movie to date. Cannot wait for the sequel"
"658",3,"  omb Raider es una pel√≠cula entretenida! No fue hecha para ganar un Oscar pero merece que la audiencia le d√© una oportunidad y la valore por lo que es, una pel√≠cula y no un videojuego. Si usted la quiere calificar compar√°ndola con cualquiera de las versiones que ha jugado, es muy probable que le de una calificaci√≥n muy baja. Al verla aparte de cualquier otra presentaci√≥n, la encuentro aceptable y espero que reciba la oportunidad de una secuela. Me muero de ganas por ver lo que hacen con Alicia Vikander en el futuro. En mi opini√≥n, esta es mucho mejor que las pel√≠culas que vimos en el 2001 y en el 2003."
"659",1,"  I walk out the minute a scene reveal they rewrote the games plot, I'm sorry rewriting the games plot is not clever, it's lazy to say the least"
"660",3.5,"  I thoroughly ejoyed the movie. Lara was played by a better actress than Jolie was. The story was pretty good. It reminded me more of the video game action, which of course its based on."
"661",5,"  Great delivery! Not a single moment was devoted to boredom. Cannot wait for the sequel. People, you can ignore the tomatometer and the top critics on this one, they can stay home and solve puzzles instead, may be they will get happiness that way. Follow the audience score!!"
"662",3.5,"  I wasn't expecting it to be this good. But it had interesting story concept and a lot of ""indiana jones"" like action. Actress was believable too and you cared about the characters."
"663",4,"  I love that Laura is not invincible, but she can still rise up."
"664",4,"  Starts slowly and improves as it goes on. Very entertaining."
"665",3,"  It was fun. and reminded me of the original Mummy movies with Brendan Fraser. While I won't say it's a movie I'll come back to, or put in nay must watch list. I felt it was a faithful and good adaptation of the more recent games. I would definitely catch any sequels."
"666",4,"  If you are a fan of the game, you'll lve this movie!"
"667",4,"  The movie was a joy to watch. Alicia did a great a job with the role. The shooting was pretty nice i liked the way they made Lara ""human"" making her a person like everybody else, you can clearly see this in the opening boxe scene and when she was robbed in japan. The story line could've been better. All sumed up, a greate movie and a great reboot to the franchise."
"668",1,"  Boring and predictable...cheesy and I like the actress in other films but she is whiny the whole film and lacks chemistry with the characters and plot after she goes off on her adventure."
"669",4,"  Watching this was a lot of fun. It's also grueling. Lara is so tough and clever-nobody is on her level-and Vikander is incredibly charismatic as the lead. She owns the part. I want to see it again."
"670",5,"  So much better than the first two Lara Croft Movies"
"671",5,"  In my opinion Tombraider FINALLY break the videogame curse by actually being an amazing movie. Fans of the latest games will be blown away with how much sincere passion was put into bringing Lara to the screen. In an era of amazing comicbook adaptions it's about time videogames shared in the glory, and I feel Tombraider ushers in that era."
"672",2,"  Ugh, I don't know why, but I really hated this movie! The acting was okay, but some of the action scenes are disjointed and hard to follow or believe. I just thought the whole thing was ridiculous."
"673",5,"  This movie is amazing. It's got everything: interesting plot, amazing characterization and it was a great adaptation of the video game. Alicia Vikander played an amazing Lara Croft who's just beginning to find out what her father worked for and where he could possibly be. There's no unnecessary love story, once the love Lara has for her father is the only thing to care about. It clearly shows that a woman is up for any task and she delivers well. Lara's brain and abilities are the focus of this movie and it's an inspiration for every single young woman to follow. I 100% recommend this movie."
"674",4,"  The movie is for the hard core LC gamers"
"675",5,"  WOW. As a person who's never played (Or been interested in playing) the tomb raider games, I came in with No idea of what to expect. I didn't even know Trinity's motives. And I came out with this in my mind: 11/10."
"676",5,"  Very fun movie, don¥t listen to the critics. My girlfriend abd I had a blast with this one. GIVE IT CHANCE, AND MAKE YOUR OWN MINDS"
"677",5,"  I am blown away. I hoped it would be half way decent, but let's be real, video game adaptations don't have the best track record. But Tomb Raider exceeded my expectations! It was REALLY good! This is a solid action adventure film in the vein of Indiana Jones meets National Treasure meets the Hunger Games. It's a fun time. You don't have to know anything about the character in order to enjoy it... but if you DO love the game series, you are in for a real treat. THIS is how you do VG adaptations.The acting is top notch and a big reason this film succeeds. Combine that with a fast pace, good world building, solid supporting characters, and the bravery to NOT jump the shark with the story... and you have a winning combo on your hands. Go see it! You will not be disappointed!"
"678",5,"  Great movie and adaptation from the video game. Alicia Vikander was a believable hero and played the part perfectly."
"679",4,"  I don't quite like the ladder seen, and would have done something a little different, but other than that, loved everything about it."
"680",5,"  Lots of great action. I associated with the game more also. Alicia played a great Lara. The story wasn't all that bad!"
"681",2.5,"  The whole plot of meaningless."
"682",5,"  I thought it was a pretty good movie. The story was darker and deeper than the previous Tomb Raider movies. Vikander appears to be more like the game character from the recent games than Jolie did with the previous incarnation. I like that this depicts how she became the Tomb Raider rather than just picking up after she is established. For someone not familiar with the games, this would be more realistic for them."
"683",4.5,"  If you are a fan of the video game you will appreciate this movie."
"684",0.5,"  Dry foolishness. The best part about the film was the end (the credits). Film really wanted me grieving for Angelina Jolie to come back"
"685",4.5,"  Much better than expected. Great movie coming from the 2013 game. You shouldn't compare it to the Angelina Jolie movies tho. See it as a new beginning."
"686",5,"  Amazing movie just like in the Game! Don't know why got score so low like this . Really really worth to see! I love it!"
"687",5,"  Very entertaining with very little language and no sexual overtones or crudity. It has suspenseful action scenes and some graphic violence."
"688",3,"  For a long time now Hollywood has been struggling to answer the age old question, ""Is it possible to make an honest to God, good movie based on a video game?"" Tomb Raider answers this question with a resounding - sort of. The good news is: this is easily the best ""Movie based on a Video Game"" ever made. The bad news is: all that really means is, it's better than Prince of Persia. I'll be honest, I had serious doubts about Alicia Vikander as an action hero. However I am happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong. Whereas Jolie's Lara Croft was essentially an impression of Roger Moore at his campiest, Vikander's Lara Croft is a straight up badass in the tradition of Sarah Connor. Her performance is the engine that drives this film and keeps you invested when things inevitably get pretty silly. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug (who directed the fantastic Cold Prey) does a solid job with the action and set-pieces, and keeps things moving just fast enough to keep you from thinking to hard about the actual plot, which owes more than a little to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This is clearly meant as a Casino Royale/Batman Begins of sorts for the franchise, but lets be clear: at the end of the day all Tomb Raider is aiming to be is a fun, action adventure, B-movie in the vein of Indiana Jones. If any of that sounds bad to you, well you should probably avoid this movie. But if not, there's some fun to be had here."
"689",5,"  Highly recommend it to anyone who likes action-adventute movies. Alicia was a great Lara"
"690",3,"  Solid action flick.I'm surprised this film got a lot of weak reviews from professional reviewers.Script made sense and kept me interested. Fun action sequences. They tried some neat new things here: an action sequence involving a ladder, a tomb trap, and the revelation of the what the prize they're searching.Vikander and the rest of the cast all do a good job. (Surprised they got Derek Jacobi for a minor role that anyone could have played.) I heard complaints that Walton Goggins didn't play a more magnetic antagonist like he did in any films. However, I think this spoke to his ranger. I though it was a nice change of pace to play a nasty, desperate man who attempts to put on a thin veil of normalcy.Camerawork was interesting. They went with a Daniel Craig-James Bond shaky-cam/psuedo documentary feel to it which I felt made the film feel more grounded than some action movies without making the film feel like it was trying too hard to be realistic. The nighttime and cave scenes were too dark, though."
"691",5,"  Awesome movie, Alicia plays a true to the reboot video game Lara. Can't wait to the future sequels"
"692",5,"  Top, top film. The critics are being pathetic."
"693",4,"  Good adventure movie."
"694",4,"  it's been over 20 years since the Tomb Raider games made their mark on pop cultureafter 2 films and a rebooted version for the next generation of players Lara Croft makes her way back to the big screen in a whole new wayAlicia Vikander takes on the iconic role but starting with her origin story before becoming the infamous Tomb Raider the filmmakers borrow a lot of elements from the 2013 version of the games and it's truly rooted more in a rougher, grittier, more real-world settingLara's father has gone missing after 7 years looking for a magic empress named Himiko on an island called Yamatai, he also left his research found by a militant group called Trinity seeking to control all humankindat first Lara wants nothing to do with her inheritance but after finding a clue about his discovery she believes he may still be aliveshe then charters a course to find the island in the middle of the ocean and is captured by a man named Mathias Vogel who wants to find the tomb to get back home but unleashing something deadly in the processLara then finds out the danger her father was put in to conceal it from TrinityVikander commands the screen playing Lara Croft; she's tough, strong, resilient, and can take a beating in any shape or form whether jumping from a crashed plane or learning to take up archery Dominic West expertly plays her father always thinking of her despite the fact that he left to keep her safe and she just wants him to come homeWalter Goggins as Mathias believes he's not doing any harm to the world but only to find this tomb so he can make it back, he's also very dismissive of the line between reality and myth, he's a decent enough antagonistthe film has some very intense action scenes, picks up the pace after the first half, and could ultimately create a new franchise if the filmmakers play their cards rightAngelina Jolie kept up the adventurous, sex-symbol image of Lara at the time but with Vikander Tomb Raider can now be this action heroine for young boys and girls braving the elements while valuing the family ones, toothis is a true sign of hope as far as video game-to-film adaptations golet's pray they can keep it that way"
"695",3,"  Buena ambientaciÛn y adaptaci√≥n del videojuego, a a√±os luz de las bastante lamentables pel√≠culas de Angelina Jolie. Buen papel de la protagonista, que encarna a una magn√≠fica Lara Croft. El invento se estropea con un gui√≥n en el que han pretendido recrear el videojuego ""Tom Raider"" de 2013 con el que se relanz√≥ la franquicia, un gran producto que contaba una magn√≠fica historia que se desarrollaba en muchas horas de juego, algo imposible de condensar en 2 horas, y eso se ha dejado notar y mucho. Te tiras dos horas esperando que la historia te enganche como la del videojuego, y simplemente no lo consigue, ya que todo queda demasiado inconexo por un mero problema de falta de tiempo. Lo mejor: esta chica, Alicia Vikander, hace que te creas que ella es Lara Croft en carne y hueso, ojal√° vuelva con un gui√≥n que le haga justicia al personaje y a ella misma."
"696",5,"  Giving lara a origin story was so amazing! This is one of the best movies to come onto the silver screen in 2018! Alicia is amazing! Lara is a kickass super star! I seriously can't wait to see what adventures lara will go on next!!"
"697",1,"  Disappointed, was expecting a strong badass sexy independent woman, not a wimpy posh girl who didn't make any of it believable or interesting. The trailers made it look like a decent tomb raider film but it It was very slow and boring and nothing like the video games I preferred the Angelia films,Waste of time and money"
"698",5,"  I enjoyed this film a great deal, a fun and intense adventure film that channels Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade better than any adventure film has since its release. The fact that critics were mixed shows how far why've fallen down the rabbit holes of their own self-importance. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed."
"699",5,"  i think it was nearly a perfect videogame adaptation."
"700",4,"  Exactlty the strong female lead we've been waiting for - strong, smart and human. Best part - unlike Ghostbusters its not at the cost of making men seem like duntzes and unlike star wars she's not a Mary sue. Which is probably why critics arent as gung-ho for it. Their bad, though; I think its great to see a woman being the strongest character on the screen amongst strong men and a positive father figure.On top of that its a lot of fun - some major pacing issues which can make it seem slow. But still, I enjoyed it; makes me want to play the new games again."
"701",5,"  I loved the concept of this movie, the movie is exactly like the video game and Alicia Vikander was so bad a**. It was so welly written and so I'll give this 5 out of 5."
"702",1,"  Millions of $ for Special Effects with a nickel plot line."
"703",1.5,"  How can you shoot a movie that is based on a game title and manage to mess up the amazing storyline that's already there for you? People, if you want to see the actual story just play the 2013 Tomb Raider title. Kudos to Vikander though for portraying a version of Lara Croft that's almost identical to the one found in the new Tomb Raider games."
"704",5,"  Really loved this movie.. based on the 2013 tomb raider game. It has a lot of easter eggs to the game, the plot was interesting and kept me entertain around the hole movie. I really hope we get a sequel"
"705",5,"  They deliver what lara croft fans wanted and even non video game fans can also enjoy the movie for its worth to watch"
"706",5,"  Absolutely loved it. I'm a Tomb Rider fan, and I was nervous after watching the promos, that they were going to ruin it, but I went because I'm a fan. Well, I was not disappointed. Alicia Vikander brought the spunk, grit, and down right stubbornness you would expect from a young Lara Croft. Most of all, the casting choices were well made. The action and fight scenes felt real to me (save for one crazy ""tomb raider"" jump near the end. I was very pleased with this movie... I'll buy it and watch it again."
"707",5,"  Great Movie. Action packed fun with a great story."
"708",3.5,"  I really liked this movie, Vikander is a great choice for the new Laura Croft. I'm taking a star off for some lame writing, but the movie's fast pace and edge-of-seat tension blows past any rough patches. I loved the 2013 game and thought this movie matched that tone, so I imagine most folks that like the game will enjoy this movie. More to the point, my wife has never played any video games, but enjoyed this action adventure movie a lot as well."
"709",4.5,"  Great movie. Not as campy as the Jolie films. Much more gritty and realistic. I love the scenes taken from the game reboots. And I was so excited to see the Nick Frost cameos. I should have known he might be in it and I'm guessing he will have a bigger role in the sequels. Thank you Alicia Vikander. You are wonderful."
"710",3.5,"  Video game movies have had an increasingly bad rep since cinematic flopslike Warcraft and Assassin's Creed. While many people expected Tomb Raider to fall into a similar trap, I don't believe it does. Aside from having a boringish start in my opinion, after the island comes into play the story picks up signficantly with expensive action sequences and everything you would want Lara Croft to do. While it was not near perfect, it sets up a TombRaider franchise starring Alicia Vikander in the future, defeating her enemies.This not only will be very interesting as she grows more as an actress in thatcharacter, but also becomes more badass as the protagonist with a newattitude and weapons behind her portrayal. This was fun, and I am excitedto see where it goes. I am most excited however, due to the idea of a battlebetween the Uncharted film franchise and the Tomb Raider franchise. From avideogame perspective these have been compared for years, but with Sonyramping up to develop a Tom Holland-led feature film, I think the rivalry between the two could bring out the best in each other."
"711",5,"  BEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE EVER!!!!!"
"712",5,"  It's *P.E.R.F.E.C.T* Critics can go to hell. Only your own opinion is important, and as a fan, I was spoiled as hell with this movie. Loved the movie, love this new Lara."
"713",5,"  finally a good adaptation of video game! Alicia is amazing as Lara Croft"
"714",5,"  was really good, best video game movie thus far."
"715",5,"  Tomb Raider has plenty of thrilling action and great performances, of course, Alicia Vikander is the star. Also shout out to people who created the sets (the tomb!)."
"716",4,"  I could also trade alicia for the one that portrayed her in the game. She was really good! and the story took a different take from the game. It was a fun movie!"
"717",5,"  Liked this version more compared to Angelina Tomb Raider."
"718",2.5,"  TOMB RAIDER feels more like the studio had to make the movie as a chore as opposed to wanted to make it and make it brilliant. The potential for TOMB RAIDER movies are as abundant and thrilling as Star Wars movies yet mediocrity appears to be the modus operandi on making game movies. It's a fun, no brainer movie that is heavily predictable and will be completely forgotten until the sequel. If they ever make one that is.Full review is now up on Salty Popcorn."
"719",5,"  Loved it. Great movie to eat some popcorn and have a good time. Alicia Vikander was fabulous as Lara Croft."
"720",0.5,"  Almost fell asleep a couple times watching it. Wait till it comes out on Netflix. Don't waste your money on this one"
"721",4,"  Critics are being ridiculous. This was fierce, gritty, emotional, modern, tense and fun as hell."
"722",5,"  Vikander's Lara Croft is the perfect blend of ass kicking action hero and relatable ""cool girl"". Her performance transcends the tangible lack of supporting character development and carries the film to a soaring, emotional, and heart pounding finale. Roar Uthaug's ""Tomb Raider"" is sure to be remembered as the first great video game anyone has ever seen."
"723",1,"  Very boring up to 2/3rd of the movie, after that it's super predictable. Vikander is not believable as Lara Croft, it was clearly the wrong casting choice for a new franchise. Oh well, let's wait 10 years forthe next reboot."
"724",5,"  Amazing movie. Has a lot of action and just the right amount of suspense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more!"
"725",5,"  . I have just returned from watching the action-packed reboot of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise with Swedish actress Alicia Vikander in the title role and she is so extraordinary I was literally in awe of her for its almost two-hour runtime. Pre-publicity suggested that Lara Croft had been re-imagined, doing away with the sexy portrayal that the aforementioned Jolie had turned in, but I would claim that Vikander's brand of powerful athleticism is incredibly sexy. Sure, she's not shown in the tight-fitting outfits that Jolie pranced around her two movies in, but Vikander doesn't need them to be stunning, she has a poise and a grace that Jolie could never muster and when she turns on the heat the screen sizzles.The plot for what it is worth, concerns Vikander's Lara Croft seeking answers to the disappearance of her father several years earlier. He had ventured to an uncharted uninhabited island off Japan in the center of a particularly vicious sea in search of the tomb of a legendary Queen of Death. It seems a criminal organization known as Trinity is also hunting for the tomb and very soon Lara is off running through the desert, escaping certain death in several fist-clenching moments. I held my breath several times, feeling the director ratchet up the tension as I tried to figure out how Lara would survive the predicament. I had heard from earlier reviews that the movie had slow spots in it and I have to wonder if that reviewer saw the same movie as I. For shortly after a 'chase the fox' bicycle race in the streets of London and Lara is in Hong Kong racing after a trio of thieves before taking to the high seas in a raging storm. Full credit goes to Vikander who not only takes the action in her stride but is also able to pull off a very believable British accent. She balances the earnestness of her character's search with measured humor and humanity to bring dimension to a character that (since the origin is a popular video game) could have been wafer-thin. My favorite scene could quite possibly be a sequence that finds Lara hanging onto an old plane wing above a raging waterfall. Vikander is ably supported in her role by British actors Dominic West and Kristin Scott Thomas as Lara's missing father and her guardian respectively. Scott Thomas appears very briefly at the beginning and the end, though it is suggested she could have a larger role in any subsequent sequel. The villain of the piece is a suitably diabolical character named Mathias Vogel, a Trinity man-on-the-ground played with relish by Walton Goggins. Much of the humor is provided by sea captain Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu and his ""drunken sailor"" quip got a chuckle from the audience I saw the movie with.It's a foregone conclusion that I will want to see this movie again and again and I am hoping it gets a sequel because I can't wait to see Vikanders brand of action heroine in more fare. This movie comes highly recommended."
"726",4.5,"  So got done watching the new Tomb Raider...Got to see pretty impressed with the film..Did this film brake the video game movie curse... Yes it very much did,Everyones performance was great but the stand out was Alicia Vikander as Lara croft her performance was like the character jump straight from The game.The film works as not only a tomb Raider film but if you take off the name of Tomb Raider and you are left with a great action adventure film.If you are a fan of the 2013 reboot series then you will enjoy this film.. Taking most of the iconic elements from that game and using them in a convincing way that not only serves the narrative but delivers a nice node to fans of the game8/10"
"727",5,"  One of the few good video game movies. It isn't really anything special per se, but it's a veeery enjoyable movie. I love Alicia as Lara, she truly feels like reboot lara, amd yet she beings her own things to the table. If you like action movies or the game reboot, go watch this."
"728",5,"  As realistic as a fantasy action movie can be, Alicia brings ethos, fun, action, adventure and character to Lara Croft in this prequel that some critics are mistakenly thinking is a remake. Take your pre- and teen grand/daughters! (just two bad words)"
"729",4,"  I loved this film. If you can go see it at a Cineworld where it's showing in 4D I really would! Love that they've left it open for a sequel! A"
"730",3,"  I'm sorry but the trailer looked terrible. Bad CGI,shaky cam and I can't see Alicia as Lara (I'm a big fan of the game reboot and its sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider). For me, Angelina Jolie will always be Lara Croft."
"731",4,"  A very rare good video game movie. Solid action, almost to the level of an Indiana Jones movie. Alicia Vikander does a fantastic job as Lara, wouldn't have chosen anyone else. Walter Goggins villian character is a paint-by-numbers villian, not much else to say about him. While not the most compelling story, I did enjoy where it took me and how everything tied together in the end. Hopefully they continue this franchise and give us some more stories with this character."
"732",2.5,"  I'm not going to lie, the film seriously has rhythm problems, mainly in the development, and also is overshadowed by special effects of low quality, but it is certainly a breakthrough in videogame-based movies, locations, emotions and above all, Vikander, they raise this movie with great difficulty, which in my opinion could have been much worse, but in the same way, it could have been much better, let's hope that the predictable sequels are better."
"733",1,"  it was like Hunger games, Indiana Jones and the last Crusade, and The Goonies had a weird three way and produced a wimpy Lara Croft children's story."
"734",4,"  A wonderful origin story. Some of the scenes were pretty intense."
"735",3,"  Alicia Vikander does a fine job of being an action hero. The action was good. The story line is very uninspired. We have see the tomb scenes done as well. At least with Indiana Jones they were fresh. Would probably watch a second but will not be sad it there is not another."
"736",2.5,"  ***D-Box Review for Tomb Raider*** (DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON D-BOX!!!!!!!!) Must of been our night to hang out in Union Landing because everywhere we went was a bundle of joy...:-/ We have been to this theatre a ton of times and have spent a lot of money...my wife and I tried D-Box for the first time when Black Panther came out and enjoyed it. My wife even bought more tickets to take our nephew to enjoy the experience. My wife was hooked and bought it for Tomb Raider....it sucked...I forgot that we had even purchased D-Box for the seats because it only really worked 2 times throughout the movie...we paid that much for what? Should of called it D-Box-Sucks. We ended up getting someone to ask about this experience. Xavier the Assistant manager said the experience is on each individual and it may differ depending on the person..blah blah blah....we paid for a rocking chair...Xavier then went to speak with the Senior Manager Mike E. and he said there is nothing they can do for us...basically we got robbed....I asked how come there isn't some type of disclosure or anything staying how intense or whack the experience will be for that movie. Now that I'm done with this, time to contact corporate because although the movie was entertaining, we got robbed for D-Crap-Box...Xavier had advised me he doesn't buy D-Box-Sucks tickets...I wonder why...I wish I would of known that before we wasted our money on a squeaky chair."
"737",4,"  The movie is an overall great action flick. Those looking for deeper meaning may be a little underwhelmed. The game did a lot better job showing her development from innocent empowered woman to legendary badass, but the movie obviously had to cut down on some things. With all that said, it was an enjoyable movie and I would be opposed to seeing a sequel."
"738",2.5,"  It was a pretty good watch. It was kind of predictable. I could have waited until it came on HBO."
"739",3.5,"  'Tomb Raider' is one of better video game film adaptations to come to screen, all thanks to its fast paced action, simple premise and a stunning lead in Alicia Vikander."
"740",4,"  Movie goes very fast"
"741",1,"  Seemed like they tried to make a live action video game. Didn't like the character portrayal AT ALL! All that screechy screaming, she even says shit and mouths 'fuck' Her father seemed sooo pathetic. Lara's supposed to be deliberate and sultry, but she's running, running, running getting the crap beat out of her. The story is sooo lame. Hated it"
"742",3.5,"  This was a better Indiana Jones movie than the actual last Indiana Jones movie. It was not as good as Raiders of course but still I was pleasantly surprised."
"743",4.5,"  Genuinely fun action romp, had a great time watching."
"744",5,"  Loved this movie. As did my 11 year old daughter. Alicia is superb."
"745",2.5,"  This film is better than the original Angelina Jolie ones,,, thats partly because Alicia Vikander is a more believable performer and is allowed to be more human and vulnerable than Jolie was... but also the storyline is slightly more grounded... It's not a great movie but its entertaining and thats whats important."
"746",4,"  Is a fresh face for the Tomb Raider and it was good departure from the ways it was done when Angelina Jolie was at the helm of the character , and honestly is was a impressive movie that had mix of a 007 movie with tidbits of mission impossible and Indiana Jones films , and hopefully we can get a sequel to expand on the character with a new actress"
"747",4,"  Tomb Raider's star Alicia Vikander goes all in, and is helped by a story that is surprisingly, almost as agile as she is. There is no glitz or glam here to elevate the film, and the audience can decide for themselves if that is a good thing or a bad thing. What Tomb Raider is sure to do is satisfy the masses with a blockbuster that for once has a story and protagonist that feel fully real and realized. The movie sports an admirable and diverse supporting cast, but they just can't compete with the star's incredible lead performance, not that they don't give it a nice try."
"748",5,"  Absolutely fantastic film. Enjoyed this alot more than the yawn fest that was black panther. What are critics on these days."
"749",5,"  This critic score is another example of why audiences shouldn't trust critics anymore. They gave their endorsement to Last Jedi, which was pretty terrible, and then they slap a 50% on this film, which in my opinion was very good. The action was great, the plot was enthralling, and there was nothing glaringly wrong with the movie. Really don't know why the critics were so upset by it. Highly recommend!"
"750",5,"  I enjoyed the film a lot! Filled with fun, edge-of-your-seat action scenes, an interesting and fresh take on Lara. Alicia killed it, she's always a delight to watch on screen and have this magnetism about her, you can't take your eyes of her!"
"751",4.5,"  Great reboot of the franchise! Following the star power of Jolie is tough enough, but Vikander's adaptation of the role as a young beginner is ""sooper"". She invested time, effort, acting on this movie and it showed! We love the cliff hangers, more natural. We like the plot, and that it took pieces from the game with more natural EFX!... nothing relevant here, but I felt watching this the second time - a feeling I didn't get from Star Wars The Last Jedi. That SW TLJ movie was dumb. This LC Tomb Raider by Vikander ROCKS!!! Kudos to the director for getting this right!"
"752",3.5,"  Tomb Raider is an enjoyable rebooted movie with some good adventure/action moments. There are lot of deja-vus and for me one the main one was Indiana Jones raiders of the lost ark. The special effects are sometimes good and sometimes ok. Overall fun!"
"753",5,"  It is an impressing movie with the stunning performance of Vikander. It is the best movie in March."
"754",5,"  Loved it! Had so much fun watching this movie and would highly recommend!"
"755",5,"  The movie is actually decent, respect source material from video games, adding some plot twist that somehow managed better than the video games. Although, lacking of the ruins, myth or the feeling of ""Japan"" of Yamatai Island, and some confusing plots. The whole film is really well done with solid acting, solid action sequences, nice puzzles and the final tomb is good. I really love it. Great movie, great video game adaptation."
"756",2,"  Bland and boring. Very poor ending with no real excitement"
"757",0.5,"  Stop trying to make sprout happen....lame"
"758",5,"  it was fantastic, i loved it, felt like I played a whole video game in a two hour slot,and lots of challenges from the first games in there. I loved how the movie didn't directly jump into the wild, starts off with life in London, and very happy with the fox race. It gives it more as a film. Very impressed with how they did it, think it'll open up the franchise to people who have never played it before too, just a great stand alone film, but also good for existing fans. very happy"
"759",3.5,"  Lara croft being one of the most famous women adventurers in gaming, highly sexualised with an urealistic body image for some men to drool over, and video game films flopping over the years with awful scripts and terrible likeness of the characters. The new 2018 Tomb Raider film was an absolute fun mix of plot, character development, action, adventure, puzzle solving and quite an intimidating villain which I had my doubts about but he actually pulled it off really well and made me feel quite uncomfortable as he was really menacing, especially how villains in a lot of films these days are quite forgettable and not worth mentioning. The most important part is Alicia as Lara croft, she owned the role particularly well, she's a young, fit and tough woman who showed a badass but humanised and grounded Lara croft and held her own until the very end of the film. The story was well written and held closely to the 2013 game reboot story and cinematography with changes here and there, but it was the Lara croft of the 1990s and that's all that matters as it's sticking to source material. If you're in this film for tits and ass, go home and rethink your life because this film is for intellectuals who can think with their upstairs brain. SEQUEL PLEASE!"
"760",4.5,"  A massive leap from the Angelina Jolie era of Tomb Raider, it is a must see movie regardless of reviews, this will satisfy gamers."
"761",3.5,"  This movie is definitely an big improvement in the video game genre. It stayed as true as possible to the game it was based on. Alicia Vikander is for sure the stand out in this movie. And brings you a female badass, that has also a lot more humanity and depth to her then the previous Lara. She nails that role and I couldn't get enough of her. The Action and the CGI was fine too. The only big thing the movie was lacking is an inspiring and original story. It felt a little worn out. But all in all a big step in the right direction and a really enjoyable time at the theater."
"762",4,"  Needed a less generic paint by the picture story and villain. Great effects, action sequences and a brutal effort by Alicia Vikander. Very true to the rebooted tomb raider games, and maybe a it too faithful."
"763",5,"  Loved the games and loved the movie. Great action, drama, touch of comedy. Felt like a realistic adaptation. You don't have to have played the game and enjoy it."
"764",4.5,"  Yay! I really liked it!Casting for the movie was perfect, Walton Goggins makes for the perfect villain. Alicia Vikander made a perfect Lara. Storyline was slightly different ( but a few on par stuff) from the game but not surprised as they have to cram a lot of storyline in a 2 hours movie. The end did set it up for way more storyline in future movies, so I'm stoked to see where it goes.Fantastic job on graphics, scenery and props matching the game.Really fun and worth seeing."
"765",5,"  Walmart:Screen protectorPaintbrushesBlack, gold, white, and purple paintMaple bacon seasoningDr. PepperAldi/Kroger:PizzaCoffee creamerLg Ziplock bagsBreadChickenDish SoapChipsMayoSpongesPepperBell pepperLettuceEggsKleenexI was highly skeptical going into this movie, but it performed so above and beyond what I had imagined. Gone is the over-sexualized Laura Croft of Jolie's run. Alicia Vikander is perfect. While she's beautiful, she proves that female action stars don't need to be oversexualized to be entertaining.As a fan of the video games, I was so pleased. The movie was written tightly, and Vikander shines as Laura. It's a treat that we see her develop over the course of the movie into the Tomb Raider, rather than crash onto the scene as such. I'm excited to see where the movie franchise goes. My only critiques are that I wish the tombs had been a little more detailed, and there needed to be more supernatural elements surrounding the tombs. I won't say more on the last, as spoilers would surely follow. All in all, a great franchise reboot."
"766",5,"  amazing. best adaptation of game ever made"
"767",1.5,"  all myths are foundations of reality..Tomb RaiderEven though there are stunning graphic visuals (all the water based sequences are beautifully shot), goosefleshing sound effects, brutal action sequences and jaw dropping stunts (hats off to the stuntmen) ironically the choreography; in a feature like this that relies a lot upon such stuff, is petty and questionable which at a certain point turns depressing rather than frustrating. At this stage of cinema, one would assume that the remake or the updated version of any feature or tale would be created with an aim to surpass the predecessor and fulfill the limitations (one is wrong). The premise never had enough potential to bedazzle the audience in the first place but in here the director Roar Uthaug is not even convincing the audience for a second look. Alicia Vikander, at the heart of it is so good and genuine throughout the course of it that it aches you to watch a talent go waste by. Tomb Raider has a shallow script that lacks gripping screenplay, better execution and editing (it ticks for around 2 hours which is way too much considering the material offered to the audience) to hold the audience on any loose thread of it."
"768",4,"  A fresh and welcomed return of Lara Croft to the big screen. The previous Tomb Raider/Lara Croft films seemed disjointed and slightly cartoonish. This time around, I believe we get a holistic look at who Lara Croft is and what drives her on.There is the occasional ?hiccup?, such as a nine year old tape recorder that plays without changing the batteries, but hey who carries spare batteries with them.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the revamped Tomb Raider. This film put meat on the bones of a franchise previously starved for ideas and has breathed life into the whole console game v?s big screen adaptation.Just wish someone somewhere would consider having a crack at the ?Uncharted? franchise. Seeing Nathan Drake on the big screen would be cool.Anyway, can?t wait to see the next instalment of Tomb Raider Mk 2"
"769",4,"  This is a really good movie. It sets up Lara Croft, beautifully crafts her as a normal day girl, Alicia Vikander only adds up to this beloved character, making her even more interesting and loveable. The action scenes are well put together, and different to what we are used to seeing in big screen spectacles, the action in this movie feels soulfull, with a heart pumping, they're powefull but then again simple. We can tell the C.G.I is there, but the built sets and the simplicity of the crafting of the action scenes take over any flaws. The father and daughter moments are touching and believable, it flows the story forward. I wish this movie had a better rating from critics, it truly makes me start thinking that it is purely prejudice against video game movies, as they all seem to bring the subject up, rather then just looking at the movie for what it is. A well acted, beautifully crafted and plotted action adventure, coming of age small flick, where not everything is perfect and shiny, but Alicia Vikander shines so bright like a diamond. Go see it...it's worth it."
"770",5,"  Great film version of Tomb Raider. Alicia rocks as Lara Croft, and I would really like to see part 2! I hope this would become a start of a great franchise."
"771",1,"  Being an enthusiastic fan of the Tomb Raider games, a movie that looked like it was pulled straight out of my favorite of the games had me nearly vibrating in anticipation. The trailers and teasers used scenes carefully chosen to mimic iconic 2013 Tomb Raider game moments, bursting with promises of an incredible live action debut of the fantastically written reboot of Lara Croft's story. The resulting movie, however, proved nothing more than a vast disappointment and a waste of two hours that would have served better in the game it was pretending to emulate."
"772",5,"  Amazing performance by Alicia i love the movie she is young Lara and not that powerful but smart and brave.Full with action and good story for a first movie i will watch it again"
"773",5,"  Definitelty recommanded! Alicia simply kills it as Lara Croft! Hope for a sequel!"
"774",5,"  Awesome Reboot! Loved it!"
"775",4,"  Much better than the previous films and quite enjoyable"
"776",5,"  Alicia Vikander delivered an emotional and convincing performance, paired with accurate and nostalgic action sequences, this movie is a must see, especially for any true Tomb Raider fan."
"777",5,"  That was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed that, especially after the disappointments that were the first two movie. This one makes the originals look like some cheap high school production.Alicia was PERFECT, everything that Jolie wasn't. Nice to see an actual fit and athletic looking Lara Croft, AND one that can actually throw a punch and kick without making you cringe at the terrible technique.Loved this movie, can't wait to see it again.Alicia Vikander IS Lara Croft."
"778",1.5,"  Oooof. With such an enormous budget, what happened?! The importance of story telling has never been more important in a film!Where do we start? A storyline that's a mess, a rediculous plot, unrealized characters, uninteresting dialogue, colorless cinematic pallet, extremely slow paced, and... wait for it... underdeveloped action scenes, tension building and weak performances. Yes, even award winning actors deliver stiff performances and lack the chemistry needed to make this tolerable to watch. Forgivable for a 10M film. Not 90M."
"779",4.5,"  WOW! This wasn't just a great video game film, it was a great action flick! Once you get past the bike chase scene the film takes off! Disappointed in the film industry to only score it 50% on here!"
"780",4,"  TOMB RAIDER entertains excellently through Alicia Vikander's powerful performance and fast, groundbreaking action in intricate, attentive depictions of the ocean and island even if the movie hardly has any plot written out and behaves very much like a live-action video game played out for you."
"781",3.5,"  In 2013 square Enix did something smart -They realized the world is more aware and less naive, and realized a new version of Tomb Raider, a little more realistic and mature where the main character is brave but vernabl. A great original story.The movie creators made the same smart decision, following thia path and it pays off.The casting is the best achievement while Alicia is nothing less than fantastic and the story is intriguing, with solid action sequences.There are a few plot holes that prevent this picture beefing something really great, but still, its a fun ride to join."
"782",3.5,"  Highly entertaining, action packed take on the Tomb Raider franchise. The actress playing the titular character did very well in the face of a fairly weak plot. That said, there have been FAR WORSE examples of films based on video games just in this franchise, let alone the whole video game movie genre. I ponied up for shake seats in the movie theater for this one and it did not disappoint. Brava, Lara Croft. 3.5 out of 5"
"783",3.5,"  I think if you go into this reboot of ""Tomb Raider"" knowing what you're getting yourself into, it can be an entertaining time. The story feels pretty simple and the character development feels rushed but this is probably because this is a two-hour movie inspired by a much longer game. I have thoroughly enjoyed the newest entries in the ""Tomb Raider"" games and it is clear this movie was trying to emulate the style and feel of them. I think when compared to at least the first Angelina Jolie entry, this movie is a bit better, as it is less cheesy, and better acted. Alicia Vikander fits well in the role and is a compelling Lara Croft. This movie is a solid video game adaptation simply meant to entertain. It delivers fast-paced†action scenes that definitely feel like you're watching a game and is admittedly pretty enjoyable. It's not the definitive video game adaptation by any means, but it feels like a step in the right direction for the genre."
"784",2,"  You would enjoy Tomb Raider more if you lower your expectations and bring a controller. Every scene with Lara feels like a quick time event. Vikander was okay but the movie lacks a good story."
"785",4,"  Ok, I was really impressed how the kept true the overall tomb raider games (roboot series). During the a lot action scenes, I was screaming in my head ""push x!"" or ""oh shit, left trigger, right trigger!"" As far as the story, I wouldn't say it pulled my heart strings or saw anything unexpected but good overall. If your a fan of the series or looking for a good action movie, this is a good one."
"786",5,"  I loved it good story and good acting can't wait till number 2"
"787",5,"  I love this movie definitely BEST Tomb Raider movie. It is also my favorite video game movie ever!!!"
"788",5,"  I loved it! Absolutely phenomenal! Alicia Vikander kills as the new Lara Croft! This movie totally captures the essence of the new Tomb Raider games as well as nods to the classics! I can't wait to see it again!"
"789",4.5,"  This is easily the best movie adaptation of a video game in recent years. Lots of good action and a solid story. It doesn't follow the 2013 story because that would require a lot of bad CGI, but it does have some of the iconic moments. This is a fresh and original reboot that's worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of the franchise."
"790",5,"  Lara remains the bad ass she always has been. Just like the reboots of the games, it just has better graphics than the previous ones made. She seems less of a super here (compared to Angelina) to more of an extremely fit everday girl who has bravery and wits like no other. Loved it. Bring me more!"
"791",1,"  Way below my expectation"
"792",4.5,"  I really like it,is a really good adventure movie and Alicia Vikander NAILED IT as Lara Croft"
"793",5,"  Disregard the TOMATOMETER, in this instance the audience score is far more telling. I've seen Tomb Raider several times now and I enjoy it more each time I see it. While it's not a perfect movie it is compelling and interesting. I think it's a shame that Rotten Tomatoes might discourage people from seeing this in theaters because it was truly a delight. If you are a fan of the games, you'll appreciate it all the better. But the beauty of this film is that you don't have to be a fan of the games to enjoy it. It stays true to the source material but doesn't forget that it's a movie and not a game, a mistake that many other adaptations have made in the past. I gave this movie 5 stars not because it was perfect but because it was enjoyable. And I think you'll enjoy it too if you get past the the TOMATOMETER and just experience it for yourself in theaters."
"794",5,"  Enjoyed the movie far more than a 50% rating. Won't win an Oscar, but very entertaining. The only annoyance was the constant screaming. I am a Tomb Raider video game fan and she seemed whiny compared to Lara in the games. However, well worth seeing."
"795",5,"  Love the action. It doesn't let up.. Great adventure a few good discoveries. What a great throw back to Indiana Jones!! What a ride."
"796",4,"  From the preview I expected it to be exactly like the game it's based on. Turns out it's VERY loosely based on the game, and I mean very. That being said, it was still enjoyable and fun. I'll see the sequel if they make one for sure."
"797",5,"  No shortage of action and great story telling in this big screen adaptation of the video game series Tomb Raider"
"798",4,"  Intense action/adventure film. Fan of Tomb Raider (the game) or not. It is amazingly entertaining."
"799",5,"  I like this Tomb Raider reboot. The main character is much more likable then Angelina. Not sure why Critics are giving it bad reviews."
"800",4,"  I enjoyed it quite a bit! As a fan of the video games, especially the most recent Rise of the Tomb Raider, I enjoyed Vikander's performance. I feel like she captured the grittiness of Lara Croft's character."
"801",1,"  Spoiler Alert-this is poorly written. Laura Croft is supposed to be Smart and Athletic. They got this 1/2 right. She repeatedly makes dumb mistakes and is mentally weak! 4X she has the Villain Dead-to-rights and does NOTHING! She doesn't kill him when given the opportunity NUMEROUS times. She walks through his tent without him seeing her and she has a weapon. What does she do? Decides to go out looking for her buddy. WTH? She has an opportunity to push him over a cliff, into a cravats, off a platform, and shot him in the face. Does nothing...She leads the villain where he wants. Does what he wants. Seems to be more FOR him than against.Causes more problems and is down right foolish. This was excruciating to watch! Glad I didn't pay to see the 3D. It's a rental flick at best."
"802",3.5,"  Great fun, much like the last two games. Lara Croft and Alicia Vikander are badass! Can't wait for the next one, make it bigger and better please. This was a great start."
"803",2.5,"  Good movie if you have never played the games."
"804",5,"  Good movie' nice history"
"805",5,"  I just saw it and enjoyed it a lot. A bit too fast but still enjoyable."
"806",5,"  An action packed film, a plot worthy of the new Tomb Raider video games, Alicia captures the essence of Lara that we all know; a brave woman, intelligent but at the same time more human capable of making mistakes Definitely a film that no fan of Lara should miss!"
"807",4,"  I think this may be the best video game based movie that has come out in a while. It actually feels very much like Tomb Raider and Alicia vikander I feel portrays Lara Croft very well. I do feel that there were some opportunities missed and making her character a bit more well-rounded but overall I thought this was a very good movie. And it looks like the story going forward will be very exciting."
"808",4,"  Tomb Raider was an enjoyable action movie with good effects and an interesting plot. Its dialogue was one of its only weaknesses, feeling slightly forced. Lara was grounded and relatable, however, almost every one of her decisions were reckless and stupid despite everyone telling her how smart she was. Overall, it was a good movie with mostly admirable qualities."
"809",4.5,"  Being a fan of the game franchise it whisks you into the adventurous world of Laura Croft in the best way possible. The original adaptation was much more hollywood block buster while this feels like a simple ""indiana jones"" ish move. Much more grounded and although the world itself has to have unrealistic elements stays grounded in reality with the protagonist often getting hurt , disoriented, and tired. it knows what it is in terms of plot its simple but driven by the performance of Alicia Vikander. The villain kind of fell short in terms of depth but he still remained the dark part of the movie. Great fan service at the end, strong leading lady , and generally a fun movie."
"810",3,"  Unnecessary, pointless, predictable and boring ... Alicia Vikander was great but this was rinse and repeat of the previous films ... not necessary a bad film but can't beat Indiana Jones ..."
"811",3.5,"  i WILL GO AS FAR TO SAY THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. NOT A GREAT MOVIE, BUT IT'S GOOD. ENJOYABLE TO SAY THE LEAST. i WILL ALSO SAY THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ANGELINA JOLIE VERSIONS, AND WHILE THIS MOVIE HAS SOME FLAWS, THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO THOSE. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY FEELS MORE LIKE THEY WANTED TO BUILD OFF THE TOMB RAIDER (2013) REMAKE OF THE GAMES, AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. IT HAD PLENTY OF ACTION, IT WAS FAST PACED (ALBEIT A BIT TOO FAST, BUT THAT'S REALLY JUST ME NITPICKING ON IT. SOME THINGS GO FAST BUT IF IT EXPLAINED MORE IT WOULD JUST ADD MORE TO THE OVERALL LENGTH OF THE FILM.)THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE IS VERY GENERIC. ALMOST LIKE THEY JUST DIDN'T TRY. FATHER GOES AWAY, SAYS HE WILL COME BACK, DOESN'T. DAUGHTER FOLLOWING IN THE ""FAMILY FOOTSTEPS"" SETS OFF TO FIND HIM. THEN STORY GOES FROM THERE. I DID LIKE THE ENDING THOUGH, LEFT OFF FOR A SEQUEL AND HAS A NICE TWIST. I DO LOVE ALICIA VIKANDER AS LARA CROFT. SHE PLAYS IT BEAUTIFULLY AND IS THE SAVING GRACE. HER CHARACTER WAS WELL DONE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HER CONTINUE THE ROLE.ALL IN ALL IT'S A SOLID MOVIE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO SEE IT, BUT FROM REDBOX OR USING A MOVIEPASS."
"812",5,"  Probably the best video game film adaptation yet !! It is very faithful to the rebooted game with adding some of its own twists to it so its not exactly like the game. I've read critic reviews and I believe that they are misinterpreting the new Lara Croft, mostly because Lara is desexualized and is made more grounded. Regardless great movie with great pace, character development, emotional attachments, and great action seauences. Highly recommended."
"813",4.5,"  An excellent piece of entertainment! I really enjoyed this remake. It's fast-paced, great action sequences, and Alicia Vikander, who plays Lara Croft, is outstanding. Vikander is one of my favourite actors and she brings a believability to her performance and makes the story more grounded than the originals. Norwegian Roar Uthaug direction is spot on. I've taken 1/2 a star off for the inevitable plot holes. But who really cares when it's such a joy to watch. Check it out on the big screen. Can't wait for the next one."
"814",5,"  Fantastic Tomb Raider reboot that has Alicia as Lara Croft. She's beautiful and is a great actress. Plenty of action and entertaining."
"815",4,"  classic studio film but Alicia as craft is awesome and it was an enjoyable time!"
"816",3.5,"  The most famous boobs...er...character...in modern gaming history is back! And this time, they're...er...SHE'S...a bit more realistic!TOMB RAIDER (2018)I never actually played the games. I only know of the Lara Croft character through others & the media, so I only know the basics: she's pretty much just Indiana Jones (with boobs!!), her backstory pretty much involves her search for her father, & that's pretty much it (& she has really big boobs!!). When they came out with a couple of Tomb Raider films in the early 2000s, starring Angelina Jolie, I enjoyed them, although they weren't in anyway realistic....the plots of the films, I mean! (yes, this is the review with all the boob jokes). Now we have a totally new Tomb Raider, with far more natural & realistic....plot elements, & actress Alicia Vikander as the...ahem...titular character. Will she stack up...or fall flat? (last boob joke, I swear!!)In short, this reboot-prequel was pretty darn good. At two hours, it was a bit long, but none of that time really felt wasted, the story flowed pretty steadily, & it didn't feel like they were playing shuffle in the editing room.Now, on to our new Lara. Alicia Vikander is playing a Lara Croft at the very beginning of her adventures, she has some skills, but she's totally untested, & when she gets in over her head, you can tell she's unsure of her own survival; you can see when she's afraid, & that that's not gonna stop her. Vikander plays the role very organically; if this were a prequel to the original films, I could believe Vikander & Jolie were playing the same Lara at different points in her life.The villain straddled the line between clichÈ video game bad guy, & decent well rounded character. We got a bit of his backstory, not sure if he was telling the truth or not though, but when I looked into his eyes, he seemed...somewhat tortured by his duties, like he knew he was in the wrong, but his employers had him on a short leash, so he had to turn off his humanity to keep working. I found him somewhat sympathetic, the actor playing him did an ok job IMHO.The background characters all added to the story nicely without bogging things down in needless exposition. All in all, the cast was pretty darn good all around.The effects were mostly practical, the adventure elements of the games grounded in reality, which made for a much more believable story. I felt like I was on the adventure, not just playing a game, which made for a more enjoyable experience.I did figure out the secret of the tomb in question pretty early, & I think most folks will, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the story's twists & turns, leading to a decent climax, & a bit of obvious sequel baiting, which I hope will lead to at least a 2nd movie.Tomb Raider (2018) overall was a decent reboot-prequel, it respected the franchise, & it made the main character into something more than just eye candy. I'm giving it 3.5 stars outta 5. Let's hope this new Lara Croft inspires the current generation the way Indiana Jones has in the past."
"817",3.5,"  A good movie. Not bad, not great, but definitely enjoyable to watch."
"818",3,"  La pel√≠cula de Tomb Raider (2018) no ten√≠a mucho de tombs ni de raiders, pero a√∫n as√≠ no fue un desastre. Fue disfrutable a pesar de no ser la gran cosa. Square Enix te odio. En fin, la pel√≠cula no creo que aburra a muchos, tiene acci√≥n, la Lara Crof est√° bastante decente, momentos entretenidos y algunos easter egg de los juegos que se disfrutan si eres fan de la saga (principalmente los dos √∫ltimos t√≠tulos). No creo que se le pueda pedir mucho m√°s a una pel√≠cula de este estilo.Mi parte favorita fue el cameo de Nick Frost porque Nick es amor ?. Eso s√≠, probablemente la mejor adaptaci√≥n de pel√≠cula a un videojuego, pero es re f√°cil, porque en general son todas basura.Tanto el juego Tomb Raider (2013) y el Rise of the Tomb Raider son superiores en todo aspecto. (JUEGAZOS ??)3/5."
"819",0.5,"  A miserable parody of the Tomb Raider. Vikander is no Lara even a little. Don't waste your money for this piece of crap."
"820",4.5,"  Sometimes you can't trust movie critics. I feel the movie was very well done. Alicia Vikander was an excellent Lara Croft, giving even Angelina Jolie a run for a money. It was highly entertaining and kept my interest throughout. People complained about the lackluster origin story and true, it could have really been expanded and built upon,but overall the movie was great. I highly recommend it."
"821",5,"  I like it and i will buy the blu ray and watch it again , Alicia is awesome in this role. A lot of action , good story and realy good performance , she is young and i love that she is not overpowered she fight and kill for the first time and she got hurt a lot too...... i hope for a trilogy :)"
"822",3.5,"  Tomb Raider has all the elements one wants from a good videogame movie:the action,the great visual effects,the referendes to the game but also a solid plot that entertains and makes you care about the main characters just enough to be invested in their action throughout the entire film. Alicia Vikander is just AWESOME and BADASS as Lara Croft and mamages to bring that emotional layer that Jolie's perfomance lacked. Showing Lara Croft as a tormented and unexperienced young woman, before she was the tomb raided everybody knows, was a smart move that made the audience create a stronger bond with her.All in all Tomb Raider is a very good movie and easily the best video game movie so far in my opinion. Hopefully this was just the first chapter of a long saga that may very well represent the long awaited rebirth of the videogame genre."
"823",5,"  Awesome movie! It kept you on the edge of your seat from Beginning to end! Alicia Vikander was an amazing Lara Croft and I loved the Character Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu."
"824",4,"  A lot of fun and if you've played the reboots you'll recognize moments from the game that'll make you smile. alicia vikander is a really awesome new lara. i absolutely loved her. if you're looking for another angelina jolie style lara this is not the movie for you. that's the lara for the original games, this is the lara for the reboot. both are great in different ways. it's not a perfect movie, but as a huge fan of the games, i really enjoyed it and i hope there's more down the road."
"825",5,"  Fantastic movie. Gritty and realistic with really cool action scenes. Vikander was perfect as Lara."
"826",4,"  alicia as lara croft was somewhat ok still perfer angelina jolie version"
"827",3,"  A grounded reboot, based on the 2013 video game. Though extremely generic, this is a fun action flick and a faithful adaption of the game. Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, she is wonderful in this role. She really does capture the attitude and heart of the video game character. She is so great in these action sequences, the fights and chases. Walton Goggins is an absolutely fantastic actor, but his character, this villain, is so generic and bland that any actor could have been plucked out for the role.This isn't a perfect film; the story at times and the dialogue can take you out of the film. There's an extremely unnecessary subplot with Daniel Wu's character, and the editing during the action sequences can be so jarring - 3 or 4 cuts per second. Today's age and what we see time and time again with certain directors, I can't help but be disappointed when blockbuster films such as this can't get the editing right. Some pretty good CGI though, and the video game aspects made me so happy, seeing them translated on screen with what today's technology can give us! The dungeon puzzles, the weapons, locations and battles - this film also includes a lot more violence and gore than I would have guessed."
"828",5,"  Amazing movie! It Shows Lara Croft before being ""Lara Croft"" but with her essence. This movie is about the new reboot of franchise (2013). Truly fans will love this movie."
"829",5,"  I am a huge fan of the 2013 Tomb Raider game and its sequel. So I was really looking forward to this incarnation of Lara Croft on the big screen. This movie did not disappoint. Don't go see it expecting Oscar caliber acting and writing! Go see for the love of the serial action genre and just fun action. I can't wait to see what else they do with this film in the future!"
"830",3,"  Tomb Raider brings Lara Croft back to the big-screen with a clearer understanding of its source material than the Angelina Jolie films and a flawed but relatively entertaining adventure movie to boot, it isn't perfect but close enough!"
"831",5,"  Just watched it and thought it was a great movie a bit slow to the start but really picked up and was true to the new video games. I hope to see a whole series spring from this movie."
"832",4.5,"  The movie looks a lot like the Game. I missed Angelina but this movie is more real."
"833",5,"  Excellent movie a very cool herione and not super powers just brains, tough, and dam good looking. Looking forward to the sequel since the armed her with her trademark guns at the end."
"834",3.5,"  Apart from feeling a little drawn out I enjoyed the movie and would say to anyone who is tossing up whether to go or not (maybe based on the critics) to go. It's got plenty of action and it's done well, I thought the villain was played nice and not over the top - I wouldn't have wanted to mess with him - and the support cast did a good job.Obvious sequel set up was a bit in your face - and if they don't make one will look dumb - but overall good entertaining movie."
"835",5,"  The poor rating that this movie got is seen all over Lora craft in the film. This movie was fantastic and she is such a strong woman as an actor and a character. But since it's no ""Black Panther"" rotten tomatoes gave it a low score. Typical... 5/5 stars for me."
"836",3,"  After all these years, Hollywood bringing to life so many game adaptations, but almost all of these movies failed miserably. And now, in 2018, the director, Roar Uthaug and Alicia Vikander bring to life THE best game adaptation. Of course, the movie plot is still simple and predictable BUT, don't forget the fact: The Tomb Raider games was never more than that! This movie is FUN, packed with good action, the visuals are great also the music. Most importantly, Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft! I follow her carrier from the begining, so I knew she's an amazing actress, but still, her performance is blow me away! In this movie, the villain is not just some random dude, who want's to rule the world. He has some good and solid opinions why he do what he do. Walton Goggins performance is top notch as always. The one thing I missing is her relationship with her family. I think with some more backstory he could be more relatable character.The father-daughter relationship was well written, but they used that flashback scene too much, I think. I don't wanna tell more because that will be a spoiler but if you curious, Dominic West was great and he's character had some surprising development.And the last thing I've missed is, more Daniel Wu scenes and character development. I hope, when they make a sequel, they will bring him back some more action.Lastly, if you wanna see some copy paste game adaptation, or just want to see boobs, this is not yours movie. BUT, if you like fun and thrilling movies with good drama, than, go and watch Tomb Raider!"
"837",1.5,"  ""Tomb Raider"" (PG-13, 1:58) is a reboot of the erstwhile Angelina Jolie franchise (with 2001 and 2003 ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" films). All the movies are based on the British ""Tomb Raider"" action-adventure video game series, which came on the scene in 1996. Like the games, the movies have used various combinations of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Lara Croft"" (the franchises' central character) in their titles. Naming tweaks aside, the question is if the 2018 changes in casting & approach pay off for Movie Fans. While Jolie's casting and portrayal matched the look and attitude of the video game heroine, Oscar winner Alicia Vikander brings a leaner and less mean Lara Croft to the big screen. Jolie brought the bad-ass female archaeologist/adventurer to life with a lot of swagger, but Vikander's Croft is more physically and emotionally vulnerable, full of fight, but yet to realize her potential, intellectually or in practice. The quality both characterizations share is intelligence and guts, but 2018's ""Tomb Raider"" is an origin story.Seven years after the disappearance of her father, wealthy businessman and adventurer Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), Lara is a woman with no plan. Obviously intelligent, she's content trying to be a mixed martial artist and working as a bicycle messenger. She wouldn't have to work at all, if she would just sign the documents declaring her father legally dead so she can inherit his company and his fortune, but she's having a very hard time letting go of the hope that her father, whom she idolizes, is still alive.When company officer (and Lara's former legal guardian), Ana Miller (Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas), finally convinces Lara to swing by the office and sign those papers, Lara receives a Japanese puzzle box that her father left her. Solving the puzzle leads Lara to the discovery of what her father was really working on when he disappeared - trying to find the tomb of a legendary Japanese queen who supposedly possessed the power of life and death. Still hoping to find her father alive (or at least learn what happened to him), the clues lead Lara to Japan where she hires a reluctant but down-on-his-luck boat captain (Daniel Wu) to take her into the Devil's Sea to a remote island which is notoriously difficult to reach. Upon reaching the island, Lara discovers the ruthless Mathias Vogel (Emmy nominee Walter Goggins) leading an expedition to find the tomb for a mysterious international organization.Vikander's ""Tomb Raider"" (directed by Roar Uthaug) is a joyless, by-the-numbers actioner. In spite of Vikander's considerable talent and gravitas, she feels miscast as the tough and determined young adventurer. With the understanding that this is a Lara Croft origin story, it just becomes mind-numbing to see her beaten up throughout the movie, while none of the actors' performances rise about the level of serviceable. The script (by Evan Daugherty and Geneva Robertson-Dworet) features unnecessary dialog, characters whose motivations make little sense and a story which is mostly very predictable. Disappointing. ""C"""
"838",2,"  Regretted having gone to see it. Very slow moving, and dull. Alicia Vikander is not a patch on AJ and even the rest of the cast was extremely lack lustre."
"839",5,"  A decent homage to the rebooted franchise. Alicia Vikander is excellent."
"840",3.5,"  A good adventure film let down by a weak plot which lacks originality. The plot is serviceable with good characters, great acting and really good character development of the more human Lara Croft. The action scenes are good, but the CGI is poor and overall, the film is missing the spark that makes it great. Nowhere near as dark or violent as the game, and don't bother going to watch it in 3D - apart from 1 scene, there isn't any."
"841",5,"  Great for fans. My friend and I had a great time. You'll be cheering Lara on the whole time."
"842",0.5,"  She's just not Lara croft she's a good actress just not a good fit in this role movies boring not really worth seeing"
"843",4.5,"  Pretty entertaining and fresh take on the character."
"844",3,"  Tomb Raider (2018) - Review The GoodAlcia Vikander is Lara Croft, she does not phone it in she doesn't speak much in certain scenes, but Vikander is such a great actress her body shows it. A way better Tomb Raider than Angelina Jolie who was basically a cartoon. It 100% nails the tone of the 2013 much better than this Video GameThe Action Sequences are surprisingly good and has pretty good visual effects for a Video Game movie.The Score is pretty goodThe BadIt feels Pretty long - The first act feels bloated of exposition and it takes 40 minutes just to get the damn island, in the game it took a few minutes. There was no reason why this was longer than 100 minutes.The biggest weakness is the script its Dull and Exposition heavy that has to explain everything to you, if you know the game you know this story, but they change certain things. The Supporting Cast is wasted - Dominic West is just there, Nick Frost is only in 2 scenes, Daniel Wu barely does anything. The biggest crime is Walton Goggins is a generic villain, its mostly a paycheck for these actors.Some emotional beats work and some don't If you seen the first trailer then you saw the obvious sequel bait ending with her in a ponytail and a gun with Nick Frost, so good job dumbass Marketing Overall: I think this is a good step into the right direction for Video Game Movies cause this is the closest one yet way better than a lot of video game movies Cough Shit Resident Evil CoughOverall Grade: C+"
"845",5,"  If you've played the game do not expect the exact same story line. It's changed a little bit but still great non the less. Very action packed! Loved it!"
"846",4,"  When I saw that the critics were giving a poor score to this movie I thought ""Probably this is one I will love"". Not because I purposelly go against the critics, but generally because their point of view ends being not on par with my tastes (see ""The Last Jedi"", for example).The movie is very loyal to the game that rebooted the franchise in 2013, and it¥s almost perfect,, if not by some minor changes in the main plot.Anyway, it¬¥s funny and he new actress fit very well to the role of Lara Croft."
"847",5,"  A fun movie with good action scenes that will make happy even those who have never played the game of 2013. It's a good movie based on games and deserves all respect. the actress is perfect in the role and the facilities of the script is given for trying to be too faithful to the game condesando 18 hours of gameplay in 2 hours of screen. it is certainly better that the two Jolie films put together and a continued large budget would be a good start to solidify the saga."
"848",4,"  Way underrate by the critics... sorry to see that.Its a pretty good down to earth video game adaptation..."
"849",2.5,"  The movie is a 6/10 for me . It was almost nothing like the game . Alicia vikander is a great lara croft. The dialogue was ass . Walton goggings didnt do the character he was suppose to good but that's obv the writers fault but in terms of his acting all he did the whole movie was look suprised and talked slow . The movie lacks emotion , it's like no one was alicia was trying . There's a decent amount of cheesy action movie stuff . About 3 good scenes that had me on the edge . Movie gets better as it goes . First hour was kinda dull and could have been sped up . But in total a fun watch ."
"850",4,"  This was the 1st time I ever got the chance to watch TOMB RAIDER. And I have to say I really liked it. It's nothing like the old TOMB RAIDER. With Angelina Jolie. It's based off the Award-winning game from 2012. So I wish people would give it a chance"
"851",5,"  Awesome! Movie! Nice Reboot of The Franchise Great Action Great Story Must See!"
"852",2,"  Vikander does what she can with this story. It's a shame the story doesn't amount to much. The movie tries something original through the first half giving you a close in view of the action, from the characters perspective instead of the typical 10,000 foot view where the story arc is clearer, unfortunately, as the movie gets into the 3rd act the director has done very little plot development and resorts to tropes and hand waving to get to an unsatisfactory conclusion. Walton Goggins is the worst cast ever as the villain. Zero weight or menace to his character."
"853",4,"  A faithful creation to the games, but not a copy paste film. I would recommend it if you like action or adventure films."
"854",2,"  This was a subpar cliche action flick that just happened to be called Tomb Raider. It was so loosely based off the games and the story of Lara Croft that it felt like it ripped the franchise off. If you havent ever played the new games then this may just be another ok action flick to you. However it was untrue to the story and spirit of Lara Croft.Alicia Vikander was the best part of the film. Everything else was either ridiculous or just meh. The story was one of the most uncompelling origin film stories every. The new games are such a better cinematic experience themselves, that I would instead recommend playing them through or watching someone play them through than watch this film."
"855",4,"  This depiction is more true to the reboot. I think the story was strong as a whole. Especially given this tired genre. I feel they did it justice even if they changed the story of the villains and made it less mythical."
"856",3,"  Alicia Vikander is absolutely incredible in a poorly-written, underwhelming adaptation. Cut the first hour of exposition in London and give us more of her journey in Yamatai. That's what made the new games so incredible. Also, Dominic West's character arc (and involvement in the story overall) was a major dud."
"857",3,"  Alicia Vikander tries her best but is still unable to create something memorable in this typical, ordinary, everyday & predictable action flick. Though Vikander is brilliant, the supporting cast drags her down in each & every scene. As far as origin stories go, this could have also been done much much better. Nevertheless, while doubtful, a hypothetical sequel with Alicia reprising her role but with a different director & scriptwriter would still be welcomed.(Updated from 15/03/2018)"
"858",2,"  Surprisingly, it isn't terrible! It's a fun and entertaining film within a tolerable run time of 111 minutes that feels more like a live action video game than a movie."
"859",4.5,"  Alicia did great as a young Lara Croft. She was resourceful and believable as Lara. The action was great and thankfully the special effects were great too. Not too much CGI like some fake reviews may suggest. Whatever cgi was there was more believable than some of those in MCU movies. It is a movie that I'll go back and see again. Runtime was nearly 2 hours but it didn't feel that long because the movie kept your interest."
"860",5,"  SAw Tomb Raider last night. my 9 year old daughter loved it. strong film for her. she says 10 of 10."
"861",4,"  Didn't expect to like this remake but it was pretty fun. i was disappointed in the lack of character development and the main character spent about 2/3 of the film squealing rather than communicating. Walton Goggins is always a great villain. This movie didn't stretch his skills too much though. Good action film but I was ready for it to be over by the end. I also wanted a continuing relationship with laura and lu which didn't materialize."
"862",5,"  could not be better! is the best adaptation of a videogame to the big screen, alicia vikander is tremendous, she push her limits in this movie as lara crof in the game !!"
"863",3,"  Over the years, many writers and directors have attempted to make solid films based on beloved video game franchises, but they've almost always failed. For that reason alone, the bar was already very low, so this review may need to be taken with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Tomb Raider is easily one of the best adaptations ever made. It's riddled with many of the same issues that previous attempts have, but these movies need to have a sense of fun and adventure, which I believe this film provides. This movie isn't going to be remembered as great, but it will almost always be present when speaking about the best films to come from a video game. If you're a fan of the games or just want to have a fun (even if disposable) time at the movies, then here's why I will absolutely recommend Tomb Raider to you.It's many years after the disappearance of her father and Lara Croft sets out on a journey to find a tomb that has been a mystery for years. Being the island that her father reportedly died at, she's faced with the sadness of her past. Filled with energy and fun action set pieces, this film clicks along at a fairly brisk pace, even though it does drag in some areas. It tries very hard to accomplish an emotional core in order to win over its audience in the third act, and for the most part, it works. The emotional core is one of the more enjoyable aspects about Tomb Raider, due to the fact that the performances here are truly what elevates this film from mediocre to good.Alicia Vikander continuously reminds audiences around the world that she's an actress who will be around for a very long time and I have zero complaints about that. Her portrayal of Lara Croft is far better than what Angelina Jolie brought to the role many years ago and the sense of adventure and story itself is also on a much more mature level. From Walton Goggins as the core villain to the short amount of screen time that Dominic West has as Lara's father, I can't commend this film enough for trying very hard with its characters. That being said, the screenplay itself could've used a few tweaks.Yes, as you can see, I was pleasantly surprised during my experience of Tomb Raider, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows I'm afraid. The dialogue definitely feels streamlined at times, not leaving enough clues for the audience to figure out the puzzles. They choose to allow the characters on-screen to reveal the answers after they've figured them out in their heads. On top of that, the climax of this film places every character in an impossible situation and it felt like I was watching someone try to accomplish an impossible task in an adventure-based video game. If you can forgive that, then the climax can be quite entertaining, but it's also very ridiculous and out of place when comparing it to the rest of the movie.In the end, Tomb Raider definitely won't make any top ten lists for 2018, nor will it be remembered as a great movie, but it's without question one of the best adaptations from a video game that's ever been made. It's not without a few glaring issues and the dialogue can be slightly generic and cringe-worthy at times, but I'd be lying if I didn't call this a fun adventure flick with some terrific and devoted performances all around. For action junkies or fans dying to see a decent adaptation for once, I feel no shame in recommending this one. I'm happy to say that this isn't a bad film and I would actually love if they're able to make a sequel. That may not be saying much for some people, but that seems like a fairly strong statement to me."
"864",4.5,"  Follows like an Indiana Jones film, mixed with the action drama of a mission impossible film. Enjoyable action movie."
"865",3,"  It was entertaining, Alicia did a great job as Lara Croft. She was a much more realistic take on the character like the recent video games. This was far less cheesy than the Angelina Jolie films. Overall a decent film."
"866",5,"  Wonderful reboot of Lara Croft-----Alicia Vikander is superb in this wild adventure fantasy movie, go see it!"
"867",1.5,"  I went in with an open mind. I am a fan of the original games and the reboot. I had cautious hopes after reading some reviews and when a friend got tickets to a preview I decided to give this film a chance after getting burned by Assassin's Creed last year. What a disappointment. For a big budget Hollywood film with a supposedly talented actress this one falls flat and would be a lame duck even for a Syfy Original Movie. No charm, no fun. Just CGI and noise. This is one to save for streaming...if at all. Video game curse alive and well..."
"868",5,"  This is the best videogame movie ever! Alicia Vikander is even better then Angelina Jolie. Storywise: it has the nice touch of the 2013's Tomb Raider and 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider games, and it's because that this movie follows closely that storyline wich makes it special."
"869",4,"  I find if I do the opposite of what the RT critics say I will like the movie."
"870",5,"  It set the grounds for a lot of good things to come!"
"871",4.5,"  Don't listen to the critics if you're looking for a great adventure. If you lack imagination and have no interest in character development and puzzles, then don't see it. Alicia does a phenomenal job of capturing Lara, and adds a tremendous amount of depth while showing us how Lara becomes a hardened and skilled Raider. I loved seeing the small moments that have huge impacts on her and why she is the character we love. The things that happen and how she responds - is so real. I could completely identify with the inner conflicts she faces and that instantly made it more compelling to watch. Well filmed. Nothing overtly CGI. A few cheesy moments, but hey, this is entertainment. Not everyone wants to see depressingly accurate portrayals of circumstance. We're talking about booby traps and tombs people.... let yourself get lost in your imagination and enjoy the ride ;)"
"872",4,"  Overall this movie compliments the video game more than it copies it. As other reviewers have noted, if you played the recent prequel game than you have played through versions of this film which are nearly shot by shot live action remakes from the game. But I felt like overall the movie added a lot of value to the game more than competing against it. The first hour of the movie adds lots of exposition to the game to explain who Lara Croft was before the Tomb Raider, and who her family was. There is a lot of actually very interesting stuff in the first half of the movie that you do not get in the games and adds a lot of value to the games. About an hour in we get to the point where the video game starts (the shipwreck), which begins about another 30 minutes of shot by shot replication from the game (with one major change from the game's premise). Finally we get about 10 minutes of conclusion to the Tomb which wasn't in the game, an then the last 15 minutes of the movie tends to wrap up the story and mainly lead us to the other movie, showing how she turned into the Lara Croft that Angelina Jolie plays. So as you can see, the movie added a lot of value to the game, emphasising the parts of the medium that the movie is good at (storytelling) while the game offers more of the action sequences that games are good for. I feel like this is a great compliment of the medium and the game and the movie work very well together. Overall I think this is my favorite of the Tomb Raider movie series, and hope to see more in the future."
"873",5,"  I loved it. No idea where the hate is coming from."
"874",1.5,"  it feels like the protagonist and the movie are in different places. She is not Lara Croft, she is a different beast of her own, great actress but it is not the way to do the movie. A movie should have something else to stand out"
"875",3,"  A decent film based on the 2013 reboot franchise of Tomb Raider, however while entertaining it does feel like it rushes to get all the elements in the 2 hour time slot and yet coming up short with all of the scenes you WANT to see not quite satisfying you to the fullest. Ultimately the movie left me desiring more. Had it have been an hour longer with Lara Croft doing what she's known for, I wouldn't have much complain beyond that. Sadly the video game in which this movie is based told the origin story much better."
"876",1.5,"  The movie is a sad remake of a beloved character. The done to death formula has nothing new to offer and the average acting by supporting cast doesn't help the cause at all. Alicia is wonderful as the main lead but the supporting cast has nothing new to offer. Overall the movie is very bland and predictable with average dialogues and some good looking CGI in couple of the scenes."
"877",0.5,"  It¥s bad. Bad script. bad movie."
"878",4,"  I liked it. It wasnt perfect but has good fondations for a sequel."
"879",4.5,"  I really enjoyed it. It was exactly what i expected and didn't disappoint. Alicia was excellent as Lara and it was a great homage to the games."
"880",2.5,"  If you like the games, you may like this. If you like good movies you may not. I am stuck in between and found this movie a solid attempt. It's a paint-by-the-numbers adventure movie with nothing special to offer, but for a movie adaptation to a video game, it succeeds."
"881",5,"  best video game adaption yet! Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft breathes life and emotion into this reboot. The plot wasn't perfect but the way they set up the sequel and the action scenes make excited for a sequel. This is the female empowered action hero we deserve!"
"882",1.5,"  Wow this is bad... another bad adaptation of a good video game, sad."
"883",5,"  I literally made a rotten tomatoes account to rate this. I loved all the nods and throwbacks to the rebooted game and it made me happy to see how they made a plot that was different and interesting using the same elements. I can not wait for a sequel."
"884",4,"  Better than expected. Definitely am going to see the sequel"
"885",4.5,"  Alicia Vikander blew me away! A legit action star but grounded in reality and made you feel something. Loved the Lara backstory and seeing her being a relatable young woman, being cute and fun in London and then really coming her own throughout the movie. You really do see her turning into the action star we all know as the film progressed. A great night at the movies!"
"886",5,"  TOMB RAIDER IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ONE"
"887",5,"  Very good movie with an incredible actress! The origin story Lara Croft deserves and the best video game adaptation !"
"888",4.5,"  Alicia Vikander is fantastic in the title role. She brings depth and dimension and makes Lara incredibly relate-able. Her nuanced performance and the realistic tone help the film to succeed in perfectly capturing the unforgiving tone of the 2013 reboot Tomb Raider video game. I feel the trailers do not do the film justice. 7.5/10"
"889",4.5,"  Great movie, looking forward to sequel. Critics are so lame lol."
"890",4,"  Much better than the original Angelina Jolie movies. Alicia Vikander kills it as Lara Croft!"
"891",5,"  Going in I was worried and hesitant to what they were doing with Lara , making her a bike courier, etc. I am pleased to say, that I left last night with a huge smile on my face! It follows the game for a good chunk of the movie but they did change a lot and added a lot. Alicia Vikander did a fantastic job as a young Lara Croft and how she got started! I plan to see it a few more times while in theaters and can't wait for the next movie!"
"892",5,"  pROBABLY THE BEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE SINCE PRINCE OF PERSIA"
"893",5,"  What a great movie this was. A true breath of fresh air, unlike all the politically correct rubbish being churned out of late, this story really takes you on a journey. Now as usual the critics don't know a good movie if it slapped them in the face and I feel it's because they still have no clue on how to rate action as a genre and have little understanding of all the great things this movie did to reboot the franchise. Alicia Vikander is such a scraper in this film, she really has you caring for both her character and her cause, with an enjoyable heroes journey, rather than a Mary sue skip to the finish. Some may say this makes the story predictable, which I say, ""the tomb raider, raided a tomb. Wtf were your expectations?"" Now here is the action breakdown, where there scenes that were badass? Yes, congratulations this is indeed a good film. I personal can't wait for the next instalment of this saga."
"894",4.5,"  This is an origin story of Lara Croft, borrowing quite heavily from the rebooted 2013 game and the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider. in terms of action sequences Alicia Vikander absolutely nails it as Lara Croft bringing an emotional depth to the character, while also proving to be quite the action star. She worked hard for this role and it shows. The action scenes are tense, with a Lara who seems to be winging it much of the time, hoping for the best, while growing into her skills,and confidence. The film takes a more realistic route, while not taking itself too seriously, with a touch of humour to balance things out a little. My only real criticism is that the pacing near the end, once Lara escapes the tomb, felt a tad rushed. A must see for Tomb Raider and Alicia fans, and also if you like a good action adventure movie"
"895",5,"  Really Good. Has some great references to the reboot games that makes it feel like you can follow along and recognise elements of the storyline without making it boring by being exactly like the games. great to see lara becoming a badass, and seeing where she comes from in the world before heading off on her adventure. Vikanda does a fantastic job portraying croft, who feels familiar but also much more of a relatable character than previous portrayals. a must see for fans of the games, and thoroughly enjoyable to those who haven't played too."
"896",3,"  ????????????????????????????????????? 6.5/10"
"897",3.5,"  A decent adaptation of the first rebooted game. It keeps the overall broad strokes of the story while being its own thing. It ties the stories of the two games together more than the games themselves as the Trinity connection is not really evident until the second game. Alicia Vikander makes a great young Lara Croft that is more rooted in reality but still walking off some rather serious injuries. If this gets a sequel, and I am hoping it will. It will be interesting to see if follows the story of Rise and how it might bring in the more fantastical elements of the game."
"898",1.5,"  One of the worst adaptations i have ever seen. Wrong story, crucial parts of the story skipped and a lara that doesnt match the one in the game."
"899",3.5,"  Some interesting choices were made, but over all it feels like a Tomb Raider movie. And that's really all I wanted."
"900",5,"  I like the Tomb Raider series. I have a full collection of Tomb Raider games on steam. I guess this movie should be adapted from a 9th-generation game, but there are many different places. Laura, played by Alicia Veccan, is excellent and I like it very much. I think the original battle is better than the old 2 and hopefully there will be a second one."
"901",5,"  I am absolutely in love with this movie and although it has a few flaws, as a fan of the video game and know what the intention was story-wise (to take things from both rebooted games and some easter eggs and influences from older games and even movies), this was very well done and for me the video game curse has been broken thoroughly :)"
"902",5,"  Tomb Raider was good. As far as video game movies go, this was one of the best adaptations. Alicia Vikiander doesn't play the global-hopping, alien-fighting Lara Croft of the 90's, however, so if you're thinking this movie is going to have a stupid monster fight at the end, look elsewhere. This movie was more in line with Indiana Jones with a simple plot, good characters, and a really good ending. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Tomb Raider. It's not without its faults, but for an adventure movie based on a video game, you can do a lot worse."
"903",3.5,"  Solid 7 out of ten. Mostly because Alicia Vikander is excellent."
"904",4,"  Better than Jolie's version! Kids couldn't even watch Jolie's version all the way through they were so bored. This one the couldn't stop watching. Hopefully they will make another one as long as they keep Alicia!"
"905",3,"  Las pel√≠culas basadas en videojuegos suelen pasar sin pena ni gloria. Adaptar un producto de m√°s de cinco horas (jugando) es un verdadero reto; sin embargo, esta pel√≠cula logra funcionar por si sola y, pese a un comienzo lento y un villano mal ejecutado, tiene varios aciertos como la acci√≥n, efectos especiales y la trama con una relaci√≥n padre e hija bastante bella."
"906",3,"  AV does a great job in the most gloomy version of Lara Croft I ever saw.I never taught I would see a Lara Croft penniless, and less ladylike as this one.The plot is boring."
"907",0.5,"  what a piece of s**t."
"908",4,"  This is a fun movie to watch. Story wise make sense. I like Alicia as Lara Croft."
"909",4,"  Despite the harsh reviews, I really enjoyed the film. Although the script was awfully cliche at times and the story could have been developed further, they stayed true to the game, blending the 2013 reboot's Himiko storyline and Rise of The Tomb Raider's Trinity focus well. Cinematography was one of the highlights of the film, as was Vikander's performance. It was fun, didn't bore me a bit. A great video game adaptation."
"910",3.5,"  Nobody expected this to succeed. Alicia Vikander gives it her all but the story is too thin. However, there was enough momentum in the first and third acts for people to enjoy. It is better the Da Vinci Code series but less so than the stupidly fun National Treasure."
"911",3.5,"  Not the best but still not the worst I give it a solid 7 out of / 10"
"912",3.5,"  The movie was well made , and very fun. It was a nice introduction to the Character of Lara croft. Pleanty of action in the right spots. Well done."
"913",4.5,"  human, emotional and adventurous, enjoyed it"
"914",4,"  4/5 As far as video game adaptations go, this is a damn good one. I'd rank in right up there with Silent Hill ass one of my favorites. While the movie doesn't quite follow the story of the game, it has enough of the elements and little nods to make you go ""oh, that's just like in the game."" Complete with a great performance from Alicia Vikander, I'd say this is a huge step in the right direction for video game adaptations."
"915",4,"  Tomb Raider is a somewhat faithful adaptation of the recent 2013 video game of the same name. The cast of the movie are all great as the characters they play. The visual effects and CGI are noticeable at times but they don't pop and demand your attention. Someone just enjoying the movie will not notice it. The story of the movie is understandable but it definitely could've been done better. The score and other music in the movie is well used. Overall it's a really good and fun action movie."
"916",5,"  I can see how people who have never played ""Tomb Raider Definitive Edition"" or ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" would give this film a poor rating. For me, as an avid fan of both games, I appreciate how they recreated so much of the games sequences, but also how they made a very enjoyable film version that is appealing for a broader audience. Alicia makes for an amazing Lara, she's strong and capable, but also vulnerable and you feel excited to be part of her journey. People who are comparing the movie to the game and expecting the first to be an exact copy of the later are just crazy."
"917",4,"  Not going to lie, I thought this movie was going to be mediocre-godawful. I loved the game it was based off of, the reboot that square enix did(look it up, its amazing). This movie was solid, it had some very visceral action sequences.. it also had some reminders that ""hey this is a video game superhero"" because she def should have died or been paralyzed by a few things haha. That suspension of disbelief at moments was the only thing I knocked it a star for. Go see it, its a legit action flick, and she kills the role...shame on you jolie...shame lol"
"918",5,"  It was a really fun movie and really felt like the games on edge powerful tension."
"919",5,"  Alicia Vikander is great in this, I also loved the action, 5 stars from me."
"920",5,"  Surprisingly good and exhilarating."
"921",5,"  I really enjoyed Tomb Raider, much more than i expected to. It's a fun throwback to the old Indiana Jones movies, with some great action and set pieces. But it's really Alicia Vikander that sells this thing . Her Lara Croft is more real, more vulnerable than the Angelina Jolie characterization. She is not a superhero, but a human being who makes mistakes, gets injured and really feels like she is in way over head, which adds stakes to her journey. And Alicia is such a talented actress, bringing so much nuance to the role that it is hard to keep your eyes off her. I hope that people give this film a shot, and that it ends up generating sequels. I want to see more of Alicia Vikander as Lara Crioft!"
"922",1,"  I was excited to see Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft and Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, the supporting actor... Despite their performances, the movie was disappointing. The plot was straightforward and dull with forcefully added ""exotic"" moments where the enslaved island workers tried to communicate with Wu in cantonese with a weird accent. At the beginning of the movie, the representation of Hong Kong was outrageous; from the string of little red lanterns at the back of the cab to the ""fishing village"" in Aberdeen. If the director chose to show the present modern image of London in the movie, there seemed to be either a mismatch of time or Croft didn't only travel to Hong Kong, but also time travelled back to the 80s to search for Lu Ren and his boat albeit showing an equally present aerial shot of Hong Kong before all the nonsense happen.All in all, glad to see a diverse mix of actors and actress in the movie and Vikander's Lara Croft was not objectified in the movie."
"923",2.5,"  Second rate plot and dialog, some shoddy acting..sadly it met the expectations that the trailer set for me. Alicia Vikander was not the problem though."
"924",3.5,"  Not sure why reviews are so split on this, because the movie is actually pretty good."
"925",4,"  Is the new Tomb Raider merely a Japanese-themed version of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Yes. It is still very well acted, entertaining. It knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers on it."
"926",2.5,"  A pretty average action film. Based on the 2013 reboot video game Tomb Raider this movie stars the excellent Alicia Vikander stars as Lara Croft who in this version is a bike courier hiding from her past. After her father Richard Croft (Dominic West) goes missing 7 years in the past Lara lives life not knowing what happened to him. One day when Lara is about to inherit all of her fathers fortune she uncovers a puzzle he left for her which leads her to a secret room where an old video of Richard reveals what he was last working on. This leads Lara across the globe where she hires a boat captain named Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) to take her to a mysterious island off the coast of Japan. There Laura and Lu discover a man named Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) who works for a mysterious group called Trinity that is trying to discover the secrets of the islands. Soon enough it's up to Laura stop Mathias and discover what her father died trying to prevent! So first off the movie does pay a lot of homage to the 2013 game and even has a pretty loose plot following it, but it does fall quite s bit flat. Lu is an unnecessary character and I felt like they should have used the original character he's slightly based on from the game instead for a more emotional connection to Laura. The bad guy here isn't bad and they even try to make him a humane character by having relatable goals, but for me it never worked here. I will say I did enjoy Alicia Vikander as Laura and hope if there's sequels she gets to develop the character even more. The dialogue in this film is sometimes so hammy and atrocious it takes away from the film. some CG isn't the greatest, but for the most part a majority of it looks great. The action is pretty intense, but it still had a slightly anti-climatic ending. Overall, I would say it's worth a rent if you're a fan of the series. Vikander does well here and works with what she's got. Anyone else not a fan should probably steer clear."
"927",5,"  Tomb Raider is everything a Video Game based movie should be. You find yourself on the edge of your seat with the suspense and anxiety that comes with this fast-paced action flick."
"928",4.5,"  It was a great concept and story the actress I cannot remember her name at the moment was great throughout the whole movie with her emotional connection to the text the score was spot on and mixed very well and the cinematography was good. The bad is there are some clique moments and also visual effects need a little touch up other than that great great movie"
"929",5,"  Excellent, faithful to the tomb raider reboot and the original. Alicia Vikander is a superb young Lara. Impatiently awaiting the sequel!!"
"930",3.5,"  What is immediately recognizable in this film is the quality of the performances. The emotions and responses are refreshingly organic and believable. This is an action film that earns every step it takes. It was great seeing Lara's journey. Her transformation from traveller to survivalist to adventurer is well-done. The action is great. This is a must-see for fans of the rebooted games and those yearning for a classic adventure tale with some modern touches."
"931",4,"  I liked this version with Alicia Vikander because the director kept it more realistic of a female in action versus Angolie's version which was more cartoonish and too commercial. Laura Croft in this version didn't always beat up everybody and found easy ways to escape. This Croft was more realistic and convincing of bravery rather than simple butt kicking throughout the movie. I give it 4 stars."
"932",5,"  If you enjoy the video games by square eqix you will love this movie. Lara is at a crossroads in her life and she refuses to believe her father is dead, but is pressured to sign the paperwork, instead she takes of on an adventure to find him. The movie has the feel of the games, but it has its own unique story and I have no complaints about the acting, storyline, or cinematography. I was enthralled and on the edge of my seat. Great movie can't wait to see the next movie!"
"933",5,"  I thought the movie was pretty great! I keep stopping myself from saying amazing because though I don't think it was a perfect attempt it was EXACTLY what I wanted. Acted perfectly and as absurd as it needed to be to match the thrill of the games that fans LOVE SO MUCH. Go see this film!"
"934",1,"  Achievement unlocked! They managed to make the Jolie movies look halfway decent!Wasting the rich material they can draw from, Hollywood yet again dumbs it down for casual audiences - all in the name of ""world building"" and setting up the franchise for multiple entries down the line. You had one job, Hollywood. You just needed to follow the rebooted game's formula. And you still mucked it up. And who tf wrote the shitty screenplay?! How on earth did this project get greenlit?!You wasted Vikander's talent on shoddy scenario direction, a pedestrian script, and bland cinematography.I never write movie reviews during my free time, yet here we are.It's another case of a good game gone bad movie. ????"
"935",4,"  True to the story it was based off. Fun, engaging, entertaining. Won't win any awards but worth a watch and a must watch for fans of the franchise."
"936",4,"  True to the game it was based from, Tomb Raider is action packed and intense all the way throughout. This movie is pleasantly exaggerated just enough to match that of the video game. Alicia does an excellent job portraying a naive and innocent Lara Croft. This movie was done with enough care that a sequel is almost guaranteed. And well deserved."
"937",5,"  Vikander is outstanding! Tomb Raider all in all is an enjoyable and action-packed thrill ride with spirit; well worth the watch in theaters and a great start to the reboot!!"
"938",3,"  So it's not a bad movie but it's not great ether. The problem is tomb raider is a 40hr game. It's not impossible but it's pretty damn hard. High lights were seeing ur favorite scenes done on the big screen. The cast was good Lara croft was great but she's a academy award winning actress and she put a lot of work in to the character. So is it worth seeing yah but maybe matinee or 1sr screening. As far as video game movies go it's one of the best but thats not saying much."
"939",5,"  BEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE TO DATE !"
"940",2,"  Not a huge disappointment, but with no original ideas or vision and cliches atop other cliches it just barely makes it into the ""passable"" category."
"941",3,"  It was better than I expected. I wasn't expecting much. Alicia gave a good performance and they incorporated elements from the game in a reasonable way. If you're a Tomb Raider fan then you shouldn't miss this film."
"942",3.5,"  It was an enjoyable movie to watch. There were parts that were lacking but overall, for a movie based off of a video game, they didn't muck it up too much to where it is unwatchable."
"943",4,"  Tomb Raider is a good start to what hopefully becomes a perfect trilogy. We get a nice origin story with a character that is realistic and deals with issues that make her doubt herself and finds the ability to overcome hardships. The action scenes are filled with excitement. The violence more brutal than I expected considering the rating. All good things for a character like Lara Croft who has been a staple is the video world."
"944",0.5,"  This movie had no idea what it was doing. When I saw it there was no reminants of the game they got lots of information wrong and cut out a huge portion of story. over all it wasn't really a good movie It mostly made me want to play the video game"
"945",4.5,"  This is the best Tomb Raider Movie since 2001 flim! I don't care it's SUCKED!"
"946",3.5,"  Effective, entertaining and a solid start. This new Tomb Raider is full of clich√™s of the genre, but still works most of the time, Alicia Vikander is excellent as the title role of Lara Croft and sequence of actions are more fun that you could hope for. (3,5/5)"
"947",0.5,"  ""Tomb Raider""? More like ""Disney Princess in the Forest"". Horribly generic and boring, Vikander is completely miscast as ""Lara Croft"". Designed to please Social Justice Warriors while spitting in the face of millions of fans, it doesn't even make a good chick flick. Square Enix have allowed political correctness to destroy this once beloved icon. Any positives comments you read about this film is political bias, because, as a film, this is terrible from top to bottom."
"948",5,"  It was alright, still think Tom Holland's uncharted will be better."
"949",5,"  So much fun. I might go see it again."
"950",4,"  As someone who has played both reboot games, my expectations were mixed.I knew on a 90 million dollar budget they weren't going to be able to give us more of the video game, However, That's not to say the team behind this movie weren't going to figure out how give us alot of that Lara I came to love from the hours of moving her through puzzle after puzzle and danger after danger.Alicia Vikander has all the physical tools and she displayed them in this movie.I could tell from some of the scenes she really put her body through some tough moments to give us that shot.As I sat through the movie, Alicia's Lara grew more and more on me.I could tell she's a woman who had played the games and wanted to do justice to the part and for that I am thankful.I appreciate the plot twist in regards to Himiko and I feel Walton Goggins has the face for Mathias. Walton always has looked like someone who escaped the looney bin and Mathias needed that look to sell the part so thumbs up for casting Walton.So yeah. Really good action movie with a solid foundation from the game. 4 stars and here is to hoping it makes enough money to greenlight a sequel with double the budget so we can get 'Rise of' with more justice done."
"951",5,"  it's amazing! I love Alicia playing Lara! I love the director of the movie and the production of art! but the script could be better"
"952",5,"  The Movie is so Intense, With full of Intense moment, and so unpredictable. But"
"953",4.5,"  That was way better than expected! Awesome!"
"954",5,"  I liked it. It was nice to go see a movie that wasn't so politically charged and was made to entertain.This version of Laura Croft is a young vulnerable one who is strong, smart and determined. It was a lot of fun to watch on her progress on screen.Not a perfect movie but definitely worth the watch in theaters. I gave it five stars because it deserves much better than the %50 it has on rotten tomatoes."
"955",5,"  If you have played the games, you will love this movie! If not - maybe. There are many moments that pay homage to the games - where if you don't get the references you might think they're using unnecessary camera angles, or nonsensical action, etc. If you do get the references, it's brilliant."
"956",5,"  A strong re-boot. I love Alicia as the new Lara. I feel like the Jolie movies focused more on Lara being a Sex-symbol when she is clearly so much more. She is strength, intelligence and a role model for women. This new movie really portrayed that for me. While the movie isn't identical to the 2013 game it certainly has some matching elements and lots of non stop action.I'd see it again!"
"957",1.5,"  all audience on my row went to washroom during the talking plot"
"958",4,"  It was better than the average video game movie. The dialogue was average, but the actions sequences and sheer coolness of seeing Alicia Vikander pull off the Lara Croft stunts had everyone in the cinema cheering."
"959",4.5,"  I really want to see Lara in action. Cause I love tomb raider games, this movie have potential"
"960",5,"  Watched this splendid piece of cinematography today in an IMAX cinema, and was blown away by the action, great acting, and amazing visual and sound effects! Cannot recommend this movie more and I must say, that this might be one of my favorite movies yet. Hoping for a second one."
"961",5,"  Went into the movie optimistic it would mesh the mythology of the characters from the game as well as a grounded realityru and am delighted to say that I left the cinema very happy. Don't really see what people are being negative about the movie for, yes it's not going to win an Oscar but it delivers exactly what it intends, an adventure with a fantastic lead female and good supporting cast. The stakes feel real, the story is great and sucks you in to want to know what happens to our heroine next, roll on the sequel. If resident evil got 5 Movies by spitting out garbage then in comparison Tomb Raider should get at least 1 sequel. My rating is 9/10 simply because it ended! Will definitely watch again!"
"962",3.5,"  Based on the most recent run of Tomb Raider video games comes this new and improved Tomb Raider film which grounds the adventures of Lara Croft closer to reality than Angelina Jolie's 2001 adaptation. The story follows a pre-tomb raiding Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) who after a shock discovery decides to venture towards her missing father's last known location and uncover the secrets about what happened to him. I honestly didn't have the highest of expectations going into this film as the trailers were decent but not incredible. It all hinged on whether the film could emulate a similar feel to the Square Enix video game which is very action packed and exciting. And thankfully I feel like this adaptation exhibits the tone of the Tomb Raider video games very well and has formulated a story that works for the big screen. There is an absolute tonne of fun to be had here, the story itself may be very paint-by-numbers all the way through but there's plenty of tense action sequences, puzzle solving and thrilling chase sequences to keep you invested.I need to kick this off by highlighting the incredible Alicia Vikander and her fantastic performance as a very strong and believably capable Lara Croft who I may even prefer over Jolie. She has a certain charm about her that makes her a likeable protagonist and can also pull out the survival skills when she needs to and kick some ass. She has a very charismatic, determined, and strong-willed personality and overall she's just a very well fleshed out character who we see only get stronger with each passing moment. And when you have someone as immensely talented as Alicia Vikander it only enhances every one of her scenes as she proves here time and time again she can do the dramatic and emotional just as well as she can pull off action sequences convincingly. As far as villains go, Walton Goggins plays Mathias Vogel and he is great because he just has one of the most punchable faces in cinema and that is no different here. For the most part he plays a pretty generic villain with a simple goal in mind but Goggins does bring a certain level of charisma to the role that sparks some life in him. They do briefly try to flesh the character out a little more and give him a bit of a loose backstory for some added depth but it's never fully delved into.Daniel Wu plays Lu Ren, someone who assists Laura on her journey and for his limited screen time he's decent in the role. The problem with his character is he doesn't really have much to do over the course of the film so when the story does occasionally check in with him it's more of a distraction than it is intriguing.The story itself as I've mentioned is very generic, I mean, you can probably lay out beat for beat the entire series of events by the end of the first act, and that has nothing to do with knowing the events of the game as this takes a large number of liberties. But also the fact that it's very generic doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad as the action sequences and constant fast moving pace keep up the excitement level and I was very much invested for the majority of the last two acts. I left actually surprised at how thrilling some of the action-adventure sequences are and how well they are filmed to where I was genuinely on the edge of my seat for a number of moments. There are a handful of moments where the CGI isn't completely up to scratch and it's momentarily noticeable but I mean, due to the amount of fun I was having I barely took notice of it. As far as the tone goes it takes itself pretty seriously and isn't constantly going for the joke, which I think worked for the story. It feels a lot like the Tomb Raider game (which is obviously good) and even Uncharted at times without Nathan Drake's smartassery outlining every scene. There's one, maybe two moments where it does go for the joke unsuccessfully and it doesn't need to because it goes against the tone established early on.So overall I'm glad to say I enjoyed almost all of this Tomb Raider origin story reboot and had a tonne of fun from beginning to almost end. It does something with its final moments which I really wish it didn't do because it's extremely unnecessary and it doesn't have much of a bearing on the story being told within this film. It's disappointing they decided to close it off how they did but the rest of the movie can still be very much enjoyed. Alicia Vikander I can't stress enough about how great she is in the role and proved everyone who was doubting her ability to play Lara Croft convincingly very wrong. Video game movies have constantly struggled to adapt the game's story into a movie suitable format, and I'd say Tomb Raider has cemented itself as one of the better ones and well worth the watch.6.8/10"
"963",5,"  After searching so many years for a good video game adaptation film, finally Tomb Raider comes along. For those who have played the recent games Tomb Raider 2013 and Rise of the Tomb Raider there are plenty of moments, beats, segments and nods to get you excited. I went to see it with a friend who hadn't played the new games and enjoyed it as much as i did. As always with newer films there gives us lots of bread crumbs for the potential sequel, which i'm hoping happens. Ignore the critics on this one and make up your own mind. I'll be going again soon. A great movie and Alicia IS Lara Croft"

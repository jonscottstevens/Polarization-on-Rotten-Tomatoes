"1",0.5,"  I will forever be haunted by Johnny Depp saying, ""let's dance."" Gnomeo was hot and gentlemanly (yummy). Highly disappointed by the fact that Sherlock and Watson did not hook up in the end, although Watson did subtly graze Sherlock's butt in the final scene. I think you should get yourself a man who treats you like the strongest gnome in the garden. It was trippy when Sherlock went to the ""black and white"" world of his mind. It sort of felt like I was on an intense high all throughout the duration of this cinema masterpiece. I cringed at the sight of the thicc pie boy, who for some reason had a small selfie stick. I wanted to cry when I saw the dabbing gnome. Overall, I would see this movie again both to laugh at its stupidity and to stare at Gnomeo's muscular physique?."

"4",5,"  This was an amazing movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best ever"
"5",1,"  Too predictable. Not fun... It's a miss!"
"6",0.5,"  Waste of time, as usual."
"7",5,"  This movie is so much fun. The writing is clever, witty, and funny, and the Elton John Songs are fabulous."
"8",5,"  My names Mary, I'm 66, and while I was watching Paul, Apostle of Christ, there was an ad for this very film. All the flapjacks in the audience didn't bulge, but I was laughing my toohinkers off. Everyone seemed quite garbled off at my psychopathic laughing, but I didn't care because I was jimplejahooking at this hilarious piece of cinematography."
"9",5,"  My wife and I loved it! Way better than we anticipated. We're both 70, and neither one of us had seen the first Gnomes movie. I don't know what those professional critics are grumbling about, because ""Sherlock"" impressed us as being a fast, funny, and visually imaginative entertainment. The thematic elements were good points to make and were well-expressed. Would we have seen it without our Movie Pass cards? Probably not, but thanks to our wonderful MP membership, we took a chance on this one. So glad we did... and by the way: The movie theater was empty when we saw it. We were the only two customers."

"12",2,"  Sherlock GnomesInitial Reaction: Gee, wonder who's going to show up in this film.Main Characters Sherlock Gnomes: He's Sherlock Holmes if he was a gnome. He's voiced by Johnny Depp Dr. Watson: Sherlock's faithful assistant. He's voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor Gnomeo, Juliet: Two lawn gnomes voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt.Plot Summary A crime wave has hit across a neighborhood in London. Every single lawn gnome has vanished and there's one guy made for the job: Sherlock Gnomes. He and Dr. Watson have to follow the clues left behind by the culprit to find out where the lawn gnomes are. And they are going to get help from Gnomeo and Juliet - no matter if they want the help or not.SCORINGMain Characters They do a good job of showing Sherlock as the arrogant, egotistical know it all. And I also liked Watson as the quiet assistant who does what he's told. But Gnomeo and Juliet are really bland in this film. You could've substituted any two other gnomes and have gotten the same result. SCORE: 5Supporting Cast The rest of the lawn gnomes aren't really memorable - but they're not as bad as Moriarty. Sherlock's nemesis is portrayed as a creepy cute human kid (at least that's what I think he is). I really didn't like that. The master criminal deserved a lot better than this. SCORE: 2Plot The main plot goes about the standard business of following the clues - but the scenes don't really add up to anything special - except for the big reveal near the end of the film. SCORE: 4Originality This film is your standard mystery film. Making almost everyone a lawn gnome just doesn't do much for the story. SCORE: 4Violence Factor Not a lot - except for the many, many times a gnome is threatened to get smashed. Other than that, the confrontations between Sherlock and Moriarty have very little pop in them. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film has a romantic pairing between a frog and a lawn gnome - which just feels wrong.  Besides, there are times when Sherlock should be more through than he is in this film. He makes a few really bad mistakes that no other Sherlock would make. SCORE: 3Final Score (out of 60): 22 % Score: 36.67%Here's an idea - have an original story with the lawn gnomes instead of adapting some other person's work."
"13",5,"  Best mother trucking movie"
"14",4.5,"  it's fucking awesome movie!"
"15",1.5,"  The preview was funnier than the movie, and the part from the preview didn't make it."
"16",0.5,"  its a movie about gnomes with sherlock holmes in it, do i have to say anything else?"
"17",5,"  It was different which I liked"
"18",5,"  Really funny!! I wish there would have been more original songs like last movie, but still very good! Will buy! I missed the flamingos!"
"19",2,"  Should I start mentioning its empty plot, scattered chasing sequences that are put one after another with no reason, its absurd and silly jokes that just are not funny? I can't even remember if I smiled once while watching this stupid movie ..... no no hold a second, I think I smiled once because they used the wilhelm scream and I believe that at this time I was supposed to cry or something.Of course the villain is so weak and his backstory and motives don't make any sense. By the way, the villain is just a miserable try to make a version of the joker in The Lego Batman Movie.The most infuriating thing is that the movie tries to make you feel it's smart; showing 2D animated scenes to display the way Sherlock Gnomes thinks or how he tries to solve the mystery and all that absolutely nonsensical. Also, there is a plot twist that is presumed to be surprising.there are man many other problem but let's get over them and mention the very few things that I liked in this movie:- The animation quality is surprisingly quite good.- James McAvoy's and Johnny Depp's voice acting are the only two that are kinda good but the other actors aren't good (Emily Blunt's voice acting is very idle)- The first 20 minutes are fast paced so I think this is a bonus! (The pace dragged every once in awhile due to ""dramatic"" moments or just to play some songs)I'm so disappointed that this movie came from John Stevenson, the same director who brought us Kung Fu Panda. (4.5/10)"
"20",3.5,"  Cute movie with nice fluidity"
"21",4,"  Not only did this movie cure my cancer, but also the cancer of my already deceased grandma's dog. Gnomeo played the most important role as the comical anti-hero and serious protagonist, but Juliet's poor driving did not follow my religion as it expands the stereotype that women are bad drivers. Watson was my favorite grandpa but least favorite enemy. Overall a great movie that deserves the Nobel prize."
"22",2,"  A lot of plot twists but they didint really tie up at the end and way to much problems that at the end didint add up..."
"23",3.5,"  For starters I do say this movie would be a fun family movie and is a great little adventure, I must say that the ending was predictable and you could see it from the beginning. Overall the movie is not terrible, just predictable."
"24",4,"  The story line is shallow but the visuals are stunning."
"25",3.5,"  I fell asleep watching Up."
"26",3,"  Seen it, not very good."
"27",5,"  My 2 year old's favorite movie. We watch it every day. Super cute. Surprisingly I don't get bored with it."
"28",5,"  Heart warming, inspiring and one of a kind. Great family friendly movie"
"29",1,"  Did you actually expect this movie to be good? If you did, seek help."
"30",5,"  Great for the whole family!"
"31",4.5,"  Sherlock Gnomes... With all the hype surrounding it, it not only exceeded expectations, but it set new standards for film-making and cinematography. Gnomeo and Juliet was never meant to be a stand alone movie and without this masterpiece following it up,it would have felt incomplete. This movie expanded on the lore surrounding the extremely well recieved first film. In short, this series is the toy story for old white women's backyards. 9/10 good flick"
"32",0.5,"  Having just seen Sherlock Gnomes, I have no desire to sit through Gnomeo and Juliet. A few scenes made me smirk, but I was mostly as unmoved as a lawn ornament."
"33",5,"  I'm surprised about the weak reviews for this movie. I fully enjoyed this movie. I like the storyline, the characters and the limping hero. I feel the writing was well done and I have already watched it several times"
"34",5,"  best animated film ever made !!!!!"
"35",1.5,"  At least it was short. It didn't feel like it though."
"36",2,"  I'm not sure that there needed to be a sequel to Gnomeo and Juliet...but...frankly, that could be said of almost every film. Regardless, we got one. Nothing is very inspired here. The plot drags and the characters are as wooden as their complexion. It will even be tough coaxing much excitement from the little ones."
"37",2.5,"  Grade: B-Rating: PG, 86 minutesIn a Nutshell: With original music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this gnome animation is a gentle introduction to Sir Arthur Conan Dole's classic story of Sherlock Holmes. It has action, comedy, good music, and uplifting themes, making it an entertaining movie for kids and watchable enough for parents.Tips for parents: Profanity like ""Cheese & Crackers!"" and ""Fertilizer!""You see quite a bit of a dancing gnome in a thong. If you saw the first Gnomeo & Juliet, you've already been introduced to Mankini, a character kids will laugh at, yet one who is pretty inappropriate for young children, in my opinion. The first Gnomeo & Juliet was rated G, but this one is PG for using some rude and suggestive humor. Mankini's appearances definitely bumped up the rating. There is some potty humor that will make most parents squirm.Some subtitlesAll British accents and landmarks in London.Uplifting theme: ""We all have our good and bad sides."" - Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor)""A man doesn't make you strong, but the right partner can make you stronger."" - Juliet (Emily Blunt)""We took our best friends for granted. We stopped listening. We stopped giving them the respect they deserved. They were the last thing we were thinking about and they should have been the first."" - JulietFamily and friendshipsThings I liked:Star-studded, award-winning voice talents include James McAvoy, Johhny Depp, Michael Caine, Emily Blunt, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Maggie Smith, and Mary J. Blige.The animation is very well done with impressively expressive characters.Lots of physical gags and entertaining visuals.Fun soundtrack of popular hits and new songs.It uses several different types of animation, which I thought was cleverly done.A couple of twists. I love twists.The sound effects were really good, allowing you to hear the clay pots and hear the weight of the gnomes.Stay to the end of the rolling credits to see a few more little things.Kids will like the use of modern technology in the story telling.Things I didn't like:Sherlock Gnomes is pretty annoying and not very likable. If only they had gotten Benedict Cumberbatch to play the voice! He does a fantastic job in the TV adaptation. That would have been awesome and hilarious. Don't get me wrong, because Johnny Depp was fine, but Cumberbatch as Sherlock...come on!There are a lot of jokes that kids simply won't get because they're references to older generations, like the River Dance gag.I started to get bored. It felt like a video I would put on for my kids at home to keep them occupied while I got some work done.Funny lines:""To be fair, it was needlessly complicated, but that's what super villains do."" - Moriarty"
"38",3,"  It was okay, Had a story, unlike some movies that we have seen lately. My 10 yr old liked it"

"40",2.5,"  It's been a couple of hours after watching Sherlock Gnomes and I still have alcohol working through my bloodstream (a byproduct of having to watch Sherlock Gnomes) and so I thought why not begin the review writing process and see where this goes. A little pretext first: I had no intention of watching this movie. Every time its trailer came before a movie I was watching, I cringed harder than I ever have. I cannot remember another movie trailer that I would describe as soul-killing as this one, with its emphasis on butt humor and an extended joke about a thong-wearing gnome farting in the mud. To watch this trailer was to look into the empty abyss and have it look back into you. It was this repulsed reaction that entertained my friend Ben Bailey so much that he insisted that we watch Sherlock Gnomes one fateful evening (he paid for my ticket and my suffering). I loaded up at the theater's bar and the bartender made the easiest upsell he ever did in his life, and I took my tall adult beverage, sat in the theater, and awaited the end, like a man heading toward execution. Then a funny thing happened and Sherlock Gnomes was not the film advertised in its abysmal, life-questioning trailer. It's still not great, though.Following the events from the 2011 original, Gnomeo and Juliet, the garden gnomes have relocated to a new home in London. Gnomeo (voiced by James McAvoy) and Juliet (voiced by Emily Blunt) are entrusted with the gnome-specific responsibilities of the garden by gnome leadership. I guess it's about making the place look nice. Anyway, Sherlock Gnomes (voiced by Johnny Depp) and his trusty sidekick Watson (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor) are looking into the disappearance of gnomes all over. One unfortunate day, while Gnomeo and Juliet are away from their garden, the rest of the gnomes have been kidnapped. Sherlock Gnomes and the others vow to find them, believing the culprit to be Sherlock's longtime nemesis, Moriarty (voiced by Jamie Demetriou).Remarkably, a solid 80 percent of the trailer for Sherlock Gnomes is not in the finished film. The fart Jacuzzi? Gone. The ""no ship Sherlock"" bit? Gone? The thong-wearing gnome twerking? Gone. This fascinates me. We've long been plagued with trailers that ultimately have moments not in the final product, but I've never seen a movie, let alone an animated feature, where the clear majority of its trailer does not exist. Animated films takes many years in development and are generally costly. If a live-action film cuts footage in its final edit, it lost those days of work. If an animated film cuts footage in its final edit, it lost months if possible years of toil. How does this happen? Was the trailer an intentional ruse meant to advertise a far more juvenile, base, and dispiriting movie? The trailer features several jokes or references that, I assumed, were never intended for the final product because these scenes involve the other gnomes who were kidnapped. That means they were animated and either radically changed the story or these jokes were cynically constructed to produce a misleading trailer to appeal t children with farts. This truly fascinates me and befuddles me, a worthy mystery for Sherlock Gnomes.The actual Sherlock Gnomes film I sat through wasn't actively painful but it wasn't particularly engaging or rewarding either, a mediocre children's movie that will vanish from memory upon the ride home. There were a handful of moments where I rolled my eyes but no joke, no pun, even approached the pain of that trailer. On the flip side, there was perhaps two jokes that drew a mild chuckle and that was it. For the majority of the 86-minute running time, I just sat and took it all in, never really engaging. It was boring yet inoffensive, colorful yet unimaginative, and derivative yet silly enough to be a trifle. The look of the animation as a bit more polished than I was anticipating. The use of lighting and scale is well balanced. The voice acting was acceptable from the star-studded cast and I didn't feel any great sadness for anyone's involvement. The lessons and plot twists will be predictable enough for someone over the age of eight, but hey, everybody needs to learn some time. The use of the Elton John song catalogue (he is a primary producer) is the most forced element in the film, elbowing in one song or another, including ""original songs"" that you won't even remember. Much like the rest, John's contributions are mediocre and easily forgotten.I kept wondering about the lazy world building and its implications. This is a clear application of Pixar's oft-used formula of the secret-life-of, this time with garden gnomes. Except there's a segment where Sherlock and Juliet go to a club populated with dolls, stuffed animals, and toys of all sorts. So it's not just garden gnomes that are secretly alive, it's also children's toys. Which means this is essentially the same universe as Toy Story. For whatever reason, and maybe it's a misplaced sense of novelty, we stick with the gnomes. These creatures worry about being smashed, though can they be put back together much like Humpty Dumpty (except he couldn't be put back together even with the help of all the king's men and horses, no never mind this references. Also, what good are horses going to do putting together the shattered pieces of an egg-man? Do horses have thumbs to pick up the broken pieces? I feel like this entire aside might be attributable to the alcohol still in my system). If breaking is their biggest fear, why do these gnomes take such unnecessary risks with their safety and well-being? When Gnomeo is tossing Juliet in the air atop a ladder, I worried for her little gnome life. This cavalier attitude prevails amidst the larger gnome community, and my only conclusion is that these creatures are either thrill-seeking junkies or masochists. Then I began thinking of the life of other garden gnomes. I assume most gnome-owners don't exactly have an entire menagerie of these things, and so the majority of gnome existence must seem awfully isolated and lonely. Their communities must be few and far between. Then I started thinking about transforming past Best Picture-winners into gnome format, and let's just say that 12 Years a Garden Gnome was not a good idea for anyone.This is a sequel and combined spin-off for the animated gnomes world, so the holdover characters often feel superfluous. This is clearly more of a Sherlock vehicle and there are even references to the Hound of Baskervilles and The Final Problem, among others. This is trying to establish a Sherlock Gnomes franchise first and foremost. The Gnomeo and Juliet subplot feels rushed and foolishly resolved. Now tasked with running the garden, Juliet feels overwhelmed with pressure and Gnomeo feels like he isn't getting attention. Rather than support her, or see things from her perspective, he pouts and accuses her of taking him for granted. To conclude this storyline, she actually apologizes, and I shouted, ""Apologize for what?"" A better rendition of this storyline is realized with Sherlock Gnomes repeatedly being indifferent to Watson's contributions. When the main theme, character arcs, and plot points involve new characters, you might as well get rid of the holdovers and go all-in on Sherlock Gnomes. Was there a picky audience that would have said, ""I will only accept another gnome-related children's film if it has the tiniest connection to the last gnome-related children's film""? Also, there's another garden gnome children's film on the horizon, Gnome Alone, so stay tuned, gnome aficionados.The victory is that Sherlock Gnomes is not the seventh-seal-breaking apocalyptic event that its reprehensible, punishing, life-sapping trailer suggested. Hooray for you, Sherlock Gnomes filmmakers. The finished product is still a mostly middling time-waster that feels like a Gnomes relaunch. I fully admit this movie was never intended for someone my age, but I attempted to see its merits for its intended audience. If you have young kids, this is a reasonable 86-minute time waster while you, presumably their parent, can do something, anything better with that time. Go back to that novel you keep pushing off. Have some alone time with yourself or another person. Or simply close your eyes and enjoy the silence. Whatever you do, Sherlock Gnomes is an adequately forgettable comic adventure that will afford you time to think.Nate's Grade: CUPDATE: Thanks to the amazing connectivity of the Internet, someone closely involved with the Sherlock Gnomes production contacted me to inform me that my theory about the trailer discrepancy was correct. Paramount;s marketing team wrote the trailer and insisted the production spend valuable time animating it. The more juvenile jokes were designed, as this source indicated, to put as many butts in the seats opening weekend, and that the marketing department knew best, and that was that. The production spent time creating scenes for a trailer they had no intention of ever being in the finished film, scenes that badly characterized what kind of movie it would be. You can blame Paramount's marketing department for the soul-killing trailer. Thanks, Sherlock Gnomes source, for reaching out and clearing up that mystery."
"41",5,"  If you want to be immediately uplifted, go see this movie with an entire theatre full of children. And listen to the laughter. The movie is adorable and funny and the plot is just complex enough to be stimulating and not silly. Elton John is a worldwide treasure and I thank him heartily for the effervescent joy that I experienced. God bless the child."

"48",5,"  Both my 9 & 11 year old enjoyed the movie very much, and my wife and I was entertained. Great clean humored family film."
"49",3.5,"  It was alright. I felt like this film was a response to BBC in many ways. It took the modern misconception of Holmes being a jerk and portrayed how others around him may react if that was the case, and had him learning a lesson in the end. Watson was done very well, and the film respected that character as having is own skills, abilities and intelligence, which was appreciated and almost makes up for how annoying Holmes was through most of the film.It also did not fall down the common pitfalls of inventing a false relationship between Irene and Sherlock (although I would have liked it more if her husband Godfrey Norton was featured), and tied that encounter with another case from the stories. There were a few other mentions and nods to the stories and other adaptions which was fun to spot. Although it is not on the same kind of level as The Great Mouse Detective, it was still a relatively enjoyable film for what it was."
"50",5,"  i really liked this movie!"
"51",2.5,"  Sherlock Gnomes is a frequently clever animated film that has a few fun moments, yet suffers from a jumbled story and too many characters to fully engage you in the movie as a whole.Sherlock Gnomes is a sequel to Gnomeo and Juliet and brings together garden gnome versions of the famous detective and the Shakespearean couple from the first installment. Gnomeo and Juliet move to a new garden in London that disappoints their entire faction of gnomes. Gnomeo and Juliet are appointed the new leaders to turn the garden into a beautiful wonderland for their little village. Meanwhile, several gardens have been erased of all signs of gnomekind and soon, Gnomeo and Juliet's is too. The dynamic duo of the incredibly smart, but sometimes selfish detective and protector of London's garden gnomes Sherlock Gnomes and his trusty sidekick Watson are on the case and intend to catch the culprit and track down the missing gnomes, with the help of Gnomeo and Juliet.Unfortunately the collision of these literary duos doesn't work very well. Their stories have very different characters and tones. The film makes clever references to Sherlock Holmes and his works that will be enjoyable for fans of the character's inspiration, but the collaboration still feels forced. Gnomeo and Juliet go through a storyline that feels out of place and their conversations have a repetitive message. The characters feel less developed against the more engaging Sherlock. Gnomes.My favorite character is Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp). He embodies the qualities of the literary detective and makes his portrayal of Sherlock his own, giving him a more fun and comedic manner. He also nails Sherlock's complex relationship with Watson.I recommend this film for ages 5 to 9 due to some crude humor. Younger kids will enjoy the film's bright colors and caper elements and older kids and adults might enjoy some of the humor. However, this film lacks the vivid animation and nuance that offers the same wide appeal of other animated films. I give it 2.5 out of 5 stars because the story is a bit confusing, although it has some characters and good laughs. Reviewed by bENJAMIN p. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"55",5,"  Is Gnomeo and Juliet Sherlock Gnomes the worst movie ever made? No. Is the Gnomeo and Juliet Sherlock Gnomes the best movie ever made? Yes. The new installment to the best film franchise has little to no flaws and should be seen by everyone. It is truly an amazing blockbuster film that should be Oscar nominated and Oscar winning. Sherlock Gnomes is a cinematic masterpiece. You need a IQ over 200 to comprehend the genius of this movie. Now critics have been rating this film down, but those are just haters that deserve to be dabbed on to the fullest extent. They are just a bunch of Gnomist! We must stop this gnome racism!! I will stand for a 10/10 movie with no flaws get slaughtered by this Gnome inequality!!! #Gnomelivesmatter #GomeequalityNow the genius of a director, John Stevenson, provides an amazing original story about love, importance of partnership, and the current state of racism in our political news. The surprising plot twist are amazingly surprising and leaves at the edge of your seat the whole movie. And if you are wondering, yes there is at least one dab. Watching that for the first will definitely not make question your life choices and leave you asking yourself, ""What terrible life choices have I committed in my life to be here,"" yeah you won't feel like that. But remember as amazing as this movie is there is one flaw. In the ended the Characters don't fuck. Yes, yet again you will be left with the feeling of what jacksfilms left when he finished watching the emoji movie and I quote ""Blue Balls."" Now I think an appropriate ending to this film would have an ending similar to that of sausage party's. But if you are like me, or any normal person, you had your hand in your pants under your underwear, waiting for that perfect moment to ejaculate, and it never came. You will either have to wait until you get home to finish, or you could do what I did which is finish in the bathroom while the images of the movie are still fresh in your head, because if there is one word I could describe Juliet is THICCC, with 3 c's. That is why you will be left with blue balls. The characters got that junk in the trunk, if you know what I mean hehehe (even the frog). Another complaint, there is no twerking. I mean you give the character that back and you don't even make'em shake'em. But those are just minor flaws that don't really effect the film that much. Another thing that is amazing about the film is the side plot about Benny wanting to bang the frog. It is amazing little love story that I would want to see the abominations that they would call their children. The character development is also an aspect that is handled perfectly. Sherlock Gnomes and Juliet go from being assholes to not assholes. The dialogue is also superb. From the jokes to the serious moments, you will find that the dialogue will always be the most perfect thing to say in that situation. And I will go into a spoiler for a couple of these sentences so I will just say, if you have not watched this masterpiece of a film just skip over this because this film is a must watch. So anyway, there is a tragic and heartbreaking death that will definitely make you cry is you are a decent human being. If you do not cry at this scene you are a soulless and heartless human being that does not cry at all and I want nothing to do with you (asshole) not you only the people that do not cry at this scene. Which will be no one I assure you. Yes Sherlock Gnome's very own assistant Watson does break and it is the saddest moment in film history. This scene is so well done and emotional, because the director and writer does and amazing job at making love and feel for these characters. I know that when I experience this very #emotional scene I was heartbroken and just sobbing. I was crying out loud, could not believe it. That is the only spoiler in this review, I'm sorry I had to spoil that it is just the most emotional experience you will ever get to see.In summary, Sherlock Gnomes is the finest piece of cinema I have seen since Gnomeo & Juliet. It rivals and manages to beat all of Shakespeare's work (including the very play the characters are inspired by ""The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet). It is the definition of what a cinematic masterpiece is and what films should aspire to be."

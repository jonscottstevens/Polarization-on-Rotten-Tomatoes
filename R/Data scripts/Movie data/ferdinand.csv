"1",4,"  Dalle lacrime alle risate a crepapelle... Cartone che rimane nel cuore ??"
"2",3,"  Relatively good movie. The animation and sound was amazing. and it sent a good message to kids that violence is never the answer. Though, as a teenager I didn't enjoy it much. It was overall cheesy and kinda immature in some places. I also personally didn't like how clumsily lucky he was. He should have been dead by the time he got to Nina's farm."
"3",2.5,"  Blue Sky, we need to talk. So based on a children's book from the 1930s, this is about an oversized bull with a gentle heart, Ferdinand (John Cena). All he wants to do is smell the flowers and live with his family in Spain, but it seems that destiny is determined to pull him into the bull fighting life that he has tried so hard to get away from. Now if there is someone out there that can give this movie a fair chance, it's me. I love family oriented animation, and more often than not, I tend to connect with movies of this type to the point of defending them, sometimes undeservedly so. This got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but that's not saying much, as it is no secret that the Academy doesn't take animation seriously (see: The Boss Baby). So how does Ferdinand stack up? Well, I think kids will like it fine, but I can't say that there is really much here for adults. Now to this movie's credit, this actually starts off stronger than I expected. I did sincerely enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes of setup where we learn about Ferdinand's backstory and get introduced to the family that adopts him. It is rare that I can pinpoint when a movie ceases to work, but it is precisely when Kate McKinnon shows up as a comfort goat. I think she is a talented actress, but the only purpose she serves here is just to be the zany sidekick, and they don't have really much of anything written for her to do. It is just a lot of weak sight gags, and none of them really have any payoff. It then starts to become more generic for the following second act... and then something unexpected happens. I do not consider this to be a spoiler because it has absolutely nothing to do with the forward movement of the plot, but right around the hour mark, this turns into Bring It On with no warning or reason. I mean really, all of these bulls have a dance off against these three horses that inexplicably have German accents, and it ends up being highly surreal and out of place. I don't think Cena does badly with his voice acting, but I do think he still has a ways to go before he reaches the status that Dwayne Johnson is currently at. I liked Ferdinand as a character as well, as he is basically like a giant dog who doesn't know his own size, but all of the side characters got on my nerves as time went on. It's watchable, but it is just very DreamWorks, if you follow me. I would say show it to your kids, but then again, kids have no idea who this character is, so they probably won't be excited for this. If this didn't get lazy after the first act, I might have been able to give this a low recommendation, but as it stands, it ends up being a bit of a misfire."
"4",3,"  So they don't dance around the fact that the bulls die when they face the matador. It's actually a pretty dark premise for a kids' movie. I had a few laughs, but I won't be seeing this one again anytime soon."
"5",4.5,"  Not bad film I like it. Ferdinand is a fun and good family film I ever watch with very good visuals and very well done likable characters but the thing is about this film is that its a fun film but it did not have the charm and the heart warming feeling that coco has plus the animation is good but not beautiful and artistic like coco has but you know what I have fun and this was a fun film to watch. Overall Ferdinand is a fun film for the whole family to watch even though it did not have the charm and the heart warming feeling that coco had but it was a well done animated family fun film that i enjoy it and have fun watching it. Well done Blue Sky Studios you guys made a well done and fun family animated film and I like and plus bulls are awesome and kind. good job and well done."
"6",1,"  The movie tried to do too much and should have stuck more with the original story. It's filler in trying to make it movie length was forgettable and at times exhausting."
"7",3.5,"  In a desperate attempt to escape the life of a fighting bull, Ferdinand (John Cena) escapes to a life of smelling flowers and relaxing in a peaceful farm. However, when he ends up back at his old home after being mistaken for a fierce bull, it's up to Ferdinand and an optimistic goat (Kate McKinnon) to convince the other bulls of the possibilities of a better life beyond the arena...As with most short children's books that are expanded to feature length narratives such as The Polar Express, The Grinch and The Lorax, Blue Sky Studios's adaptation of Munro Leaf's 1936 children's book, The Story of Ferdinand does tend to drag out it's narrative with annoying slapstick and pointless subplots.However, the beautiful background animation of Spain, John Cena's suprisingly good voice acting and the heart of the source material remaining intact, does make this film a lot more tolerable than those films and much like 2015's excellent adaptation of Peanuts, it proves that Blue Sky Studios is capable of producing quality work that isn't Ice Age related.Overall, Ferdinand is a cute little animal flick that doesn't offer much surprises, but has it's heart in the right place and is mostly harmless family fun."
"8",3,"  From Mexico to Spain, this year is very internationalFERDINAND Looking back, this year hasn't been the greatest when it comes to the animation genre. Apart from the obvious Pixar's masterpiece Coco, there haven't been any standouts that demanded a second watching from me. I haven't watched The Breadwinner yet but how does Ferdinand and The Boss Baby get to be considered two of the five best movies of the year? I miss Ghibli's annual nomination which, like, Pixar used to give us consistent masterful works every single year. And it's not that Ferdinand is bad but it's certainly no more than mediocre. It's a movie with the complexity of, for example, Rio which was no wonder either. And although the main character is immensely lovable, he's surrounded by archetypes who don't get to further themselves. Even the script denies itself the opportunity to delve in its heaviest themes, as it dodges every opportunity of a strong emotional punch in order not to scar young audiences. You know, kids are progressively less impressionable and sure, cohesive and straight-forward storytelling will cut it for them but it will not, however, be enough for us. There would be so much potential to send an anti bullfighting message with this film but it shies away from that. Ferdinand is, for the lack of a better word, a breeze. You are mildly entertained and then it ends. Its greatest flaw may be the lack of what true filmmaking has to spare: subtext. And that means the difference between breaking a china shop and grabbing the bull by the horns"
"9",3,"  sweet but a little slow in some parts"
"10",4.5,"  Imaginative, gorgeously animated, and very original."
"11",5,"  this was a very cute movie!"
"12",4,"  Good movie with funny characters"
"13",2.5,"  A cute story, with a cute message that is nice to watch. The dialogue isn't over done, but I wasn't crazy about most of the voice actors. I'll tell you what, I can watch and laugh at those horse all day though."
"14",3,"  Am I the only one who takes issue with a bull and a child, living in Spain, that speak with an American accent?"
"15",5,"  Was funny movies great for kids"
"16",4,"  Charming. I took our grandson."
"17",3,"  I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, the second one, not so much."
"18",4.5,"  This is really good movie! Ferdinand is very cool bull"
"19",3,"  As entertaining as a kids movie about an animal bloodsport can be.This one definitely will not be remembered for its depth or animation, but kids will enjoy it and you'll find it on repeat in many homes for the next few years.Cena does a great job, and there's a fun character voiced by Peyton Manning. This was a pleasant surprise and I'd recommend it as an enjoyable time waster."
"20",1,"  Really awful.How many scenes do we need at a CHOP house?On and on I could go about how this was a poor choice to make into a film..bullfighting, such child friendly subject matter."
"21",5,"  This was a very good movie. But I am not sure for kids really though."
"22",5,"  I felt that it would have be hard to make a movie from a child very pleased with the end results. The animat lthevion was great and it the other characters were great. was easy to cheer for Ferdinand. I would recommend it."
"23",4,"  The voice acting isnt strong, but the story, tempo and soundtrack makes for an entertaining family movie."
"24",4,"  Original, wacky, funny and very entertaining."
"25",5,"  Perfect family movie"
"26",4,"  Funny story which I loved."
"27",0.5,"  Fatally flawed from the point of conception. Tries to squeeze out a children's comedy-adventure from a brutal and sadistic reality."
"28",2,"  Another formulaic animation by Carlos Saldanha, who tries too hard to make something fun for the whole family but doesn't seem to realize how forgettable this is, with silly German horses, endless chases and pedestrian jokes that rely mostly on Ferdinand being big and clumsy."
"29",4,"  good for kids and parents very heart warming lovely soft story for a sunday afternoon"
"30",2.5,"  Ferdinand is such a disappointing movie which is very well animated and it has some sweet and fun scenes, but for the most part it is filled with way too much action scenes and too many sidekick characters. It is frenetic, boring and way too kid friendly. Needless to say, its Oscar nomination is ludicrous and the original 1938 Disney short remains the quintessential adaptation of this story."
"31",4,"  Really Great My Kids Loved It So Much"
"32",5,"  Ferdinand is a masterful movie. Comparing it to the Disney short is like comparing apples and oranges. It is a powerful story about a bull who didn't want to fight, but instead smell the flowers and have friends. The ending has ferdinand showing mercy, which was the only way to survive the bullring. I would see it again and again and not get tired of it."
"33",2.5,"  A safe middle of the road children's movie that doesn't do anything overly stupid or offensive but also doesn't take any risks to making anything unique and in typical blue sky animation fashion is filled with load annoying characters and is filled with an annoyingly fast pace that assumes children have zero patience"
"34",2.5,"  The bull in a china shop section is great. Unfortunately, they've stretched out that decent Pixar short to over 90 minutes, and there's just not much left there. Animals behave like humans and do non-animal activities. That's basically the extent of the humor. Sure, it's heart is in the right place, but the ""be yourself"" message is a bit cliché for a kids film. 2017 just wasn't a great year for animated or kids films."
"35",5,"  I don't know Why do tears come out of my eyes when watching THIS movie. .????????"
"36",3.5,"  Surprisingly heartfelt and fun--don't miss the dance-off in the middle!"
"37",1,"  So much of this movie is racist like The accents, and um,well,it's just garbage"
"38",3.5,"  A dark story if you're a kid, an animal lover or a bull. If you and your kids aren't sensitive to the bulls going in and the horns come out on a plaque, then it's enjoyable. An original animated story about self acceptance and not giving up on yourself or those around you."
"39",2.5,"  Yeah well, I wasn't expecting much but still.. I mean there were a few smiles but no actual laughs and even though the characters were sweet, the whole wasn't fun."
"40",4,"  Beautifully animated, Ferdinand is a tradicional animation, if not bring nothing new to the table, still is a great product, full of heart, lessons and a lot of charismatic characters. Carlos Saldanha provide a entertaining and solid movie for the whole family. (4/5)"
"41",0.5,"  This movie was so generic and basic. Totally butchered the massage"
"42",5,"  If you are interested on teaching your kid to be itself and not always follow what the rest say, this is the perfect movie to watch. Ferdinand, besides its beautiful scenes and amazing explanation of Spain traditions, it presents a unique concept that it is not often mentioned. As competitive human beings, we usually try to do a better job than anyone else on Earth no matter the situation. Unfortunately, the way we do things is not usually special and we tend to follow a common procedure on how to be successful. Meanwhile, Ferdinand teaches as that by following our own way of being, we can reach all the goals we set in our mind and make them reality."
"43",5,"  The ""Spirit"" of the second decade of the 21st century (Spirit: Stallion of the cimarron, the movie). It is lovely, it made me tear up at the end."
"44",3.5,"  Charming, often quite funny, and fairly old-fashioned (though not in an unwelcome manner). Surprisingly for a modern animated kids movie, it's also not afraid to actually have the darkness of the real-world in it overtly as central to the latter parts of the story (albeit in fairly typically light fashion, but still, it's there)."
"45",3,"  The youngest in the house enjoyed it. Overall, a bit clunky, and the voice work wasn't great, but not a terrible way to spend some time with the youngster."
"46",4,"  With a good enough story about how violence is not the solution to all problems, this is enjoyable enough. It's not on par with Pixar but it's one of the best of late for Blue Sky."
"47",5,"  Loved it. Doesn't matter no one else did. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely not a child's movie and I'm totally against bullfighting, and wonder who on earth came up the the thought to use it in an animation. All in all though thankfully, a happy ending unlike real bull torture."
"48",1,"  A hopelessly lacklustre animation from Blue Sky Studios, the company responsible for a long line of increasingly poor Ice Age sequels, I'm not even sure it's supposed to be funny, since huge chunks of time pass by without even as much as a smile being raised. Almost every joke is a running gag which started out not being funny and then proceeds to be run into the ground. The obligatory quirky sidekick is little more than a repetitive annoyance, most of the characters are cheap stereotypes, the ending can be guessed within minutes, and the film breaks out its dance montage within 20 minutes. John Cena does his best, but he's playing the lead character who wants to do their own thing despite everyone else telling them to conform, which seems to be the default status for every children's film protagonist, and it does absolutely nothing new with this premise. It's a sad indicator of the state of animated films that this gets an Academy Award nomination and The Lego Batman Movie doesn't."
"49",3,"  At least it's better than The Boss Baby + The anti-animal cruelty message represented very well from the perspective of the bulls and also merged very well with the message of individuality.+ The animation is simple yet very beautiful, and the human characters' designs are really something special; every single human character design is different from the other and also very suitable for their Spanish nationality+ John Cena did a great job voicing the titular character, I mean who could be better than him voicing a strong bull with a big heart?+ ""Home"" is really a very good song and surprisingly moving!+ The final bullfighting scene is very well directed.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The humor is really really bad in this movie and 99% of the joke didn't work for me. Every bad joke you could imagine is in this movie; they are very silly, they are clichéd and they are so long that make you bored!- There are a lot of useless characters who are often supposed to be funny (okay, maybe the hedgehogs weren't that bad), and their introduction seemed like short films not just because they are long scenes but also very bad edited.- Unexpectedly, the relationship between the little girl and Ferdinand seemed to be forced to the movie. I really think it's not that important to the story, and the movie itself didn't care so much about it; it didn't give it a lot of time to be emerged or to be felt throughout the movie."
"50",1.5,"  I have no idea who decided it was a good idea to make a kids movie about bull fighting. The characters are generic and boring with no redeeming qualities. The movie was cute and decent until Kate McKinnons character, the most annoying ""side kick"" character ever, made the movie almost unbearable. Then throw in the German horses that only speak in memes and 10 year old slang, and you realize Fox animation was never going to learn from Disney to make their animated movies actually bearable for the parents being dragged into it. They can't even copy Pixars generic plot without screwing that up. Glad Disney bought them out. Maybe they'll clean house and make something watchable.The only positive I can give this movie is John Cena's voice acting is great and I hope he does many more films."
"51",5,"  Loved it~ cried alittle."
"52",2,"  Prefer the animated short Ferdinand the Bull."
"53",2.5,"  Not all that interesting, but the animation is nice."
"54",2,"  it's about time we meet again..FerdinandThe animated features are supposed to attract the viewers into their new and attention seeking world and to be rich in details which helps connecting to them, unfortunately none of it is offered in here. Just a mere idea is projected by Carlos Saldanha; the director, which already was present in the original book and addition to that, it fails on delivering what was already there too. John Cena at the centre of it, is quite convincing but in here Kate McKinnon steals the show as her character is strong too along with her work. Ferdinand is a forward pass in its first act and a complete downer on its second one where all the clichÃ©d characters and sequences jumps in that awaits and predicts the last act that even though being exhilarating (the chase scene is the only high point of the feature) couldn't charm anyone."
"55",5,"  Best animated film of 2017"
"56",2.5,"  Comedy of situations with ridiculous arguments inside an un-realistic version of the world it wants to represent. A sad attempt to represent the animal drama related to bullfighting."
"57",4,"  Aided by hilarious and comedic voice performances from John Cena and Kate McKinnon, Ferdinand is a funny, light-hearted family film for all ages and brings a dominantly colorful story to life."
"58",3.5,"  They had a scene where one of the bulls was taken to the slaughterhouse, but then they retconned it, which took some of the feel away from the situation...the Home scene made me feel things, though - it was really cool."
"59",5,"  GREAT MOVIE! GREAT STORY! THE WORLD NEEDS MORE LIKE THIS!!"
"60",2.5,"  It had some beautiful animation, and some funny slapstick moments. But the screenplay seemed like a rough draft. It really dragged and had me looking at my watch."
"61",3.5,"  It can't go to toe-to-toe with Coco for the animation Oscar, but Ferdinand represents a step forward in quality for Blue Sky Studios. They've managed to infuse their usual brand of frenetic storytelling and frantic humor with a nice adherence to the source material. It a shiny piece of animation for modern day families but telling a timely and poignant story that culminates in a touching match in the arena. This is predictable fluff, but actually hilarious, the German stallions had me guffawing, and John Cena and Kate McKinnon do great vocal work. What I think would improve Blue Sky's efforts on a more technical level, would be the fleshing out of the backgrounds and a more unique visual style. The animation is nice but very basic and not filled in as much as one would expect from Pixar. Still, Ferdinand is often too frantic, but its message is strong and its a pleasant way to spend an afternoon at the movies. In a year with few good animation offerings, this one at least ended the year stronger. Rating: 72"
"62",3,"  Okay. Not great. Marginally entertaining."
"63",5,"  Wonderful, movie full of joy and fiendship. Every child should see this!"
"64",1.5,"  The voiceover work is good, with John Cena turning in a decent performance as a the gentle giant. And unlike The Emoji Movie before it, Ferdinand actually has a bit of heart to it. Unfortunately, the film's scenes are cobbled together and copied from other, better adventures. The pacifist message of the movie is not exactly new, but it feels especially out-of-place in the violent world of bullfighting. It's very similar to the theme of 1998's Pokemon: The First Movie, and like that movie, the message is meaningless once the movie ends, because we all know that the pacifism does nothing for the world of the movie."
"65",5,"  My kids loved it. Went to the theater twice."
"66",4,"  Great story! My son is 4.5 and he really enjoyed it. Lots of laugh out loud moments for parents and kids alike."
"67",4,"  Thought the movie had a good message that was delivered properly. Was very happy my kids got to see it."
"68",5,"  Such a lovely movie!! My daughter and son absolutely loved it! Very kind and interesting story. The only problem is, my daughter is crying and asking me to buy her a bull... with the broken horn... :) not sure how long she would remember it"
"69",1.5,"  What this movie had in beautiful animation it lost in the story. A kids movie that was at times too dark for kids, making it a movie for nobody."
"70",2,"  Formulaic animated fable that is pleasant enough but doesnt really do anything special."
"71",2,"  A powerful beginning, a gorgeous ending, and in between, a meaningless slog of ""kooky"" slapstick and brown characters being slapped around. But the pro-bullfighting crowd apparently loathes it, so there's that."
"72",4.5,"  I ended up having to see this movie twice and I honestly didn't mind. I don't normally watch animated movies but this was pretty cute. It had a good story line and some pretty funny parts. I would watch it again if someone wanted to."
"73",2.5,"  Puntaje Original: 5.5Con ciertos elementos remarcables en su trama y algunos momentos hilarantes, Ferdinand es un film simple, predecible y con un mensaje demasiado obvio."
"74",3,"  Funny movie and family friendly"
"75",3,"  Nice family film, kinda got lost in the shadow of Coco. Big shout out to John Cena & Kate McKinnon for their voice work."
"76",3.5,"  Kids liked it but Mom thought it was a bit long."
"77",2,"  I loved Ferdinand as a child and Ferdinand himself looks good here. But. This is a former children's story turned into an ""action thriller"" with the accompanying meanness and inflated villainy that seems to require. Not for kids, not for girls, and really, not for boys either. There is nothing ""family-friendly"" about actual bull fighting."
"78",5,"  Terrific! What a great story and wonderful characters, just can't beat this one. You'll fall in love with Ferdinand, a classic in every way. Loved every minute!"
"79",3,"  Coco - Sing - Bambi - Cars 3 - The Secret Life of Pets"
"80",5,"  Great movie. My daughter loved it."
"81",5,"  Go watch Ferdinand guyss its good I swear"
"82",3.5,"  Ferdinand is exactly as adorable as you thought it was going to be. A sweet movie with a good message, a few laughs and some beautiful artwork. A little more tinkering would have improved it but what we ended up getting was pretty damn spectacular."
"83",3,"  not a bad film but the standards are so high thanks to Pixar that this film feels like a straight to DVD film but kids will enjoy it"
"84",4,"  Really good. A sort of suprise too."
"85",5,"  Great movie for kids and adults. It had a great storyline and had great humor in it!"
"86",5,"  It is a beautiful film from which we can learn different things including not giving up our dreams"
"87",5,"  This movie is surprising entertaining. A lot of memorable characters including machina, bones, guapo and others. Its definitely a must see if you are with the family or just single and want to be entertained."
"88",1.5,"  Yawn! Wasn't awful. Just, eh. Never got me remotely interested in the characters."
"89",3.5,"  The sort of movie Disney used to make before it decided it liked cash more than kids. It follows a well worn path but has enough sparkle and irreverence to keep it fresh. Released the same time as the latest Star Wars bore fest it does the opposite and pleases more than you expected it to rather than leaves you feeling like you've just been mugged."
"90",4.5,"  I really enjoyed this movie with my children. I found myself smiling the whole way through. My kids were completely engrossed. Ages 5 and 9."
"91",5,"  GREAT movie - very funny - and poignant. Well acted and beautiful to look at."
"92",4,"  These people are crazy. great movie. lots of laughs"
"93",1.5,"  Ferdinand is chock full of annoying characters, flaws in the plotline and a happy ending."
"94",5,"  I'm from Seville, Spain and all of you can not possible begin to understand how needed it is this movie for our actual society. It's a great movie with a great message, it's not only about peace and freedom, it's about animal rights and how we use them as items. The book from where the movie is based on was banned in Spain during the francoist era for their ""depraved"" message, still a lot of work to do here in my land and the world, these kind of movies for kids and adults are so need for the future. It amazes me in a really bad way how the movie is not getting the importance that it deserves. Actual society is not ready for these kind of messages but I'm totally sure that in the future and I want to believe it, the society will be better and take this movie as referent. Totally recommended. Same happened with The Book of Life of Jorge R. Gutierrez.Saludos desde Sevilla, y liberación animal, por favor mÃ¡s que pelÃ­culas asÃ­ para los niÃ±os y para los mayores, sobre todo para los mayores."
"95",5,"  Went to see this movie with my 4 year old grandson after taking him to see Coco. BOTH are great movies. BOTH are suitable for young children and have good moral values. I suspect Ferdinand is rated lower because of its ""pacifist"" bent. It seems these days that there is not even a debate about all the violence in which our government engages around the world in OUR names. Ferdinand is a bull who does not want to fight. He loves flowers and everything beautiful about the world. He is a ""flower child"" so to speak even though he is the biggest and strongest bull. When he has a chance to get the upper hand against the ""evil"" bullfighter, he just sits down and engages his eyes. As a 69 year old survivor of the Vietnam era, I loved this movie and its morality. My grandson was very tired but it held his attention throughout. And it certainly held mine. If you liked Coco, you will like Ferdinand."
"96",4.5,"  It was a fun, hilarious animated movie. I just thought it was good, but my dad said it could have been better or worse. I thought the humor was great, so go ahead and see it if you haven't already and think about how you feel for Ferdinand."
"97",3.5,"  Though ""Ferdinand' is predictable and thinly plotted, it's still a funny and heartfelt animated film that benefits from the charming voice performances from John Cena and Kate McKinnon."
"98",4,"  While this movie does have a good amount of great comedy, it also has a good amount of great heart. Through Ferdinand's journey back home, the audience sees how his selflessness and good personality changes those he meets. From the companions he had as a young calf, to the new friends he makes on the way, even to the climatic bullfight in Madrid, the gentle giant inspires and changes everyone's views of him by being himself. John Cena did a fantastic job as the title bull as did the rest of the cast. The animation is excellent, especially in the comedic chase sequence near the end of the film. This is a great family movie, and I will definitely be buying this on Blu-ray when it comes out. 8/10"
"99",4,"  I'm surprised by all the negative reviews! I love kids movies and thought this one was very cute. Definitely not my favorite/not on par with Pixar movies, but a good story (although predictable) and funny."
"100",1,"  A shitty painfully unfunny film with a extremely predictable story."
"101",4,"  Surprisingly funny and refreshing"
"102",5,"  Screw the critics! This movie was great."
"103",3.5,"  Ferdinand is a bull's hit. Movie has a simple story about a big big bull with kind heart. It is really simple and straight forward for kids to understand and enjoy Ferdinand. John Cena is already loved by kids and they are gonna love his voice as lead character. Animation team has kept this in basic 3D and not the realistic animation that makes it looks good. The sequence in the grocery store and the market will bring smile on your face. The sequence with the rabbit, the Hedgehogs are good to watch and viewers will appreciate dance competition between horses and the bulls. They were cool. Ferdinand is a good animation movie and will be appreciated by viewers. One can say it is a lite entertaining movie with moral. One can appreciate the Spanish city themes and the Spanish music running in background too."
"104",5,"  This movie is quite cute. I have to say the ticket is worthy."
"105",5,"  Una película con un gran mensaje, junto con COCO una de las mejores que he visto."
"106",5,"  I'm surprised how badly rated it is. It was actually a very good animation. It teaches kids about compassion and about being kind. Also it's funny but also a tear jerker. Great show! Makes me not wanna eat meat though (:"
"107",4,"  great movie with interesting cast voice Ã°???Ã°???"
"108",4,"  Kate Mckinnon almost ruined this sweet heart warming movie. Her character was completely obnoxious... kinda like her in real life."
"109",3,"  Ferdinand has its cute and charming moments on top of having some good animation and successfully capturing the heart and soul of its source material by keeping the message from the book, but the big problem that keeps this movie from being great is that it feels really drawn out and slow paced at times. Not to mention that the comic reliefs are really annoying. I think if they removed the comedic sidekicks, and focused only on the bulls and humans, this movie would have been so much better. But as it is, it's OK. Nothing to really rush to, but it's relatively harmless."
"110",4,"  It was a fun movie, my wife and I liked it."
"111",3,"  It took me half an hour, but eventually Ferdinand won me over. My 3 year old got bored, but my 5 year old enjoyed it.The humor takes a while to get going, but there are some laughs.The horses were great.I think Ferdinand?s strength lies at its heart. It does give you the warm fuzzies and leaves you smiling.These movies are a dime a dozen these days. A few a great, many fall short..... Ferdinand is somewhere in the middle.Good and worth a look."
"112",1.5,"  My 7 year old daughter loved it. I would rather have gone to the dentist. Definitely NOT certified fresh."
"113",5,"  I really enjoyed this film. I don't particularly understand all the audience hate for this film. There were some real shining moments in this film and the 4 kids that I took to see this film liked it better than Coco (I did too). The characters were loveable and the story endearing. I have a feeling your kids will absolutely love this movie even if you are a bit on the fence about it. And lets be honest, you are not going out of your way to watch animated films for yourself as there are much more entertaining films for adults in the world."
"114",3,"  It's a kids movie that has nice characters and a story of difference being a strength when we work together. Being true to yourself is what makes you successful and who wouldn't want their children to leave with that thought."
"115",5,"  Best animation of the year. Not a new story but one with real heart. Many will overlook this sweet story that has a wonderful message especially in this challenging time.A real winner!"
"116",4,"  A sweet and very underrated that should be watched with the whole family."
"117",2,"  Es una historia que enmascara una exaltaciÃ³n de la tauromaquia. Trama forzada, con chistes tontos y personajes fÃ¡cilmente olvidables."
"118",4,"  Read the books as a child.. this movie hit a nice soft fuzzy fealing in my heart..!! Funny adorable!! And yes it made me cry!! Worthy of a second and third watching!!"
"119",0.5,"  I could have written a better movie. A mindless way to screw up a time honored classic story...,"
"120",3,"  First movie of 2018. It was pretty good. Now I have to go find the old cartoon from my childhood."
"121",3.5,"  Certainly not the ""quickest"" animated feature, this still carries a barn load of sweetness and carries some of the most beautiful scenery work I've seen in animation. Carried a distinctly European feel, set in Spain, so that makes sense!"
"122",4,"  its a fun movie to watch with the famliy"
"123",4.5,"  Great family movie. So many applicable life lessons while remaining entertaining. My daughter loved this as much as I did. Can't to see it again with my son. Just wish there were more Hispanic voices in the lead roles."
"124",3,"  I watched it once at the cinema last month, and found it un-BULL-ievable.There were moments that I didn't quite expect, including plenty of funny and enjoyable moments. But really, I kind of find it too sad and awkward for teenagers. So what I'm saying is that it's good but not great. If you're planning on watching Ferdinand, don't expect it to be an awesome type of film."
"125",3,"  I don't really like bulls that are gentle, melancholy, and nonchalant. He's fat, too, and probably not a strong animal. The horses played by Germans and the skinny, prestigious, strict, fancy, little bull seeker El Primero made the show worth something, to me."
"126",4,"  Great Movie. Very enjoyable. Walked away with a huge smile on my face"
"127",5,"  This is a great movie based on a book from the 1930's. The kids liked it."
"128",3,"  Great animation one of the best I?ve seen looked like puppets at times, good meaning in story and trying to go against meat.Some characters like the goat and hedgehogs was very weak and brought this movie down"
"129",5,"  watch ferdinand guysss its so good for children and adults"
"130",3,"  not sure why the user score is so low, it was pretty good. John Cena was a miscast."
"131",5,"  I loved Ferdinand, a story about swimming against the current and refusing to be forced into behaving against his values.I am sure the meat industry will try to out this movie but it speaks volumes of truth, love and inner strength!!This movie is done with a lot of humor and cleverness!!"
"132",2,"  it was ok, started out good and had its share of funny moments but ultimately turned into a lib-tard shit show pushing liberal agenda."
"133",0.5,"  Really is not the film that will make you reflect, the environments aren't so realistic like other animated films and is a basic and boring story"
"134",2,"  I remember reading ""The Story of Ferdinand"" when I was a kid and enjoying it. Me remembering the story which is the basis for this movie (And also having a free pass and a coupon for a free popcorn.) motivated me to see this movie. While it is tough to expand a short children's book into a full length movie, I found myself not all that impressed with this movie. It is not terrible by any means, but it is just dull, formulaic and for the most part forgettable. The whole scene of Ferdinand and the bulls escaping in the trailer was recycled right out of ""Finding Dory"". There were also come comedic moments that were just as unoriginal. There are a few laughs here and there, but overall ""Ferdinand"" is just another by the numbers animated film. Unlike Pixar's ""Coco"" there is nothing here that makes this movie unique."
"135",3,"  Ferdinand was a decent movie, 2017 hasn't been a good year for animated movies, some movies were great like Cars 3, the Lego Batman movie etc, but there have been some bad ones like the Star and the Emoji Movie, but there were some movies that were just decent, and Ferdinand is one of those movies. Created by the same people who worked on movies like Ice Age, Rio and the 2015 Peanuts Charlie Brown movie being the studio Blue Sky, Ferdinand is what I consider one of their more mature movies seeing as it isn't another Ice Age sequel, although it isn't as mature as the Peanuts movie, but I would say this movie is more mature than any of Blue Sky's other movies.This movie has a decent story but it can be predictable at times, the cast is pretty good, the characters are somewhat likable, the music is pretty good, the animation is great, but unfortunately none of the jokes were funny.I'd say this movie falls under the category of it had good potential but it didn't live up to what it should've been, would I recommend this? Well, yes and no, it really depends on if you're interested in watching it, if you are than I'd say give it at least one viewing to make up your mind, but if you're not than it's okay to skip this one.I give Ferdinand a 6 out of 10 it could've been great, but it fell flat on its face."
"136",0.5,"  A lot of things felt off, didn't have the same magic as the book"
"137",5,"  Sweet movie with a great love versus hate (or war versus peace) message as well as loyalty/friendship message."
"138",2,"  Cute but very much a child's movie, as in nothing that would interest an adult"
"139",5,"  deffo worth watching for everyone"
"140",4.5,"  Absolutely lovely. A great story that stays true to the message of the book. So many classics have been made into mediocre movies, but this one really stood up. I'm amazed the audience score is so low. I highly recommend this movie for children of all ages."
"141",5,"  as good as coco watch it with kids"
"142",5,"  Loved it! Haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Also made me want to visit Spain."
"143",1.5,"  Blue Sky Animation is the home of the truly mediocre in modern animation. The house that the awful Ice Age movies built is back again and apparently attempting to hide their latest bit of sub-par animation by opening Ferdinand opposite Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Smart move, Blue Sky. Burying Ferdinand is definitely the right call. No, the movie isn't terrible, it's just mediocre. And in a world where Pixar still rules, it's not a bad idea to drop your more modestly ambitious products where few audiences will see it. https://geeks.media/movie-review-ferdinand?_ga=2.260866509.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710"
"144",0.5,"  Ferdinand was a waste of time. The only moment of it I enjoyed was the bull/goat/horse dance battle. It is unrealistic and too intense for younger kids. Not intense enough for PG13, but too intense for regular PG. I recommend finding another movie to watch. Ferdinand is too much."
"145",3.5,"  Cute for a kids movie, would recommend for families."
"146",3.5,"  MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT Over The Godawful Ice Age: Collision CourseI'm Proud Of You Blue Sky! :)"
"147",3,"  This movie is cheesy, but fun. It is a kids movie primarily and it shows. Decent film overall, the mannerisms of the animals is captured well by the animators. Perfect for a fun casual family movie that has it's moments."
"148",4,"  Saw it tonight with our young daughters (6 and 10) and we all thought it was super cute!! Two thumbs up I felt compelled to leave a review because it's usually the critics who get it wrong, but this time it's the audience rating here which is very low and I disagree with it. Some of the negative reviews seemed somewhat suspect, so I chose to ignore them and glad we did. Also, this is a good kid movie for kids of all ages and for that reason, it trumps Coco (which I really liked but it was somewhat scary to my 6 yr old). Enjoy the movie!"
"149",5,"  great film for kids better than coco"
"150",4.5,"  Clash of the titanic bulls overcome by gentle kindness. A tale of adventure and hilarity... especially the equine dancefight."
"151",3,"  Taking an 80 year old Children's book that can be read in 5 minutes and expanding it into an hour and 40 minutes is no easy feat. Ferdinand delivers with something for viewers of every age. With an unexpected ending that makes you want to both laugh and cry, this movie does not disappoint. The run time is a little long for the younger set (kids 3 and under) and the use of the word ""butt"" is rampant throughout the picture, ""but"" overall...a great little family film."
"152",5,"  I loved it. My daughter's loved it. We will see it again."
"153",4,"  Go see it, it's absolutely charming and heartwarming"
"154",5,"  Ferdinand is a sweet, heartwarming, and charming family film. It's way better than Star Wars. Go see Ferdinand, you'll love it."
"155",5,"  Are all the people intentionally avoiding to mention the fact that these bloody stupid bullfights are still happening in Spain??? It's like discussing ""Django unchained"" in the 18th century America... Elephant is in the room, but let's talk about the weather outside."
"156",5,"  gooooooooo watch ferdianand its great for kids and adults"
"157",5,"  better than coco for sure"
"158",5,"  My kids and I loved this movie!!! Super cuter and fun for the whole family. We couldn't stop laughing, this is a must see in my book!!"
"159",3.5,"  Great voice acting throughout. Lots of laughs."
"160",2.5,"  Took my 3 yo to see it, and 3/4 way through she said she did not like this movie. I found it hard to stick with young audiences. Most parents I spoke too who took their kids there did not like it. It was alright in my opinion, nothing great."
"161",3,"  An animated film with a message that sometimes gets lost in the cartoon silliness."
"162",3.5,"  It's decent. Nothing great, nothing bad. There is a lot of filler, especially in the first half of the movie, but the second half is exciting and funny. It's not a movie that is really trying to speak to adults and doesn't have much depth. There are many bland characters but some are memorable as well. Even though the main character Ferdinand and the little girl Nina are a little bland, the friendship bond between them feels believeable. Most of the comedy comes from the animation and the pacing and it works well enough for some parts while other scenes just drag. One part that really annoyed me were the constant butt jokes in the first half of the movie but they (fortunately) stopped making those in the second half. The plot is predictable for the most parts but there are little twists at some point. If you know the book the movie is based on, you realize that the writers were trying to expand on the original story and it mostly works. There are also some little scenes that got unexpectly dark. The message doesn't feel forced and the narrative improves as the film goes on. The animation looks good for the most part except for inconsistency in the character designs. Some of the characters are trying to look very realistic (some of the bulls, some of the humans, the horses) while others are way too cartoony and don't blend well with the other characters (the other bulls, the hedgehogs, the goat, the bunny...). The soundtrack is a mix between some generic pop songs and some spanish music which can be a little distracting sometimes. Spanish culture is decently portrayed even though it relies a little bit too much on stereotypes - but there's nothing offensive about it.In conclusion: Ferdinand doesn't really do anything groundbreaking and it is surely not the childrens movie of the year but you can tell that the producers were not trying to accomplish that. Their main goal was just to make some children laugh and they really reached that goal. So despite some stupid moments and some bad jokes, Ferdinand is a enjoyable adventure for the whole family."
"163",4.5,"  I and my family loved Ferdinand. My grandson was enamored with it. It is about a bull who doesn't want to fight. However, his pacifistic nature eventually wins out and provides great moral values to the other more violent bulls but also to the audience. Honestly, for kids, this is a great must see movie. Don't believe the negative reviews. It really was very good for kids and we adults liked it too."
"164",5,"  Fantastic movie! Best kids movie in a while!"
"165",4,"  Very funny charming film"
"166",5,"  Excellent development of the short shot made many decades ago. I consider myself lucky to have seen it, after having seen the frst one in the 80's. A wonderful tribute of how to avoid being a bully when everyone goads you to it, in this day and age, this is a rare discourse. Quite creative especially in its denouement, hilarious in many ways, great fun... and I can't wait opionions from the spaniards too. Have seen it with my whole family and children (4 and 11) - the younger one was somewhat discomforted at some more tense moments, but otherwise I recommend it as parent as must see. It's beautiful, hilarious, and educational. As stories should be."

"168",1.5,"  God was this hard to get through. Not a bad message, but a cliched one. That's the biggest takeaway. It was cliched slop that wasn't funny and not imaginative. Not impressed and it felt like a straight to DVD film. Skip it.3/10E"
"169",3,"  John Cena charms as the gentle giant who prefers to stop and smell the flowers versus fighting and Kate McKinnon steals the show as Lupe, the calming goat. The film can't compete with the emotional resonance or technical achievement of Disney / Pixar's COCO, but the sweet story and timeless message of ""being who you were born to be"" makes this animated adventure worth the trip."
"170",4.5,"  Really enjoyed this. The goat makes the film. Lots of laughing out loud. Would recommend"
"171",3.5,"  A movie that does what it needs to do so you can enjoy it. Took my six year old nephew, have read him the book many times over the year. He really enjoyed it. The dance off scene between the horses and the bulls had him jumping and jamming along with the action on the screen.  There is nothing earth shattering about this movie but it hits enough boxes to explain why decades after it was published the story is still being enjoyed by young and old both."
"172",3,"  My three year old loved it! I thought the opening was slow, but things picked up with plenty of cute laughs and a hilarious voice performance by Kate McKinnon."
"173",1,"  They should have gotten better or more accurate voice actos that suit each character"
"174",5,"  its actually a good film"
"175",5,"  I love movies based on books. However I understand that making a children's book into a movie can be very hard. But personally this is the movie for me and it looks really good. I would rather see a bull smell flowers rather than Jedis cutting Droids for 2 hours."
"176",5,"  Went to see this movie with low expectation. I came out laughing my ass off, and content to have seen a funny light story. The goat character really made the movie."
"177",2,"  Not an ""Adult"" must see."
"178",4.5,"  A very fun and emotional movie. The plot was simple and yet it was still fun to see. Funny moments have their own place here and other serious ones too. The movie is exactly what I expected from the trailer. The movie shows that bullfighting isn't a right thing to do. In verdict, the movie is adorable, hilarious, and serious in it's own times"
"179",5,"  Great story with lots of heart. Fun to watch!"
"180",5,"  A absolutely hilarious but simultaneously heart-warming story of a bull born in a fighting ranch but who doesn't want to fight. John Cena does a magnificent job as a super-nice, massive bull who pursues his own destiny and stands up for friends and family. Simple but still wonderful....."
"181",5,"  Kids loved it, very endearing!"
"182",5,"  Cute story peppered through with great humor. Ferdinand casts its story of a pacifist bull without getting too sappy or hung up in heavy morals, the issue of animal rights, etc. It's an adventure I can't wait to watch a second time!"
"183",5,"  Saw it 3 times and got emotional in all of them. Amazing animation, is already one of the best of all times. Go see it."
"184",5,"  Good movie. Jolly good movie."
"185",2,"  screw this movie, complete waste of time, go watch star wars"
"186",4,"  A great movie for families to enjoy together. Great job bringing a book to the big screen."
"187",3,"  Wasn't the same magic as the book but decent film."
"188",2,"  I have to say, releasing your movie on the same weekend as the new Star Wars takes guts. It doesn't seem to take being a good movie, however, because Ferdinand isn't that good of a movie.For what it's worth, Ferdinand isn't a horrible movie. At the very least, it has a positive message to put out. The only complain I have against the animation is that the animals often look too human and the humans don't look human enough. Other than that, the animation holds up pretty well against other animated movies. The sound also stacks up well, but it sometimes falters. Inexplicably, the movie can lose its sense of audio balance. Dialogue or music can occasionally have too soft volume. Unfortunately for the movie, this happens at the worst possible moment: the climax, killing any emotional impact it could have had. The climax also suffers from a poor choice in soundtrack, which does not match the mood of the scene at all.Maybe Coco has spoiled me, but I was disappointed that a movie that portrays Spanish culture features almost no Hispanic actors in its main cast. There's not much cultural authenticity in this movie at all. In fact, for a movie that's all about defying stereotypes, it sure does feature a lot of benign stereotypes, notably David Tennant's (Doctor Who) Scottish bull. While I definitely would not call The Last Jedi a kids' movie, it probably is the better choice for kids right now."
"189",2.5,"  Grade: BRating: PG, 1 hour 46 minutesIn a Nutshell: I lived in Spain for a couple of years in my 20's, so I was curious to see Blue Sky Studio and 20th Century Fox would represent that beautiful country I fell in love with. I especially wanted to see how they would make what is normally a very brutal ""sport"" into a kid-friendly movie! I attended one bull fight in Spain. Once was enough. The truth is that bulls in the ring die a bloody, violent death. Does that sound like a kid movie to you?Honestly, I couldn't decide how I felt about this movie. The animation is colorful and sweet, but the backdrop for the entire story seems almost inappropriate for kids.Uplifting theme: We all have different dreams. Live yours.Control your fears.Flowers make the world a better place!Hate vs. love.Pets are family.Things I liked:Beautiful animation scenery and landscapes. Detailed animation brings richness to straw, dirt, water, chipped paint, and moisture on the bulls' nostrils. Based on The Story of Ferdinand , the original Disney short was first shown in 1938 and even won an Academy Award for Best Short! I thought it was funny when Ferdinand accidentally breathed in a caterpillar and then snorted out a fully-grown butterfly. Ha haThe film introduces kids to a few Spanish traditions which make the country unique and magical, such as flamenco dance, the flower festival (Feria de las flores), and white-washed streets lined with baskets of flowers. I liked it when they showed the old-fashioned, classic windmills of Spain and then the modernized windmills to contrast the rich tradition with the new Spain. It doesn't quite do for Spain what the movie Coco does for Mexico, but it was a nice start.Bull in a china shop. It had to be done.John Cena does a great job as the voice of Ferdinand.The dance battle scene was pretty cute.I never knew there was such a thing as a ""calming goat"" used around bulls. Kate McKinnon is a fantastic comedic actress, really bringing life to Lupe, the goofy goat.The Austrian horses may seem out of place in the movie, but the Lipizzaner show horses are actually really famous in Spain.Segways. Man, I love those. So much fun.It's amazing that they could build an entire feature film around a very short story.Nick Jonas' song Home has been nominated for a Golden Globe. The Ferdinand (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is sweet enough.Things I didn't like:It's not super funny with lots of quick laughs. The audience I watched the movie with was pretty quiet and didn't react much to what was happening on the screen.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles, but nothing important is said that would make those lines crucial to the story. They're just added in to enhance the flavor of Spain. The names of some of the characters are words in Spanish: Guapo (Handsome) and Valiente (Brave). The chase scene went from entertaining to completely ridiculous in about 2 seconds.Some movie critics complain that there are too many characters in this movie, but I didn't mind. Three great actors voiced the hedgehogs, yet I didn't even notice: Gina Rodriguez (I love her in Jane the VIRGIN), Gabriel Iglesias, and Daveed Diggs. They don't get that many lines, and you pay more attention to their antics than to their voices.Funny lines:""I've fallen and I can't giddy-up!"" - Austrian horse""I'm Una! I'm Dos! I'm Cuatro!"" - Hedgehogs""What happened to Tres?"" - Ferdinand""We do not speak of Tres."" - HedgehogsInteresting lines:""Why does not wanting to fight mean I'm scared?"" - Ferdinand (Great question! It often takes greater courage NOT to fight!)""If we don't look out for each other, who will?"" - FerdinandTips for parents: If your kids are sensitive to the horrors of killing animals for sport, this is not the movie for them. There is also a disgusting ""chop house"" scene that might turn your kids into vegans.It's a fairly long animation, and I noticed some of the younger children in the audience I sat with getting bored and fidgety.There is a scene where some characters sing and dance the ""Macarena."" Wow, young kids are definitely not going to know what that dance craze was. That was a LONG time ago!Your kids are probably going to want a pet hedgehog now. They may be shocked to learn that the adorable, little creatures don't come in pink and blue.There is sort of a gay undertone in that bulls are supposed to be manly and macho, yet Ferdinand just wants to play with flowers. In a trailer interview with wrestler-turned-actor John Cena, he explains that he can relate to Ferdinand and being judged, saying, ""Don't judge a bull by its cover."" Always a good lesson for your kids to learn. @trinaboice"
"190",2.5,"  There are plenty of animated films that follow the same sort of formula, make the kids laugh with silly humor but keep the adults entertained by throwing in a heartfelt message that resonates well with people of all ages. Ferdinand certainly tries to do just that with the story of an outsider just wanting to break the mold of being a tough fighter bull, but it also falls victim to the same sort of problems that most non-Disney/Pixar films do.It's always so easy to tell the difference between an animated film that is for all ages and one that is merely made for kids dragging their parents to the theater, and it has nothing to do with the animation style difference between studios. The real difference is in the humor and direction. Ferdinand is full of great voice talent from the improving John Cen, to Kate McKinnon, Daveed Diggs, or Gina Rodriguez. Heck it's even impressive in the look of Blue Sky's animation. However, I had a real issue with the use of that particular voice talent and animation that made the experience far from a worthy outing at the movies.When 98% of the humor is physical-slapstick cheap humor that has no substance or bearing on the actual story, then I constantly get the feeling there wasn't as much time or care put forth in the making of the film than there should be. Which in turn, can eliminate any emotion you did have attached with those particular characters in the first place if the film puts humor before heart.With that said, of course there are things to like about Ferdinand. There will always be place in Hollywood for stories about characters breaking the mold and doing something different, whether that be a human, animal, or even toy. Underneath all of the ridiculous humor, there is a nice arc for the character of Ferdinand and his various animal friends. To me though, the misplaced childish humor every few minutes interrupts any momentum for the real story to kick in.5.7/10"
"191",4,"  Nothing deep to make the audience think. Just a fun move for the family."
"192",4,"  Loved it! But maybe it was because I saw it with my 6yr old grandson who thought it was hilarious! ;o)"
"193",5,"  Ferdinand is a fun, entertaining and enjoyable movie for the whole family. Great animation, characters, funny moments and more! John Cena was born for this role!"
"194",5,"  Loved the movie!! heartfelt, funny and with an important message for kids and adults alike! A must see!!!!!"
"195",5,"  Fun, energetic, amazing film for the whole family! Ferdinand sends an important message that the we need in our world today."
"196",5,"  Its sad that some trolls are trying to give negative ratings to this movie without even watching it. I saw the audience score, it was 77%, then it went to 56%, then 65% and then again to 57%.This movie was very heart warming and I really liked it. I never thought that ever in my life I would think that an animated bull would be the cutest character ever. 1st and 3rd acts were great, 2nd act which was the middle portion was hit and miss, but for some reason every time the horses were on the screen, I couldn't help but smile because of their accent and dialog. Overall a really Good movie."
"197",2.5,"  Kids are going to love it, but imo so slow, boring & flat for all ages"
"198",5,"  Just like Star Wars: The Last Jedi I see that trolls are now also attacking this film and flooding it with 1/2 reviews! This becomes pretty clear when you read the real reviews here from people who've seen the film and most rate it positive. Yet you look at the score and it's negative! Little punks who do this and think it's funny need to get a damn life! Go watch these films for yourself before you make a decision and never let trolls and random idiots on the internet make up your mind for you."
"199",4,"  My 6 and 8 year old loved it."
"200",5,"  Fun, visually stunning, and a classic story. What's not to love? I left the theater feeling absolutely happy. SEE FERDINAND! You won't regret it."
"201",5,"  LOVED this movie! Excellent for the entire family. Great message and absolutely hilarious!!!!"
"202",4,"  Fun movie. My kids were totally entertained."
"203",5,"  I am still smiling ????????"
"204",5,"  A must see! A family movie that inspires everyone! "" I am Ferdinand"""
"205",3,"  A mildly amusing flick. I went to see it with a four, 6, and seven year old.The four year old asked ""Why did he do that?"" for almost every scene, he couldn't follow the character motivations, but laughed at the 3 minutes of slapstick pratfalls every ten minutes. The six year old started whining ""I'm bored, can we go home now?"" after 15 minutes and kept it up non-stop till the end. The seven year old enjoyed the whole thing. Seven to ten year olds wil probably be the best audience. For adults, the movie was VERY PC. Anti- bullfighting (more of a european issue), anti-meat (we watch the bulls escape in terror from a meat- packing plant). Tons of general anti- violence messages. Tons of butterflies and flowers. And quite a few flowery characters. Watchable, but would have flowed much better if it were 30 minutes shorter."
"206",3.5,"  Love the story as I've always loved the book - Kate McKinnon's goat is hilarious. John Cena's Ferdinand is honest. All that said it is clear this is a ""B"" level studio effort - especially on animation and scoring."
"207",5,"  I loved Ferdinand. I was unsure how they could have a whole movie about a Bull who loves flowers and not fighting but they certainly did it. It was charming and great for all ages."
"208",5,"  Ferdinand is one of the most entertaining, highly excellent and laugh out movies I've ever watched in the world. The movie Ferdinand has a lot of messages behind its story and I find them ... you know, great and a worth-remembering sort of thing. This movie touched my heart the moment I watched it, and it was rare because it had never happened to me, before, and this film deserves to be remembered for a long time. Its less expected funny moments, the story original enough to put a smile on my face, the bonds of immense friendships, thrilling adventures & an unbreakable love between a loving, little girl and a tough, gentle bull who loves sniffing flowers.This film is perfect for all families of the young and the old out there, so come to Hoyts and enjoy the adventure! It's waiting for you! 11/10 I 100% love this movie and you should, too!"
"209",5,"  Was a great movie. Had some great family humour and my daughter loved it."
"210",3.5,"  Animation was superb. Like the story. Enjoyed the movie."
"211",4.5,"  I'm surprised to see the average rating of this animation, which was lower than I'd expected. Actually, the film is really cute. Although the story-line is not very attractive, the color, the music and the drawings are far enough to satisfy my need. Overall, strongly recommended for all age range."
"212",2.5,"  hard to believe this film had two golden globe nods."
"213",5,"  Cute movie, nice message. Nice pick for kids!"
"214",3,"  Ferdinand offers plenty of zany animation, solid voice acting, and some decent humor, even if its narrative doesn't quite take us anywhere new, it makes for some fun family entertainment...after seeing Star Wars!"
"215",5,"  this movie is unforget-a-bull!"
"216",5,"  Best animated movie of the year"
"217",4.5,"  Their was dancing XD"
"218",5,"  Haven't laughed so hard in AGES! Totally worth sharing and hoping it will change some animal destinies..."
"219",5,"  Well Done Blue Sky Stidios! Well Done! Though not as good as coco but at the end of the day it's its own thing and presents its own valuable lessons that children must be aware of!!"
"220",5,"  was a very cute movie and kind of like a bulling lesson and being a friend. The little ones were taking it all in, including the cutting up parts, just a really good teaching tool for sure. To bad you can't make movies for adults like thisthey too need a teaching tool."
"221",5,"  Kate McKinnon once again steals the show!"
"222",4.5,"  Took my son to see this movie, it was surprising pleasant. My son loves John Cena so I was pretty much forced to watch it haha. Ended up much happier with it than I expected."
"223",2.5,"  Missing the heart of the book."
"224",5,"  Emotional, funny and honest. Throughly enjoyed this film. Loved the fact it was based in Spain/Madrid. A place I really love."
"225",4,"  A very charming family movie which (given the lack of animation movies around at the moment) is a very worthy trip to the cinema."
"226",4,"  John Cena is a fighting bull and a fighting champ!!!Ferdinand is an animation about a bull who doesn't fight, who loves flowers, who wants his own freedom. John Cena casted as Ferdinand, the nice bull, did pretty well voicing a main character. The story is written well, depicting the livelihood of the animals which taken place in Spain, it may have misses some things which some of the audience might catch on but it's strong in the admiration of the characters, the inspiration by all traits of Ferdinand and his farm friends. See Ferdinand, you might have some fun with it."
"227",2,"  Unfortunately, 20th Century Fox once again did not learn their lesson to release juvenile crap on the same day Star Wars hits theaters. They got awfully owned by the way better Force Awakens when it came to that Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. Ferdinand, on the other hand, attempts to become way better than Fox's latest attempt to bring the chipmunks back to theaters but that doesn't mean that Ferdinand is a second option to send children or basically the whole family just in case they have already seen the latest Star Wars movie. I just wish 20th Century Fox would just stop releasing movies like these on the same day as Star Wars gets released to theaters unless they can bring a way better movie that isn't juvenile like their latest attempts yet. Literally worth the shot once it becomes able for rent but don't expect to find anything that can hold this movie back from its score."
"228",5,"  just saw it!..this movie is awesome, this movie kills The Last Jedi! This movie got lots of balls, going against Starwars..ironically this movie is not Bull $h1T#!..get it..get it.. all you star wars fans won't get it....oops that's me!"
"229",5,"  I will love to see Ferdinand. :) In fact, Ferdinand is a good movie and Blue Sky Studios looks so good. I know, I will love to see it on the movie with my family. :)"
"230",5,"  Super excited to see this one!!"
"231",3.5,"  I'm rating it 3 1/2 because Blue Sky Studios has some serious balls to release the same day as Star Wars"
"232",4,"  At least Blue Sky has decided to put an end, to all of the pointless Ice Age sequels. Ferdinand is...a kinda good movie I guess. It is worth watching and for a good laugh."
"233",5,"  I'm going to see it the first day because is ferdinand the bull and since a little kid they been telling ohhh wow you have the name of the book ferdinand the bull lol it's kind of funny but yes my name is ferdinand Padilla I would love to meet the cast of that movie especially John cena"

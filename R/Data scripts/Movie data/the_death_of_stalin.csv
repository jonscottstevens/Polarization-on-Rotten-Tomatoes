"1",0.5,"  Run save yourself, the worst movie ever"
"2",0.5,"  Thi is a quite bad movie. I don't understand why it is considered a comedy when there is a lot of killing going on. I don't know why there is fun made of a dead body of dictator even if we know he was awful. I guess because I live behind the iron curtain, I don't understand such ""humor."" Why is F-word used over and over without reason is another reason why I can't give it more stars. How disappointing. I was so much looking forward to see this movie."
"3",4.5,"  Funniest movie I have seen in awhile. Buscemi crushes Khruschev role."
"4",1,"  The first thing I did not like was that NO ONE had a Russian accent! The movie was not funny, except for a line or two. I was so looking forward to something fun like Monty Python. So sad and disappointed with this."
"5",1,"  One hour into the movie, neither me, or my wife, or the whole theater audience save for one guy in the back row had chuckled once. For the first time in our marriage, we got up and walked out feeling we had wasted enough of the everning. I think we were all expecting more comedy and less drama. Definitely not in the ""Best Film Of The Year"" team photo."
"6",2.5,"  Chosen for its cast, sadly disappointing"
"7",1,"  I went into the theatre expecting to laugh - I laughed twice! The movie could not decide if it was trying to be a comedy or a sick twisted farce. It succeeded a bit as a farce - but it was not funny at all. It got really perverted when they shot Beria in the head and then set his dead body on fire."
"8",5,"  Tremendous cast, laugh out loud funny about mass murder. It is very hard to write that sentence."
"9",4.5,"  Satire at its best, this movie shows the basic incompetence of political systems relying on total control from its start to its finish. My only real complaint was the ending seemed a bit rushed, but otherwise, this is one dynamite film."
"10",5,"  Fantastic. I only wish it was three or four hours long so they could have more gags."
"11",4,"  Laugh out loud funny and even a little educational. Solid acting, tight script, well produced, offering a lot of insight into the nature of people, power, and fear."
"12",2,"  As a fan of Veep I did not find this movie very funny at all. No one in our theater was laughing much at all."
"13",1,"  What an annoying stupid movie. I guess it was supposed to be a satire but not that funny, mostly pathetic. And whatever technique they used while filming made it seem out of focus out of the time which gave me a headache and forced me to keep my eyes closed a lot."
"14",2.5,"  It was average. The trailer made it appear funnier than it was. The comedy was very dry."
"15",5,"  Hilarious in all the right places. Lots of fun."
"16",5,"  Did not expect stalin to die 5/5"
"17",2.5,"  I really wanted to love this movie. There are some incredible comedic actors in it and it's all well-acted. It's honestly just not very funny. It tries to be funny but the jokes fall flat. I couldn't tell if it was scripted or improv in many cases because it seemed like one liners were added in the shoots that weren't crafted. I honestly think many of the positive reviews are because people really expected it to be great more than they experienced a great film."
"18",2,"  The farce is strong is this historical train wreck. Bleh."
"19",4.5,"  The post-Stalin Russkees knew how to play ""hard ball"". This was a well acted film that portrayed the evils and stupidity of the Malenkov/Bulganin/Kruschev/Molotov era in a most graphic way. The political humor was there but most often subsummed by the cruelty and nefarious scheming by the Stalinist proteges. Beria was a prime example of Soviet evil at its apex. Enjoyable, and a bit ""over the top"" but educational and ""dark"" nevertheless!"
"20",2,"  Buffoonish and deadly boring. I quickly lost patience trying to follow the silly plot and ridiculous machinations by myriad characters. I would never have gone to see this movie except for the rating by Rotten Tomatoes. Leaves me in doubt about relying on RT to choose movies in the future."
"21",5,"  Hilarious take on actual history. Must see!!!"
"22",5,"  Director Armando Iannucci delivers another A+ political satire with The Death of Stalin, a film just as sharp, ballsy, and hilarious as his 2009 debut In The Loop."
"23",5,"  A must-see. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, with a generous heaping of well-earned laughs from a biting script. And the filmmakers wisely spread the laughs a little thinner as the film moves into more serious territory."
"24",0.5,"  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not funny. Not serious. Not fun. Not cerebral. A total waste of time. I need to read some reviews to find out what 96% of critics saw that I didn't."
"25",3,"  Some of the punch lines go by so fast it's hard to catch all of them. It was hard to reconcile a comedy with all the atrocities that were taking place."
"26",4.5,"  A comical farce of at times Mel Brooks-like flavor though so much darker, but that level of absurd interaction between hollow people in crisis... you laugh and you laugh and then the ending hits you square in the forehead, and out the back with your mind blown, as you suddenly remember and realize who you are watching on screen and what happened next in reality... that the farce you just watched is only lightly fictionalized and that it bears all-too-real resemblance to a more current farce here in our own nation, and all that laughter goes to a dark, quiet, far off place...."
"27",4,"  A surprise, and a ""good"" movie. Perhaps a breath of fresh air considering the state of the business."
"28",4,"  While the bigger picture might get lost in the feverish antics and general hilarity, Death of Stalin is a great comedy with some serious things to ponder."
"29",4,"  I saw The Death of Stalin Saturday at the AMC Rolling Hills 20 using my Movie Pass (which again worked as advertised). This movie is a dark, satirical comedy about the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1947 and the events leading up to it and afterwards. A great cast in a movie that reminded me of a dark, bizaro Blazing Saddles or Saturday Night Live."
"30",1.5,"  I think I chuckled lightly twice. Very boring movie."
"31",5,"  I want everyone associated with this movie to make the Trump movie when it comes out! Brilliant, hilarious, unusual. Simon Russel Beale is a gem turning one of histories worst players into well, a comedic monster. Buscemi is perfect, as he always is, I laughed out loud a dozen times, at least, and after, went to looking these people up. Had to know the real stories and - amazingly - this isn't far from the truth. Congratulations to all involved."
"32",2.5,"  The Death of Statlin is an odd eent for a comedy. This is what still has me shaking my head adn that was the tione of the movie. It is very amusing in an ironic way because the events how portrayed were real but many of the events seen and heard about were indiscriminate killing, torturing, and imprisonment, still hard to find laughable. As much as I am huge fan of Veep, I really didn't get this movie at all and am disappointed that I didn't connect to it"
"33",1,"  Have not seen anything remotely engaging since 'Shape of Water, really hope this would break the drought...havibg said that - would probably work well in live theatre"
"34",5,"  Chilling, dark humor. So well done."
"35",2.5,"  Walked out after 45 minutes poor excuse as Russians font have englishAccents. Not even funny as a dark comedy, rotten tomatoe score way Off unless you have trouble sleeping then score is correct"
"36",4.5,"  Dark and funny political satire. Given what's going on in Russia right now, it's also a timely movie. Watching the power struggle that happened after the death of Stalin was hilariously portrayed in this movie and was actually made funnier by having Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor play Khrushchev and Malenkov. I wound up really liking this movie"
"37",5,"  If you can handle pitch black comedy do not miss! Great acting, relentless, almost action movie-style pacing. And, of course, with the rise of authoritarian governments, timely."
"38",2,"  Hard to be as enthusiastic as other reviews because the poor audio made it difficult to catch all the dialogue. Whether it was the audio of the theater, the audio recording at time of filming, or poor directing of the actors related to speaking parts. May try to see it again at another venue, but will do so after a quick history refresher."
"39",4,"  It's often raucously hilarious, neatly crafted, sometimes visually striking, packed with excellent performances and abrasively profane dialogue. Most significant of all, it's true."
"40",5,"  The Death of Stalin is one of the best big-screen satires I've seen in years. The all-star cast included many actors from English theatre. They brought the best of the stage with them, from excellent body language to perfect comedic timing. The film had everything that is required to make a dark, uncomfortable, complex and historical drama something worth laughing and thinking about. The film also did a great job of communicating to outsiders what is known about the last days of Stalin's rule and has a great time exploring the possible dramas that might have ensued in the wake of his death. Buscemi, Peale and Tambor stand out as excellent players, although they are well supported by a strong cast and robust writing. The Death of Stalin is one of my new favourite movies. While the genre may be too dark for the mainstream, this picture is certainly an instant cult classic."
"41",3.5,"  Enjoyable, amusing farce. not many big laughs."
"42",4.5,"  Manages to be funny while telling the truth. Very dark."
"43",2.5,"  It had its moments, but wasn't nearly as much a comedy as I was expecting. The gestalt joke of it got a little old by the end of the movie. That said, Jeffrey Tambor's performance was probably the best."
"44",1,"  Boring, superficial farce and a painfully missed opportunity."
"45",0.5,"  How did this get rated highly? it's not funny. boring. and violent. are the studios now hacking rotten tomatoes to sell movies?"
"46",4,"  couldn't quite figure out if it was supposed to be funny, but sure seems like Russia hasn't changed much regardless"
"47",1,"  This was not as funny as the trailer. Very dry."
"48",4.5,"  Hilarious, and startlingly dark. But funny. But, seriously, dark."
"49",5,"  Loved this movie. Absolutely brilliant satire and the acting is terrific."
"50",0.5,"  PROPAGANDA, barely veiled. This movie tried to make a joke of a vast State-led web of violence against society including forced disappearance, torture and rape. Never okay, especially in an era where fascism is gaining momentum across the western world. Furthermore the ridiculousness made it Impossible to discern historical accuracy in the film. There was no protagonist to cheer for. to be fair, plot arc was satisfying and there was some okay acting. Overall this film was a cheap(by which i mean hugely costly and timewasting) shot at Putin."
"51",4.5,"  Paddy Considine is the director of Radio Moscow. The evening's entertainment is a Mozart piano concerto. He receives a phone call from Josef Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) saying he would like a recording of the concert. The problem is that nobody has recording it. Considine panics and refuses to let the orchestra or the audience leave, staging the whole concert over again to get the recording, although he needs to bribe pianist Olga Kurylenko, replace the conductor who has passed out, and grab some spare audience members off the street. This sets the tome for this amazing film. Stalin dies this same night, setting off a power struggle between Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and Lavrenti Beria (Simon Russell Beale). Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor) is nominally in charge, but a war of deceit and manipulation ensues to see who can out maneuver each other and take the rains. This is a hilariously black comedy, until it turns immensely dark and isn't a comedy anymore. These shifts in tone are handled with aplomb and you barely notice that you've stopped laughing and are gasping in horror."
"52",4,"  ""The Death of Stalin"" is a deep farce, but it is rooted in enough political reality that it hardly feels sensationalized. And given the current state of politics, it's as on-point as a breaking news alert."
"53",5,"  Fast-paced, manic, and dark as Hades. The Death of Stalin takes an amazing cast and hands them a fabulous script. Laughing and horrified at the same time. Well worth seeing."
"54",3.5,"  Entertaining and funny"
"55",2,"  ""The Death of Stalin"" is an ambitious film that attempts to tackle overwhelmingly dark subject matter with wit and although it does manage a few laughs it come off as irreverent."
"56",2,"  I give the film high marks for scenery, costumes, and a story based upon history. I expected a farcical comedy with dark humor and viewed a film with extreme dark comedy marked with frequent violence and abusive behavior that took away considerably from the intent of a satirical movie. The actors, however, all did their best. I heard infrequent laughs from the audience."
"57",5,"  Very well done and funny too. It is the rare writer and director who can turn a story of terror, murder, intrigue and depsoitism into a buffon comic opera. The cast is great and who wouldn't love Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khruschev?"
"58",4.5,"  This is a fantastic contemporary piece of bureaucratic absurdism. Armondo Ianucci's hyper realistic approach to the chaos that ensues once centralized government collides with the worse aspects of human nature. Fantastic performances and razor sharp writing make this darkly comic depiction of its eponymous subject all the more gripping."
"59",5,"  Dark fun movie, a definite yes go see."
"60",2,"  This film is supposed to be an uproarious dark comedy. It is dark. The Three Stooges moments are a little humorous. Unfortunately, the story is accurate enough that you can't forget the horrors of Stalin's regime. Steve Buscemi's conniving Kruschev and Jeffrey Tambor's bumbling Malenkov are the highlights of the movie."
"61",4,"  Who would have guessed that a movie about the death of Stalin and the subsequent jockeying for power to take his place could be done as a vaudeville piece? And be successful! This is a bold experiment that really works, complete with very serious scenes of force and slapstick to give a dizzying feeling of what was going on in 1953 Russia..."
"62",0.5,"  Awful, boring, couldn't wait for it to end. Lol maybe twice."
"63",4,"  Great satire that rises to the challenge of the comedies of errors surrounding Stalin's death. Hilarious and knowing."
"64",1,"  My husband and I were looking forward to what we'd been led to believe would be a smart and very funny film. Neither of us laughed at all. We generally like dark comedy, dry humor, and historical satire, but this simply wasn't funny at all. Only a few people in the theater laughed, but they laughed pretty hard. Maybe they'd spent more time at the bar than we had. It was one if the worst films we've seen in a long time."
"65",1,"  Terrible movie. I guess it was Russian slapstick, but it wasn't funny and it was dark comedy that made fun of killing people and other painful activities."
"66",5,"  Scathingly brilliant. Such dark subject matter, but done so brilliantly it's laugh out loud funny. All the actors are fantastic and Steve Buscemi is absolutely fantastic. I just saw it and I want to see it again as soon as possible"
"67",4,"  Not an expert on the history of Russia in the 1950s but this movie showed the the political realities of leadership change in a very farcical and "" Monty Python-ish "" way. Very good acting by some recognizable faces in different roles. Laugh out loud moments .??"
"68",4.5,"  I laughed a lot but most of the audience was quiet. This is absurdist dry comedy about stuff subjects even darker than Dr. Strangelove. I love it but 95% of my friends would hate it. Trust me."
"69",2,"  ""The Laughs come in jolts and waves with savage one-liners.""Manohla Dargis New York Times""Often Hilarious"" Michael Phillips Chicago Tribune""A unique and hilarious British comedy.""Mike LaSalle San Francisco Chronicle""Source of hilarity and it is hilarious.""Bill Goodykoontz Arizona Republic""A complete bore! Did the above critics see the same movie I saw?""GreatMartin""The Death of Stalin"" is set in the 1950s and the fight for power in Russia after the dictator's death. Are you laughing yet? It supposedly is satire which implies irony or sarcasm and the director/writer, Armando Iannucci, tries everything from the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges slapstick to insult comedy, chaos, no attempt at Russian accents having various accents ranging from Brooklyn to London but getting very few reactions from the audience.Iannucci is the writer of the much awarded HBO series ""Veep"" known for its comedy, irony, and sarcasm which it delivers with belly laughs, smiles, smirks, and humor while here he enlists 2 additional writers and the only smile/laugh I can remember is a crack about Grace Kelly!The cast consisting of Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, Simon Russell Beale, Adrian McLoughlin, Jeffrey Tambor, Olga Kurylenko, Rupert Friend, Jason Issacs, Paddy Considine among others deliver the expected performances with a little scenery chewing now and then.Enjoy seeing people shot in the head, brains taken out of a head after the scalp is cut back and 'fun' things like that? Can you go another day without knowing that most good doctors in Russia were killed and that Stalin had lists of people to be killed?Those answering 'yes' to any of the questions asked should probably go and see ""The Death of Stalin"".The only questions I am asking myself is have I lost my sense of humor as I've grown older or is funny and/or satire not what it was defined years ago?"
"70",3.5,"  QUIT STALINThe death of a ruthless dictator is often followed by total chaos, usually not of the funny variety. Except here. Here it's quite funny.Too early? Shouldn't be after all this was 1953, but the atrocities of the Soviet state were indeed, quite brutal. Thus the fine line balancing act begins. Armando Iannucci has bitten deep into political farce with Veep, The Thick of It, and In The Loop, but this is on another level altogether. As the masses are being rounded up and flippantly disposed of, the heads of state quibble nonsensically over tedious issues whilst plotting their personal power trips. Portraying eventual successor (spoiler) Nikita Krushev, Steve Buscemi is fabulously frazzled and slyly devious, but it is the truly vitriolic performance of Simon Russell Beale as the vile Lavrentiy Beria that steals the show. It's not easy to dip below the slimy levels of Stalin's henchmen, but Beale accomplishes the creepy feat with Shakespearian vigour. Too bad not all of the cast, especially the usually adept Jeffrey Tambor, can't keep up.To the film's credit, the great purge is not a mere backdrop to the Marx Brothers style frivolity, but a harsh companion. Torture and executions mix with all the bumbling. Risky, and perhaps the reason for steering the comedy away from physical to verbal. A bit of an unfilled tease with Monty Pythoner Michael Palin along for the ride, but so be it. Bet Vladimir Putin's not in any hurry to catch this one.- hipCRANK"
"71",4,"  Very funny political satire with chilling parallels to today's current political climate."
"72",5,"  If you like Veep, the Thick of It and In The Loop, this is a no-brainer. Dark, funny, and smart."
"73",4.5,"  Like an offspring of Dr. Strangelove and In The Loop, The Death of Stalin features great performances and is filled with humor that is so sharp because there is real political horror behind the jokes"
"74",5,"  Excellent and hilarious. Don't miss it."
"75",2,"  I was ready for great political satire, but it just wasn't funny. Clever, but too corny for me. I think I laughed once before I walked out about an hour into it. For what it's worth, no one else in the theatre was laughing, either."
"76",3.5,"  Too silly and fast paced,even though it is based on historic events. I should have studied my Russian history"
"77",5,"  loved it! witty and fast 9/10"
"78",5,"  Truely lives up to the reviews, including ""Funniest Movie of the 21st century""."
"79",4.5,"  See it soon. Then see it again with your children, grandchildren and especially those darn in-laws. Bring a bottle. Wine is fine but Vodka is a better fit."
"80",0.5,"  A terrible parody/comedy. Except for the scene with the dog at the secret meeting...that was funny."
"81",2,"  ""The Death of Stalin"" (R, 1:46) is a British political satire comedy, co-written and directed by Armando Iannucci, based on a French graphic novel, about the events leading up to, surrounding and immediately following the 1953 demise of Joseph Stalin, the long-time leader of the U.S.S.R. You might well wonder whether the violence of the Soviet dictator's regime would be appropriate fodder for a comedy film, or whether such a comedy could even work. Fair questions and, after watching this film, I'd say valid ones.The film opens with a dinner party thrown by Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) and attended by his inner circle of Nikita Khrushchev and Georgy Malenkov (Golden Globe and Emmy winners Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor), Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Vyacheslav Molotov (Monty Python veteran Michael Palin). During that gathering, Stalin causes a minor panic by in a concert hall by personally asking for a recorded copy of that night's performance, and panic also comes to various individuals around Moscow as Stalin's security forces go after those on his most recent enemies list, as published by Beria. All of this tells us a lot about the main characters and Stalin's regime and nicely sets the stage for what is to come.The rest of the movie concerns itself with the titular event and its aftermath, focusing on the comical inefficiency of the Soviet regime and backstabbing among its high-ranking officials. After the aforementioned dinner party, after Stalin reads some hate mail sent to him by an idealistic and gutsy musician (Olga Kurylenko), then has a medical episode and collapses. Over the next 12 hours or so, Stalin's personal security detail, various government officials and a motley crew of doctors who are eventually called, all bungle their responses and Stalin dies. Then Stalin's children, a naïve drama queen (Andrea Riseborough) and an unhinged alcoholic (Emmy nominee Rupert Friend) show up, adding to the mayhem, followed quickly by the self-important Soviet Army chief, Field Marshall Zhukov (Jason Isaacs). Meanwhile, the men in the dead dictator's inner circle jockey for power and scheme against each other.""The Death of Stalin"" is clever, but not as funny as it wants to be. The movie tries to walk the fine line between taking the events it depicts somewhat seriously and showing the ridiculousness of the Soviet system in the early-mid 1950s and the men who ran it. The film walks that line well, but in doing so, fails to be very entertaining. The tragic historical facts of Stalin's murderous regime and the way its inefficiency fueled the Cold War with the United States makes the jokes less funny, but the nods to the seriousness of those situations keep the jokes from going far enough to be funnier. Despite the excellent cast, that middle-of-the-road approach to making a comedy about Stalin's death results in a middle-of-the-road grade from me, teetering on the edge of whether to recommend this movie or not... but barely coming down on the side of not. ""C+"""
"82",4,"  A slanted take on history which doesn't loose its historical accuracy and the satrical rediculousness that also mirrors the present day."
"83",4.5,"  This reminds me so much of a PG13 Tarantino. Such a fun ride!"
"84",3.5,"  This movie drives right up to the cliff of bad taste, and presses the accelerator. I really almost left, but then asked myself, could a similar movie be made about Hitler? Well, it has. The British are particularly good at Hitler/Nazi humor, and if I can laugh at Monty Python gags about that, I can sit through this.My discomfort was probably heightened at first by the unreality of all the mixed accents, British and American, high and lowbrow. Steve Buscemi sounds exactly like Steve Buscemi for instance, profanity and all. As long as we stick with the comical bickering between members of the Central Committee, this rolicks along, and is pretty funny. But those few scenes where Beria is trolling the halls of Lubyanka, and awful things are happening literally in the hallways around him, one starts to squirm again. The other reason to feel strange watching this is because Jeffrey Tambor has been thrown down the memory hole, except for this movie. I wonder if he was on the first draft of the poster, and then removed like the scratched out faces from historical photographs that appear during the end credits?Just when it seems the bickering has played out, in strides Jason Isaacs as Marshall Zhukov, to save the day by having the Red Army reassert its prominence over the NKVD. And we can all breathe a sigh of relief by the end, because the Beria that the Committee was joking with at the start of the film has been denounced in an entirely non-comic way and summarily executed, in a sequence that appears to be tacked on to make us feel less guilty for our earlier laughter. Good to see Michael Palin again too."
"85",4.5,"  4.5* Over the top satire that may not be that far from the horrible truth. Still we laughed loudly but giggled nervously when it seemed a lot like current events. Good cast. I am old enough to know exactly what Khrushchev looked like so Buscemi remained Buscemi. That may have made it even funnier."
"86",4,"  Excellent comedy depicting the state of affairs of Russian politics after the death of Stalin and the power vacuum created. Simon Russell Beale is a standout in this great cast as Lavrenti Beria. The operatic soundtrack is exceptionally good and does what many modern films don't, has a thematic tune that is very memorable."
"87",4,"  A devilishly funny dark comedy that skewers the lunacy of bureaucracy and the buffoonish behavior of the power hungry, set in the wake of the demise of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1953. The film's stellar ensemble cast, combined with a wickedly funny script and endless touches of high camp, make for uproariously funny viewing. Not all of the jokes work, and sometimes the film gets a little too political, but, these shortcomings aside, ""The Death of Stalin"" serves up loads of big laughs. Enjoy, comrade."
"88",3,"  Quite an enjoyable but far from riveting watch, ""The Death Of Stalin"" is a witty satire boosted enormously by the delicious cast. Jeffrey Tambor steals the show, Steve Buscemi is Steve Buscemi and the dialogues and overall feel are definitely fun without entering farcical territory. On the other hand, the story can be a bit all over the place at times, seemingly out of focus, and it's a shame that actors such as Michael Palin and Paddy Considine had such small, and not that demanding, parts."
"89",5,"  From the Director of In the Loop, a sardonic, funny take on the frightfulness of the Soviet Union. Brilliant acting, razor sharp writing, hints that this is how actual historical events actually played out while we're left to read official histories that gloss over the absurdity of it all."
"90",0.5,"  How it happened that so obviously nationalistic and low morally behaviour can appear in cinemas? Yesterday it was blacks in USA, then Jews in Europe, now Russians in Ukraine and England. Also, there are certain moral values in every nation - you are not supposed to laugh and dance on grave of other people tragic history. Not surprised low morally people are low professionals as well. Found jokes not funny, boring unknown actors and the whole movie is boring and yak. Like listening to screaming of losers. Left after 20 min"
"91",4.5,"  Iannucci pulls off both farce and horror simultaneously. Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev is already my favorite performance of the year."
"92",3.5,"  This isn't really a comedy--something that I'd been led to believe somehow before watching this movie, but a rather ruthless and unforgiving movie showing many disturbing things of those old times and ending in a rather gruesome way. The casting is great and the actors each do a great job."
"93",1,"  Let's start from ""In the Loop"": critics loved it, so I watched it, or should I say tried to watch it. After 30 minutes I had to stop. For me wasn't funny at all. Actually I found it pretty annoying. Second chance given with this movie and... more of the same. Is it a comedy? So why I don't laugh? Why I find it so amazingly tedious?? Is it me? Possible. So Dear Armando Iannucci, it i not you, it's me... But this is not meant to be!"
"94",0.5,"  disgusting movie and worse, rethinking the watch-anything-with-an-actor-from-arrested-development rule"
"95",5,"  Absolutely superb film. Hilariously funny from beginning to end despite the very dark backdrop, up there with the best Thick of It episodes, can't wait to see what he does next."
"96",3,"  Had Larry, Moe, and Curly made a film about the Politburo this might have been it. A slight but amusing look at the death of communist dictator Stalin and his erstwhile cronies. As long as you can stomach the light touch given these butchers, you may enjoy this nicely scored and shot effort ."
"97",3.5,"  Armando Iannucci creates his uncomfortable style of satire pretty well in this complicated piece of Russian history. Its also solid on the humor, by providing great laughs of its cast member, just not in strives, which holds it a little back."
"98",5,"  It's a masterpiece with tones of tragedy, black humor and rustic-soviet elegance."
"99",3,"  I didn't think it was possible but they actually went a little too far for me with the satire and black humor at times, joking about stuff that was just too ghastly. But most of it was okay and overall it was watchable. My rating is coming in below the consensus though - and not just because of the going-too-far thing. I just didn't find it as funny as it thinks it is. 6 out of 10."
"100",5,"  Brilliant. The best of Veep by way of Inglorious Bastards (minus the Inglorious Bastards themselves). This movie is a triumph on all levels. Funny, poignant, and brilliantly navigating a huge cast of unforgettable characters."
"101",4.5,"  A Phenomenal film that finds humor in a dark period of History. while the tragedies are never made fun of, the struggle for power over the soviet union is ripe with laughs. With a great ensemble cast, the movie almost never lags and can deliver the same sharp jabs that Iannucci's VEep does."
"102",2,"  excellent ensemble cast delivered the clever script with consummate skill. top production values. shame it didn't make me laugh. one of those dad's you put on a prominent shelf to impress your much more intellectual friends but never watch again."
"103",5,"  Incredibly well done film. Dark, funny, and insightful."
"104",4,"  Someday someone is going to make a film about the Trump administration and its going to feel a lot like this. And if I'm still alive at that point I am going to LAUGH. HYSTERICALLY. But until then I can continue laughing at this foul-mouthed black comedy that perfectly balances the dark historical aspects of the story with the pure absurdity of the situation."
"105",5,"  Character-driven comedies are my favourite; let's just create a bizarre group of people, throw them in a room together, and set some sort of goal. Then, sit back and enjoy the magic. I loved this film."
"106",4,"  That British humor is dry, isn't it? Add in the weight of Soviet Russia's legacy of domestic oppression, and you've got yourself some of the blackest humor that side of the Atlantic. Upon first viewing, I can easily say that the The Death of Stalin is one of the most impressive political satires I've seen since Four Lions. It's only fitting that it would be in line with it, considering that Four Lion's writer Chris Morris worked several times back in the 90's with director Armando Iannucci on Up Yer News and The Day Today. As is expected of that school of humor, The Death of Stalin delivers some levity under such grave subject matter as one of the most brutal political regimes of the 20th century.Based on a series of French comic books, the story recounts the power vacuum subsequent to Secretary General Joseph Stalin's death while taking liberties with the true events to skewer the people who squabbled over replacing him. Aside from the beautifully constructed period design, the actors don't bother to feign silly Russian accents à la Red Sparrow, compounding the absurdly acerbic proceedings with a dose of unreality. Steve Buscemi's Brooklyn accent fits right into his role as Nikita Khrushchev. His natural jittering charisma no doubt reflecting that of his real life counterpart (at least relative to the west's decidedly low opinion of the Russian bureaucracy at the time) while remaining firm-footed in the world of charicature. I had to do a double take, but Michael Palin is a treat to behold on screen after all of these years. As for Jeffrey Tambor, we can't talk about his prolific acting career or how good his performance is as the push-over fill-in for Stalin, Georgy Malenkov, because he's a sex pervert, so forget I even mentioned it.Aside from the stellar cast, the writing is top-notch and is disturbingly indicative of the tenants of a ruling elite when it isn't laugh-out-loud funny. As it was in production before the Trump administration, it would be easy to confuse it for an outright attack on this return to charismatic authoritarianism, but The Death of Stalin is complementary to our current political situation in the same way that Dr. Strangelove... was to rising Cold war tensions because they are both alarmingly pertinent to their times and settings while providing a general critique on the abuse of power all throughout history. I must warn you though, the juxtaposition of senseless violence with slapstick humor and bureaucratic chicanery is tonal whiplash, and it caught me off-guard a few times. However, it's so well executed it might have even brought a smile to the horrible despot himself."
"107",3,"  Pretty genuinely funny, which I was not expecting. A great one for me and my roommate with a hammer and sickle tattoo to watch together."
"108",5,"  Like the finest of political satire, The Death of Stalin shows an absurd reality and encourages more than a few laughs while also taking the historical material seriously and not making mockery out of the numerous lives that were lost."
"109",2,"  A bloody event in Soviet history made in the form of a comedy. Funny."
"110",4,"  A very-good first act + An OK second act + A great third act = A decent political satire movie"
"111",4,"  the bickering and the humour are of it's own style. an interesting subject to portray but it comes off."
"112",5,"  probably the funniest film that i have ever seen."
"113",0.5,"  Neither funny nor historical. A complete waste of ten quid. It was difficult to see what the film was trying to say. Wasn't even bad enough to be entertaining in a perverse sort of way.. Tempted to take it back to shop on the basis that there is something wrong with this DVD - it is rubbish."
"114",4.5,"  This is one of those films where you end up laughing at outright tragedy. Satire and black comedy had one hell of a fling with this one. whoever cast this movie should be getting all the casting jobs"
"115",2,"  ok. Too grim at first, then only reaches mildly amusing occasionally.I find the accent choices amusing."
"116",5,"  Funniest, smartest film of 2017. You can find these characters at the top of any great institution. Iannucci is a genius."
"117",4,"  The paranoid horrors of the USSR merge brilliantly with Dr. Strangelove-esque satire."
"118",1.5,"  So boring I fell asleep."
"119",0.5,"  documentary style film, poor acting and waste of time"
"120",4,"  No BAFTAS for this beauty. Don't wonder why? This scabrously funny, yet horrific comedy cuts a chill so icy that any left wing leaning lovey would run a mile to avoid awarding it. It's a brilliant piece of work with a brilliant cast shedding an absurdist light onto the most inhuman of regimes."
"121",5,"  If you were to think, the chaos that erupted in Stalin's Central Committee, immediately following his death, sounds like the perfect setting for a political satire, then you would be right. Armando Iannucci's film manages to take a distinctly dark period in history, and reenact it, with an immaculate balance of horror and comedy.It is a success in three key areas - firstly, the writing - despite how the trailer is cut, this is not in any way a farce. The comedy is subtle, with jokes taking time to hit their punchlines, often many scenes down the line, which makes the payoff all the more effective. The second element in it's accomplishment, does really counter-balance the first, in that the casting and performances are universally outstanding - it was a masterstroke to allow the actors to speak with their native accents, and not attempt to mock Russian ones, as it grants them freedom to hone their comedic interactions with each other and doesn't distract the audience unnecessarily.Finally, it is historically accurate - people were living in a climate of total fear, terrified of making any mistake under threat of imprisonment or execution. What the film does, is create this sense of dread, even among the powerful members of Stalin's central committee (who seem still terrified of him even after he is dead), and allow the nervous humour to play off of it. I think the best comedies always have this sense of trepidation balanced with the chuckles, and this is where the movie succeeds ultimately. You learn as you laugh, and although there are some distinctly dark moments throughout, the film never deviates from it's ultimate goal, of providing comic relief."
"122",4.5,"  Buscemi, Friend si Isaacs sunt incredibili"
"123",3,"  It was quite the dark comedy it was well done did I find it super funny no. But the movie, in general, isn't bad had some good actors in it. just not my kind of humor I guess still liked it though it did have a funny part here and there."
"124",5,"  The fact that ""Democratic"" Russia banned a movie making fun of an authoritarian dictator is ironic"
"125",0.5,"  Nothing funny about this - an hour in and I?d heard maybe one slight chuckle from a person the audience. I left after 45 mins. Baffled as to why the reviews are so good. Not particularly witty, or clever, just dark - the banality of evil men perhaps. Who knows, who cares."
"126",5,"  Gets my vote for film of the year"
"127",5,"  Very funny film - Russian generals with Yorkshire accents ;-) and even a little Chuckle Brothers moment! Watch carefully for the more subtle jokes too. Really enjoyable, I had not laughed out loud at the cinema for a while until I saw this."
"128",3,"  Nearly 3 and a half stars."
"129",4,"  Slow burner to begin with, but once the characters hit their stride this is as smart, and funny as I hoped for."
"130",4,"  i have been interested to see this as i live in the uk engels statue resurrected in manchester and there are so many commie lovers here lol and it was funny in places but more interesting and disturbing than anything bought some books for christmas on the rise and fall of communism so it will add to it. the film was a bit to quick would have been better as a series. strange that an ideology will last poverty, genocide and war and then get turned into tshirts. hopefully we dont get that paranoia here. worth a watch and repeat viewing."
"131",3.5,"  Started hilariously, ended rather slowly"
"132",5,"  Great film, go see it."
"133",4,"  A three and a half star movie pushed up to four stars due to the fantastic script. Armando Iannucci has a bizarre ability to convey political confusion and ambition with humour and intelligence. The acting was superb across the board, although I don't understand why Jason Issac's was so heavily featured on the promotional material.The only cons I can think of is the speed, which felt both drawn out and rushed. We saw all the build up of the political upheaval without any of the historically accurate climax. Basically, I want the directors cut."
"134",1,"  just isn't funny at all, and I sat through bad moms"
"135",4,"  Definitely one of the best films of the year. Very funny which proves you can joke about anything, even genocidal communist regimes."
"136",5,"  Amazingly funny, even with the dark topic. Want to watch it again and again"
"137",0.5,"  just glad it wasn't any longer"
"138",4.5,"  Great black humour with some shocking images of killing and killing lists."
"139",0.5,"  Culturally insensitive and distasteful. Nothing to laugh about!"
"140",5,"  Brilliant film. Very funny at times, offset by the frequent dark moments"
"141",5,"  Ridiculously good satire with an unbelievable cast"
"142",4,"  Super funny & incredibly cutting"
"143",5,"  Glues familiar elements togther to create something vivid and, at times, horrific. Splendid writing with vintage cast on top form. Tells us a lot about the end of Stalin's Soviet Union and even more about the inhumanity of politics itself."
"144",5,"  This was often very funny, which was quite an achievement, given the subject matter. I really enjoyed it."
"145",5,"  A modern masterpiece of satire in a great cinematic tradition of political satire. Great acting and sets and a huge number of laughs. Stand out performances from Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale and Andrea Riseborough amongst others. Whilst being funny it also offers truthful insight into a world where evil had become mundane and routine. One of the best films of the year."
"146",4,"  To the folk suggesting the film isn't funny, stick to Carry On Up the Kremlin next time."
"147",5,"  Sublimely, darkly, terribly (in every every sense) funny. And sobering. A work of genius."
"148",1.5,"  I only went to see this because of all the amazing reviews on this site!! Lasted an hour and had to leave - couldnt stick it any more. Sorry, but I found it boring and mostly unfunny. The 1.5 stars I did give it was for Rubert Friend who has to be one of the most brilliant and versatile actors around today."
"149",3.5,"  Armando Iannucci casts his dry sardonic eye over Russian politics this time with his adaptation of a French graphic novel depicting the power struggle that follows the death of Stalin and it is every bit as funny, absurd and horrifying as you would expect from the mind that brought us The Thick of It and Veep. As a fictitious reimagining with the British and American cast very wisely using their own accents (and thus avoiding any Russian caricatures here), there is more authenticity here than you'd expect and the result is an entertaining yet historical, and therefore quite educational, film that makes something that happened 60 odd years ago still political relevant and insightful today. Delicately balancing the humour with the horrendous reality that is living in Stalinist Russia, Iannucci's script is guillotine sharp and full of immensely quotable lines that are delivered by an inspired cast. The brilliant Steve Buscemi plays Khrushchev as a typically conniving Buscemi character while Jeffrey Tambor plays Stalin's deputy Malenkov as if Hank Kingsley has taken over The Larry Sanders Show. As for the British contingent, the group of comedic thespians is led by an indomitable Simon Russell Beale, the sublime Michael Palin who's perfectly utilised as the loyal Molotov; and to round it off, Jason Issacs's General Zhukov who storms on to the screen and totally takes over in the most arrogant and hilarious fashion."
"150",0.5,"  I must be living in a parallel universe if anybody thinks this is remotely funny. It is genuinely the worst film I have wasted my money on in years. There's no attempt to establish audience empathy for any of the characters, no historical teaching, and the topic is just too dark for the feeble attempt at humour."
"151",4,"  Loved it - dark themes but excellent acting by the whole cast - however standout performance from Jason Isaacs - brilliant!"
"152",3.5,"  It takes lots of skill to turn a big tragedy into great comedy"
"153",4,"  In the same fashion as films such as 'Dr. Strangelove' and Iannucci's own ""In the Loop"", 'The Death of Stalin' takes dark subject matter and turns it on it's head with slick dry comedy and a pitch black sense of humour. The film is held first and foremost by the brilliant comedic forces of it's actors. The talented performances in this film are first rate, each actor is remarkably skilled at bringing out the most humour without becoming too broad or over theatrical. Steve Buscemi gives one of his best performances in recent memory as the quick talking, weasely, but manipulative First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. Jason Isaacs plays Georgy Zhukov in an unexpected, but priceless performance as a masculine no-nonsense northerner.If you were expecting a historically and culturally accurate film, then you maybe confused as to why all the Russian characters have distinctive British and American accents, once you start to settle into the tone of the film you begin to understand why director Armando Iannucci has made this decision. In terms of tone it feels like a mix between 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'House of Cards' as odd as a mix that sounds it works excellently to create the absurd world that is satirising one not too dissimilar.The writing, performances and direction make 'The Death of Stalin' a film which whatever your political opinion maybe, laugh at the flawed and desperate nature of the characters, which we can all relate to in one way or another. While I don't have any real criticisms of the film, the film does not leave you on a high note, which is hard to complain about because of the subject matter, but for a comedy, despite all the laughs, the ending did make me feel quite low, however I think on multiple viewings I may grow to like it more."
"154",5,"  I saw this movie at a secret advance screening, and may not have watched it otherwise. I'm so glad I saw it, it was absolutely hilarious!"
"155",5,"  I studied Russian history and found that understanding helped me get a better grasp of the characters so ruthlessly exposed by Iannucci.If I would choose but one to read up on go for Lavrentiy Beria the Soviet Himmler who is even said to have worried Stalin."
"156",0.5,"  This film deserves a R18 as it is simply unwatchable for teens and kids alike."
"157",3.5,"  It's positioned as a black comedy but for long stretches is just so grim it's not at all funny, with the laughs coming as momentary releases from the tension; which, you suspect, is truer to the history. The performances are great, especially SRB as the odious Beria."
"158",4.5,"  Well worth a watch !"
"159",1,"  This film is NOT funny! I Don't understand why critics are saying it's the funniest film of the year. It really isn't. Don't waste 107 minutes if your life watching it."
"160",4,"  The acting is superb and the comedy is stellar, but The Death of Stalin feels somewhat artificial at times - and suffers from some noticeable instances of amateur filmmaking, which is a shame considering how masterful many elements of the film are."
"161",4.5,"  Personally I thought this was the funniest film of the year"
"162",3.5,"  I liked the fact that the characters were played as though they were running a Yorkshire village cricket team and yet they were running one of the world superpowers and perpetrating horrendous crimes. For me the humour at times was too close to the truth to be funny and it is the overall storyline that will stay with me."
"163",4,"  funny and quite dark, nice to see Micheal Palin in a film again :)"
"164",2.5,"  the theatre was sold out in Harrogate on TUESDAY. That I think sums this film uo"
"165",1,"  The only good thing about this film is that I went to see it at Everyman and could fall asleep in a comfortable seat."
"166",3.5,"  Armando Iannucci has become famous for his fast talking, foul mouthed political comedies The Thick of It and Veep, and this one sounds like it could be another jolly jape in the aftermath of the death of Josef Stalin in 1950s communist Soviet Union. However, there is a black, black heart at the core of this film that never really lets you forget the atrocities going on during this brutal period. Simon Russell Beale, Steve Buscemi and Jeffery Tambor are three of Stalin?s inner circle jockeying for position after the Chairman?s death, while Michael Palin, Paul Whitehouse and Jason Isaacs also pop up with Andrea Riseborough and Rupert Friend as Stalin?s children. There is a blessed lack of fake Russian accents, instead the actors largely use their own - although Isaacs bluff Yorkshire is more Brian Glover than Lucius Malfoy. As expected with Iannucci, there are delightfully absurd moments and lots and lots of sweary but hilarious dialogue. There is also a lot of implied and onscreen violence - the grisly fate of a main character who one minute is taking, the next, shot In the head and set alight with his ashes shovelled up minutes later was very disturbing. There are several scenes of ordinary people led away and just shot point blank in a totally everyday way, that shows this is a time of extreme violence and oppression. However, against this backdrop, there are many hilarious moments and the comic timing of the cast is excellent. If you sometimes feel uncomfortable laughing at Malcolm Tucker?s profane rudeness or Selina Meyer?s incompetent bluntness, then you might be equally disconcerted at laughing while people live under threat of imminent death, depending on the word of a corrupt politician. On the other hand there are fart and wee jokes so there?s that"
"167",4,"  Really good. Funny and classic Iannucci darkness."
"168",5,"  A brilliant film. This film manages to strike a balance between gripping drama and side-splitting comedy throughout; I think I actually cried twice with laughter near the beginning. All actors play their parts wonderfully and even though I was less familiar with Tambor as I was the other actors; he plays his ""lack of decision making character"" expertly. I am not a film critic and so I do not know what to say in professional terms other than please, PLEASE go and see this film. It is quite brilliant."
"169",3.5,"  Really liked the approach to this film. Very well written and a great ensemble cast. I wouldn't have liked to be in the Soviet government!"
"170",2.5,"  The everyman cinema in Harrogate wassold out for the film which speaks volumes for the film"
"171",4,"  Pretty good, some really funny parts along with quite dark moments in equal measure, would definitely recommend."
"172",4,"  By turns hilarious and horrifying."
"173",4,"  Whoever thought of turning the succession crisis instigated by the death of Stalin into a farce deserves to be given a medal and then taken out and shot; the latter, of course, being the mandatory fate of anyone who peers above the crowd in any way. It's an absolutely astoundingly funny film, even though you watch the bodies pile up and realize it really shouldn't be.The basic facts of the film line up with what I remember reading about the end of Stalin's regime. What's changed is that the characters inhabiting the space have been turned into caricatures, bringing the absurdity of the situation to the fore and scoring big laughs off the cravenness, greed, and desperation of the committee members. There is no real lead, although Beria is the chief driving force for most of the film. He's played as the utterly loathsome man that he was, and he's probably the least comedic of the characters. It's hard to make his cruelty and lust anything but vile, so they mostly use him for any jokes involving a complete callous disregard for life. Better still, they pair him up with Jeffrey Tambour's Malenkov, who's nominally in charge now that Stalin's dead but hasn't a clue what to do. He's one of the more sympathetic of the bunch as, while he's vain and stupid and indecisive, he genuinely doesn't like playing murderous politics. He just wants to be important. He's the most overtly comic character as his confused bumblings and efforts to maintain respect often intensify the absurdity of the situation.Also vaguely sympathetic is Steve Buscemi's Khrushchev. Out of a bad bunch he genuinely is probably the best man they have to run the state. While they do poke some fun at his pretensions to being a great reformer, generally the humor with him comes from his straight man in over his head routine, and his efforts to maintain his dignity while maneuvering to oust Beria. While by the end he's shown he can be just as ruthless as the rest of them, you still kinda feel sorry for the guy.Most of the rest of the committee are just names. The only real exception is Molotov. Man, he's a riot. At first I couldn't see why they hired the great Michael Palin to play what was basically a dramatic role as an eternally serious and loyal party man. Then the plotting begins and his eyes just light up with glee as he joins in the purge. As he says, ""Stalin would be loving this."" The other characters are all outside the committee. Most are minor, such as the doctors rounded up off the streets since all the good doctors have already been executed. The director of Radio Moscow is a similar example, although he's the main window into the madness during the opening of the film when Stalin requests a nonexistent recording of the night's performance and they have to rush the audience back in and do it all again to keep him happy. More permanent are Stalin's children. His daughter's there for the committee members to alternately woo and offer protection, while the son's there to throw a spanner in the works of any plan that gets formulated through his childish instability. The last memorable role is Jason Isaacs as Marshall Zhukov. He's a lot of fun. No nonsense and instinctively violent, he's probably the only truly competent figure there. Aside from a certain vanity his main role is to puncture the ego balloons that everyone else carries around like a prize. His intensity is surprisingly funny.The whole film is about the incompetence and selfishness of those in power, although unlike most such films this one is about brutal autocrats. Mostly the brutality is played for laughs, as in the scene where Beria describes the horrible things he wants his men to do to the first two men on the list but then hands the rest to the last man and says he can deal with them however he wants (it's funnier in context). But the film never loses sight of the horrors these men were complicit in, even as it laughs at the way they jump in fear at every whim of the tyrants. The brutal ending as the plotting comes to fruition is played as straight as can be and still seems harsh, even after all the laughs that led up to it. The rest of the film is funny and more than a little disturbing, especially in an age where absurd autocrats are making a return everywhere. They need to be taken down a notch and we need to remember both how absurd such posturing is and how dangerous pathetic little power-hungry men can be."
"174",5,"  With a definite smell of python this film snakes its way between varying levels of satire, dark moments to get you sitting straight again and plenty of laughs that luckily are nicely spread and consistent through the whole film. Better than I had anticipated. And admit was a tad worried during the opening scene when Stalin first spoke. Soon got used the the accents though. Brilliant."
"175",4,"  The Death of Stalin is the blackest of black comedies from the directer who brought us Alan Partridge and In the Thick of It, Arnando Iannucci proceedings with stand out performances from Simon Russell Beale as the conniving and vile Lavrentiy Beria to Jason Isaac's who plays Georgy Zhukov, the Chief of the Soviet Army but with a brilliant Northern accent.It is completely bonkers, think Blackadder meets Curb Your Enthusiasm and you're part way there. Could be a contender for comedy of the year!"
"176",5,"  Farcical and almost Python-esque in places."
"177",1,"  I did not find this film funny but I thought it was offensive and silly and quite boring. Also, distortion of history."
"178",1,"  shit movie. don't waste your time. zero star. weren't even funny."
"179",5,"  I went for the historical element, having not seen a trailer for it but didn't realise just how funny it would be. It makes light of what is quite a serious subject without really playing down but by effectively showing all of the major players."
"180",4,"  clever satire on the chaos, cynicism, paranoia, and cowardice of the Soviet leadership."
"181",4.5,"  Entertaining and educating. I'm no expert in Soviet history but this film seems to find a delicate balance between reality and commical exaggerations. Scenes that are immediately hilarious evokes much deeper feelings for those people living under that absurd reality. Would recommend it."
"182",4,"  Hilarious, rapid fire comedy."
"183",0.5,"  Not enough humour for get your through such a dark story, there were some light moments, it just needed a lot more. We left the cinema half way through..."
"184",1.5,"  Bewilderingly overrated."
"185",4,"  A peculiar choice of film to make but I'm glad that they did.Jason Isaacs channeling an angry Sean Bean is great."
"186",3,"  comedy spoof in the monty python style about the Soviet dictator Stalin. All he'll breaks loose after his death. some funny scenes"
"187",4,"  loved this film great acting great comedy go see!"
"188",2.5,"  Ok the dialogue and timing is sharp - but not sure about the tone. It is knowing funny rather than laugh out loud funny. Recommend people see and make up their own minds."
"189",5,"  You have to be alert to all jokes... As they come quick."
"190",5,"  Saw at Tiff. Very well made black comedy, great entertainment from a very skilled director"
"191",4,"  Saw it at TIFF - Touch longer than it should be, but all around excellent!"

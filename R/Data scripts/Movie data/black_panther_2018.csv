"1",0.5,"  Least favorite of the Marvel movies. WAY overhyped."
"2",5,"  Wonderful acting and writing really make this movie something else. The plot is predictable (good guy beats up bad guy), but it still deviated from the normal superhero movie. I actually was sad watching the villain die, something I've never felt before."
"3",0.5,"  TOO MUCH FX (HURT MY EYES) AND IT'S NOT MY CULTURE, I DON'T FEEL LEAK TO ONE CARACTER;"
"4",5,"  THE Best movie every"
"5",5,"  Just came from seeing Black Panther with my daughter. How much I LOVED this movie is an understatement. Overwhelming sense of pride just fills my heart. Going 2 see it again & again. THANK U Ryan Coogler and entire cast."
"6",4.5,"  A great movie, one of my favorite MCU films to date. I was able to predict some of the twists, though that could be in part cause it is a superhero movie. I defiantly look forward to seeing Black Panther in future MCU films."
"7",1,"  Okay, but very overrated."
"8",1,"  This is the most overrated and overhyped movie I have ever seen. I wish I wouldn't have come in with such high expectations but when everyone is proclaiming it the best movie ever, it's hard not to. I wouldn't even put it near my top 5 super hero movies."
"9",5,"  F A B U L O U S film!!"
"10",4,"  Great movie! The pace was a bit slow and the soundtrack was awful, but other than that, Black Panther was a great movie. Now it's time to get hyped for Infinity War."
"11",2.5,"  edgy not in a good way"
"12",5,"  Impossible to speak of ""Black Panther"" without hitting the key (and with all right) of the representativeness, the importance of this film for a part of the population that few times was protagonist .. represented of heroic form.Finally, the film raises these discussions but treated as just another part of the already extensive MCU, the film fits and excels in Ryan Coogler's sharp technique in the quick and didactic story set in a unique moment in American history the only one that defines the entire line of the film, the quest for tactile reality ... even though it is primarily a fantasy of Marvel superheroes. That has all his way of being, winner .. but here Ryan gets more polarized the jokes are punctual quick .. many comes from the relationship Shuri and T'challa in this brother thing. The movie has this sort of thing ""lion king"", loss of the father..the rise means the forceps of a new king..meio that without knowing the way forward before the challenges faced by this Wakanda..so rich and technological .. but closed to the world for so long. The other side of the coin that ambitions the throne Erik Killmonger, has different plans for this nation in dispute. A young man with thirst for revenge who does not hesitate to achieve his goals, with fury and savagery does not measure efforts in the ends that he believes justify the means. Villain, fanatic, terrorist ... he may be all these things ... but the origin of the young person who does not justify his actions ... is a considerable motor force ... he has the motivation the reason to be so. And Michael B. Jordan manages to convey this in every scene in every angry speech, every act of Killmonger ... sympathy would not say, but you almost understand your motives. The movie walks true, beautiful .. you look at Wakanda and see her pretty colorful, organic and technological .. something that could have been .. happened if they had the chance, if they had the power over themselves. You look at that look and smile if you imagine it there. The cast is also impressed by the commitment to truthfulness by the transmission of feeling, placed in each expression. I think from the moment that film could reach so many people, so many lives they wanted their performances to reflect on those lives. The importance of this film, perhaps in the history of the cinema so rich is small, but with whom he intends to speak and whoever is willing to listen to it will be very important and represent a lot. The politics embedded in it shows current..the conflicts shown..the fears and intolerances treated to a lesser or greater degree, are sharp and speak with this generation. Black Panther was created in the 60s / 70s, a time of racial tension, a black panthers group, and even today it is necessary and punctual. Preaching diversity, respect for the different and unity as if we were all part of a beautiful and numerous tribe."
"13",4,"  This movie was amazing. Mostly, Michael B. Jordan's performance as Killmonger. There was a lot of depth to him. He truly felt that he was the hero of the story. They don't make villains like that for every movie, but the ones that do are wonderful stories. Go see this movie. Not only is it a great addition to the MCU, but it shows that heroes are not perfect and villains are not always inherently evil."
"14",5,"  Action movies aren't really my thing, but I ended up really enjoying Black Panther anyway. I loved learning about Wakanda and its culture. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed myself this much with a movie!"
"15",5,"  Loved it! Solid film! The ladies...????????????????"
"16",4,"  This action packed film has good action, amazing cast, good pace and amazing world in wakanda only problem I have it's does copy bits from the first Iron Man movie but still check it out"
"17",2,"  No real humor, its way more serious then it really needs to be. I came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and subtle political messages hidden for me to find upon repeated viewings. Although it was over hyped and even if it was amazing it still would have been over hyped, but the hype did have a part in me thinking it would be the most incredible movie you ever did see. So my point is, they sacrificed humor for politics and yet i still dont get exactly what political message they were trying to tell even after 4 repeated viewings. Libral? Conservative? in between? I dont know, yet they sacrificed my main drive, humor, for politics i dont even understand."
"18",1,"  if you like CGI .. i mean so much CGI ..a movie dripping of loads and loads of CGI ...massive boat loads of CGI ...so clean looking even when cars crash they are spotless ."
"19",2,"  was excited to watch this with all the hype. I found it to be my least favorite Marvel movie. The poor African accents made it painful. It was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from Marvel."
"20",3,"  I know this isn't a popular statement - but in my opinion, Black Panther is only slightly above average, mainly due to its predictability. I wouldn't count it among the top Marvel movies, though definitely better than most of the depressing DC movies of late (Except Wonder Woman ofcourse).With the overdose of Superhero movies nowadays, its hard for us to be impressed lately. Marvel/Disney are smart to release this in Feb - a traditionally lull movie month, so this is clearly the top earner. Also, its ahead of the upcoming big guns in Summer."
"21",3.5,"  Reviewed 3.18.18. Black Panther has deservedly received a lot of press for its first of a kind casting for a superhero movie. And also for raking in a ton of dough. So the fact that it's the most nuanced of all the Marvel movies has flown under the radar. The blurred line between right and wrong has been mined to death in the comic book genre. But no other entry has so adeptly deconstructed the greater truth. Along with the topical storyline of nativism versus world building, Black Panther is the 'now' movie of the moment. Brave enough to make the antagonist the most compelling character, young director/writer Ryan Coogler sets himself apart. With Marvel perhaps running out of steam (and enough darn CGI already, it's a comic book movie, not a cartoon), Black Panther has raised the bar perhaps one final notch."
"22",4,"  Movie was amazing.Marvel never disappoints.Must watch."
"23",4,"  A massively important step in the evolution of the genre (and mainstream films in general), Black Panther is the kind of film with the power to change minds. And that more than makes up for a disappointing lack of originality in terms of action and plot."
"24",3.5,"  A colorful tale of the fictional, hidden African country of Wakanda. Wakanda is a wealthy nation that's maintained its wealth, not by profiteering, but by maintaining (and basically hoarding) its valuable resources to utilize for its own benefit. While this has worked for centuries, a small number of its citizens believe it's time to expand into international influence (probably social media's fault). Some citizens think the influence should be peaceful, some malign. I found this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous. Its car chases through the streets of South Korea, are, frankly, the most exciting and interesting, probably because this movie also happened to be released during the 2018 Winter Olympics, and 'all eyes on PyeongChang' and all that. Had they used the action to take us around Wakanda instead of S.Korea, maybe we could've gotten a better view of what this fictional city looks like from street level, and found the city more realistic overall. What we do get is a very well-suited (pun intended) T'Challa in Boseman, good acting, a good supporting cast, a well-rounded character in Killmonger, and a great character in Man-Ape. Man-Ape worked as a great supervillain foil in the comics, but it isn't until he's brought to life in the movie that he gains some extra dimension (that pun wasn't intended), making him better rounded (oops, that one wasn't either) and more fun to watch. Shuri wasn't like her comics counterpart in any way, but being a modernized citizen in a traditional culture, along with being almost a cliché'd geek techie, made her kind of cute, I guess. Killmonger is an interesting allusion. Now that the other Marvel movies have created a larger New York and a vast galaxy of characters and extraterrestrial civilizations, they're finally expanding into a bigger Earth, showing it too is full of stories. That's the most refreshing part of BLACK PANTHER. Dr. Strange touch on an expanded Earth as well, but went more into extra-magical-dimensions.This is a good introductory film for the Black Panther, and I can see a lot of potential in it the same way as the CAPTAIN AMERICA and THOR movies weren't that impressive until after looking back from their second and third installments."
"25",1,"  Was I supposed to be intimated or something?"
"26",4,"  Solid film. Great characters and plot. Some messy CGI here and there though."
"27",1,"  it was ok at the start and went down hill to the very end. I gave it one star just for the start of the movie , sadly the people that made it ignored the comic books 95% of the time when making this movie .very sad"
"28",5,"  An excellent addition to the mcu and to the superhero universe..."
"29",5,"  Had high expectations, and they were met. Really enjoyed!"
"30",5,"  Fantastic! It gets so much right it's almost unheard of. Every member of the cast shines like a gem. The world and characters are so rich and vibrant it feels like everyone and everything you see is as real and has as much history behind them as anything on our side of the silver screen. Even the villain is a robust and three-dimensional character who holds views the audience is likely to sympathize with, though he takes them to an unacceptable extreme. If you haven't seen this yet, go. Go see it. See why it's about to top a billion in sales less than a month from opening."
"31",3.5,"  I have been disappointed by a number of movies recently, which on a viewing do not live up to their hype. So, I went into Black Panther waiting to be disappointed and happily on this occasion I wasn't. To balance this, it's not the masterpiece that some critics have made of it but it is an enjoyable watch. The action pieces are great, the plot solid and though the characters don't match those of other Marvel entries, they are still likeable and do not fall into the trap of being overly clichÃ©d. The dialogue doesn't sizzle like other Marvel movies but it certainly isn't cringe worthy and perfectly fits the story they are trying to portray. The plot works well for the characters and world that the movie is trying to create and while not overly inventive, it is still a good watch. Overall, I am glad that I went to see this and hopefully they can keep the quality going."
"32",3.5,"  gREAT Superhero movie with An incredibly relevant and Potent Message and themes on race and equality. I just wouldn't call it %97 worthy, due to Fairly cliche structure and a Huge disappointment on behalf of the soundtrack, which BASICALLY just recycles trap beats and features almost no Kendrick Lamar throughout the entire RUN-TIME of the film, despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film's official soundtrack. The pros outweigh the cons for sure, but it's by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying."
"33",5,"  Racist white people on movies with a predominantly white cast and one (1) non white person, something which has been the norm for a century: [crickets]Racist white people on one (1) movie with a predominantly black cast, which takes place in Africa and still manages to get two white men in the cast: SJW bullshit, propaganda, racism, alienation (it's because you're racist and and can't relate to non-white people when POC have had to relate to white characters forever), etc.Just say that you are racist and go."
"34",0.5,"  Weren't the Black Panther's a terrorist group that promoted violence according to google? Crappy movie anyhow."
"35",0.5,"  Visually good but too much left wing political correctness"
"36",5,"  Not just an incredibly entertaining Marvel film (almost every MCU movie at least this), but also a culturally significant one. Everything in this film just soars: The cast, direction, visuals, soundtrack, message, etc. If any superhero film deserves a ton of Oscar nods it's this one. Marvel Studios continues their unbreakable hot-streak and prove that they can make truly important films in addition to ridiculously fun ones."
"37",3.5,"  Good movie; great choreography, fight sequences; magical visual FX, lots of gadgets (feels like #JamesBond); #Wakanda was well introduced; good villains, you can understand their motivations; good plot, drama, politic, but.... the film is decaf, without something really EPIC; Sometimes is slow."
"38",4,"  Par for Marvel. Great superhero movie. Not a great ""black"" movie, a great superhero movie."
"39",2.5,"  Visually a masterpiece, amazing costume design, CGI brings this comic book character to life with amazing imagery. Chadwick Boseman nails it as the central character Black Panther. The character must share ample time with green screen and other major battle scenes with Michael B. Jordan as Erick Killmonger his main rival.Wakanda is the home for T'Challa son of the slain king T'Chaka, who must take his rightful place leading his country. The council is a tribal group who advises and provides the backdrop to ensure the country remains strong.The areas where there is a certain amount of leverage in any comic book movies is the dialogue. At times I had trouble understanding what was being said. It also seemed to show the same close ups of the tribal council over and over as well as the ritual to become the Black Panther. It was tedious to watch and seemed like it was unnecessary. The action sequences made this worth the wait as the loyal Wakanda people battled the other factions led by Erik Killmonger changes the landscape to change the Vibrairum rich Wakanda to move to the entire world and kill all those who oppose.In summary great action movie with great scenery and a wonderful cast. Was it the best super hero movie no but am looking forward to the next. Keep pushing the envelope."
"40",5,"  If you like superhero movies, this is up there with the best of them. One of those movies where there isn't a dull moment and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Anyone giving this movie anything less than a 3 star rating, clearly hasn't watched this movie."
"41",1,"  Would give it 0 stars if I could. Worst movie I have ever seen."
"42",5,"  Is the best movie ever I would watch it again and again and again"
"43",3.5,"  It's great, but as great as other Marvel films out there :)"
"44",5,"  Cgi was bad in the last act. The plot was generic. This movie did not have good action sequences. And it was boring."
"45",1,"  Boring, predictable, uninspired. Characters are undeveloped, the plot line plays out like every other King of the Castle film, the superhero is an echo of Batman, the General/Bodyguard is annoying with her stupid duty aggression, etc. Just every other King film recycled."
"46",0.5,"  I cannot vote this movie, for some reason. Rotten tomatoes does not allow me.... many of these 99% positive votes are ""fake"""
"47",4,"  With stunning visuals, thrilling action, and likable characters, 'Black Panther' is one of the best films offered from the Marvel Cinematic Universe with its politically thought-provoking narrative."
"48",5,"  Best Marvel's movie in many years! It's more from the line of movies from Captain America, and technically it continues from where Civil War left. I was worried that they could make this a comedy like Thor Ragnarok, but thankfully was not the case!Great movie Marvel!"
"49",1,"  I walked out half way through. Boring, predictable plot combined with atrocious acting and dripping with transparent, tired and boring US-centric racial themes make this movie one to miss. Honestly, what has happened to Hollywood? Churning out utter rubbish for years and now they're, desperately pushing SJW themes in a vein attempt to virtue signal to the rest of the world despite them being hypocrites of the highest degree. Rinse and repeat - time to wake up and smell the coffee, your audiences are bored of it."
"50",4,"  ibhayisikobho enkulu kunye nabalinganiswa abanomdla kunye nebali elilungileyo."
"51",1,"  Visuals as far as scenery were nice. Special effects were sketchy in parts. Story was a real let down."
"52",1,"  very racist, shockingly so. would not see another."
"53",4,"  Classic greek tragedy meets the Klingons offer of warp drive. Very good performances throughout. Andy Sirkus makes a fine villain. Edged weapons work better than blasters again (thanks Star Wars). Problematic political system."
"54",1,"  Over hyped movie, with a dull plot that didn't do the comics justice. The actresses in the movie were the only redeeming quality of the film."
"55",3.5,"  A well-made movie with characters you care about. Unfortunately, if follows a similar superhero plot. Not a groundbreaking movie."
"56",4.5,"  Great performance,Excellent collaboration with history and politics,Fantastic visuals and By far the important Marvel movie to date."
"57",4,"  +Great performances by all the actors especially with Letitia Wright as Shuri and Winston Duke as M.Baku+The women are not damsel's in distress and are bad asses+Wakanda and the world building is really good+The more political movie differentiates it from other MCU and superhero movies and it really works+ The story is interesting and the character development for T.Challa really works+The music for this movie is phenomenal+ Killmonger is a really good MCU villain with an actual sympathetic backstory and believable motivation with a great performance by Michael B Jordan- Killmonger does not have enough screen time and it takes half the movie for him to actually make a presence- The action scenes apart from the casino/Korea are all bland and forgettable which is really bad especially for a superhero movie- The CGI is really noticeable and is absolutely terrible in the final fightMinor Nitpicks.The first after credit scene really should've just been the ending though it is understandable to end where the film began.Since this film is set right after Civil war, it is kind of weird how they brushed over T.Chaka's death"
"58",1,"  aNOTHER GENERIC marvel movie. But his movie isn't about superheroes, isn't it? Not going to comment on the race thingy, because color shouldn't matter? right? bEYOND THAT IT WAS A GENERIC STORY VERY PREDICTABLE AND NOT VERY NEW. OR FRESH.BLACK PEOPLE WITH FAKE AFRICAN ACCCENTS AND NORTHERN LIGHTS IN AFRICA DIDNT HELP."
"59",5,"  Favorite Marvel movie since Civil War and the only Marvel movie I've seen twice in theaters. Soundtrack is on point!"
"60",4,"  Good, very solid standalone entry into the MCU (even moreso than Guardians was) without having to shove the entire universe down your throat. Albeit not as GOAT/ground-breaking as everyone's making it out to be, for me, but there's still enough to thoroughly enjoy."
"61",5,"  Black Panther is an excellent film. It is about T'Challa who returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan give amazing performances. The screenplay is well written. Ryan Coogler did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and drama. Black Panther is a must see."
"62",5,"  Loved the movie from beginning to end. Definitely one of my top 3 favorite marvel movies"
"63",1,"  I'd hate to be the voice of dissent, but the impression I got from this film was as follows: producer's 5 year old runs up to him and says ""Daddy, I have this story, and there's this secret space city, and a cat-ninja superhero, and the Lion King soundtrack, and army rhinoceros, and magic crystals, and CIA agents..."" and the producer said ""Let me see what I can do with that."" Are reviewers afraid to pan this hot mess because of themes of racial injustice? There are LOADS of films that do that in a classy, watchable way."
"64",1.5,"  Very good fun action marvel adventure ending was not the best though."
"65",1,"  Not my super hero movie, unfortunately."
"66",4,"  Visually impressive, good character depth, a menacing villain, and a good message, Black Panther is another satisfying entry in the MCU."
"67",3,"  it was an ok movie not great. i like thor ragnarok better than BP"
"68",4.5,"  I can't say this is the best Marvel Movie but i't up there.The characters were intriguing the action was aggressive and the story was compelling. A must see in a good theater if you want the best experience."
"69",1,"  Another movie that failed to make me care about the characters and plot. Boring."
"70",5,"  Amazing!! Every actor made the movie the greatness it is. They all brought something different and unique that added to the movie and the audience experience watching it."
"71",4,"  As Marvel films go, this is not bad and satisfactorily introduces a new character for future enrollment to the ""Avengers"" franchise. The special effects were excellent. The Black Panther's suit and the fantasy technology generally was served justice. The back story of the character laboured a bit, making it slow progress initially but it picks up on the action front. A few political elements crept in but I'll leave that for others to make their own minds up on. As a stand alone movie, not bad at all, with solid performances but outside of the Black Panther joining the Avengers, I don't know if I'd go for another installment with this character as the main subject. Still, Stan Lee must be proud."
"72",5,"  Definitely the best MCU film so far! T'Challa is a powerful and complex character, unlike any other we have seen so far. The visuals and the Wakandan technology and culture were fantastic. Killmonger was a strong and relatable character for whom I felt real empathy. His motives were excellent. It was his methods that made him the bad guy. Best and most complex MCU villain so far."
"73",4,"  Ok plot, visually beautiful, very creative setting of what an untouched civilization could have looked like. Good underlying message that addresses angst that is felt today."
"74",2.5,"  Though the message they wanted to bring across was noble. The movie itself was a bland mix of Dynasty TV drama, Lion King, and Casino Royale with unfinished looking/poorly done CGI, Mission Impossible wannabe (lack of) action, led by a wooden title character. The only convincing acting was the disposable main villain who hardly appeared. Too many boxes on their list to check, yet none of the ticks hit their target. The costumes were beautiful though."
"75",1,"  Very cringeworthy movie with plot holes scattered evenly throughout. With the main protagonist and his family being an outright sore loser, outright distasteful movie and I cannot fairly say I did not enjoy one bit of it."
"76",4.5,"  GOOD MARVEL SUPER HERO FLICK AND GREAT THAT A BLACK SUPER HERO HAS FINALLY GOTTEN HIS OWN MOVIE!"
"77",3,"  A great setting, a good villain and a above average story makes Black Panther stand out from the MCU mess."
"78",5,"  Black Panther is definitely not the perfect movie, but it is definitely a damn good movie. It will stand on its own fine in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and leave a truly inspiring message."
"79",1,"  I'd rather watch reruns of the Lawrence welk show. juvenile comic book movies like this show you just how low this country's intelligence level has fallen."
"80",2.5,"  Good music, good story."
"81",1,"  This is an SJW movie. The basic story line is good, but it handled poorly with too many anti-white ideas tossed out to the audience."
"82",3,"  It's so good. But not great."
"83",3,"  Pra um filme de heroi, é otimo!"
"84",4,"  Very much worth seeing but not memorable or inspiring. Solid superhero story full of superior actors, brilliant special effects, good editing, and decent writing. Some minor mis-casting, some confusing messaging, and some poor dialogue detract from elevating this movie to greatness."
"85",5,"  High quality action scenes, well acted and well written. Throw in an on point sound track to pace the movie. True to the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs. Strong performance from Micheal B. Jordan as the antagonist really pushes Chadwick Boseman protagonist character to be even better. Great casting of women actors as strong characters with a variety of characteristics makes this another strong entry in the Marvel Universe. The story in Wakanda sets up nicely the coming of Marvel's mega team up movie Infinity Wars...!"
"86",5,"  Casting, Directing, Music , Cinematography everything about this movie marks it as one of the best MCU movies ever made. But on top of that rich depth of its characters and a story line that could be outside of the MCU makes this one of the best movies made period."
"87",5,"  I want to watch Black Panther again but after a day reflecting on the film, I'd say it's one of the best of the MCU and of superhero films in general. You get what you want like people fighting each other (and really well done one on one combat) but a lot of the great weight of the film that stands out is the excellent score and strong writing for it's cast of characters and their moments. Every character is a realized one and has an essential role and function that makes sense for the story. Also this movie proves you can have a heroic and strong main character and also have strong supporting characters - many of whom are women - who are equal to the hero without tearing down the hero. Black Panther is strong as the Black Panther sure but Okoye, Nakia, Shuri, even Agent Ross all felt like they played an essential part in helping Black Panther suceed and save the day by each having strengths that BP just doesn't have.Also Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains which is saying something since (contrary to what clickbait articles will lead you to believe) Marvel has many great antagonists. Ultron, Loki, Kilgrave, Nebula, Ego, but Killgrave differed by going a route with his character and motivations that I'm sure no other film studio has the stones to address. The movie addresses race and the repurcussions of history and how it affects the present and how people of the present all are figuring out what to do to move forward towards the future and the answer isn't so simple either leading to many of the characters beyond just Black Panther learning and growing over the course of the movie.Oh and aside from the last credits scene, Black Panther is simply a contained Marvel movie. It's not trying to set up Infinity War or focused on the wider universe - it focuses squarely on Wakanda and it's characters and while ultimately what happens in Wakanda could have a bigger impact on the planet, when watching the film the characters are so good and so well written and realized that you completely forget about Iron Man and the Avengers who are also on the same planet. They don't matter really which is kind of a breath of fresh air.The movie was like Game of Thrones in it's approach to politics as King T'Challa is the ruler of Wakanda and Wakanda itself is kind of a character. The film is about just how this country will carry on towards the future and what it will do about it's past as Black Panther and his allies and even enemies are at a crossroads at what to do. It's a damn good film."
"88",4.5,"  Great film overall but a couple of plot holes made the story seem just a little bit sloppy here and there. Won't go into them here so as to avoid spoilers."
"89",4,"  another fun Marvel movie.. a little off, very good overall"
"90",1,"  Sad, worst of the Marvel films."
"91",3.5,"  Black Panther (review) (nonspoiler)With the 18th installment of The MCU, The world of Wakanda is introduced in its glorious form after years of being teased since its first tease in Iron Man 2. The production of the film in regards to its visuals and aesthetics are truly breathtaking and deserve award nominations already. Costume designs and cinematography deserve high marks. I just wish the story itself was on the same breathtaking level. The plot and structure itself was predictable from my own point of view.The incredible performance by the cast helped bring the film's basic story to life which I found at times leaned into narrative cliches that are typical in the genre. The score was ok although nothing stuck out which is why the score is really an afterthought. The film's 1st act is a bit slow which hampers the film slightly. The second act was paced very well. The third act felt rushed which is typical of comic book films. The CGI at times was questionable,This is very apparent when seen in the third act. Overall, BlackPanther is a solid film released at the right time.My rating: 3.9 out of 5 ??"
"92",3,"  The visual effects were often subpar to the Marvel standard and were even irritatingly bad at points, the main character was not as interesting as his bodyguard, and the world building was poorly thought out. Why does the most technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears? or live in giant cities with dirt roads and thatch roofs? Not enough care was put into the details of the film, despite moderately good characters and some exceptional performances from the actors."
"93",1,"  Featured zero actual black panthers. Way too much CGI and a mediocre script."
"94",3,"  moST OVERRATED MOVIE SO FAR In 2018, terrible cgi, wooden acting from the main villain, cardboard characters used as extras, i seem this film was rushed, i give it 6/10"
"95",1,"  wakanda bullshit ,most overrated movie of all time,critics are scared to be called racist,pathetic!"
"96",5,"  The best superhero movie of all time!!!"
"97",5,"  Good stand alone Marvel movie with lots of action!"
"98",3,"  It's evidently just me, but I didn't like Black Panther. Boring, disjointed, and afraid to step out of his comfort zone, the movie just stumbles along without developing characters, providing laughs, or action. The movie plays out as if it's terrified of being good. Now, this is not to say it's a terrible movie...just boring. There's some messaging in their, but even that was steam cleaned before release. When a movie is based around a single concept but then dilutes it to prevent offending it's audience you're left with a 2 hour ""The more you know"" PSA. The cast was better then the script, and the source material better then the movie, but it couldn't break free of the weight of it's own hubris."
"99",4.5,"  Black Panther easily surpasses most Marvel movies of the past. The storytelling and the pacing of the movie are well done, and Michael B. Jordan as Eric Killmonger is hands-down the best villain the Marvel Cinematic Universe has shown on screen. Yet again, Chadwick Boseman puts on another great performance as the king of Wakanda, both in his emotion towards scenes in the movie, and in the fighting choreography. I thought, however, that the Soul Stone not being shown in the movie is a bit of a letdown, although I believe that the existence of the Soul Stone is shown in a clever way by Ryan Coogler, which in his first outing as a Marvel director, was quite clearly his best. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to all Marvel fans, both old and new."
"100",3,"  Black Panther is a sort of unique movie that dosent give me much of a ""marvel"" feel, but otherwise it has a good plot, emotional sometimes, and just everything about Wakanda is just perfect. The city has a good concept and it plays out well throughout the movie. T'Challa's history and his family's was interesting to hear too. This is a good marvel movie, but I'm more into the next avengers one"
"101",2,"  Don't, Don't Don't Believe the hype!An Average movie at best! Black Panther Superhero? Seems to have no real powers without his purple juice & suit. It's like being Batman or Iron man but getting your sister to do all the clever stuff. Without his Grape juice, he loses fights & barely wins with normal guys. With his grape juice he still almost loses. I wanted & hoped for so much more from this movie. Making tons of money & having lots of hype doesn't make it a great movie. As a superhero movie, ignoring race completely it's at best average."
"102",2,"  I'm sorry but this movie is NOT a good movie. Marvel's Avengers and Wonder Woman are far better than this piece of crap. The story is b e y o n d b o r i n g and there is like one cool car scene. I am so glad I didn't pay to see this overrated garbage."
"103",5,"  Great movie!!!!! Great humor. Great action scenes. Great social commentary. Great writing. Great directing, acting amd more. A must see!"
"104",4,"  Great movie. Writing, acting, and sets are amazing. Good storyline, although I felt the villain's storyline could've been stronger. By far one of the best Marvel movies to ever come out. End credit scenes looked intriguing as well"
"105",5,"  MCU in Its Greatness ;)"
"106",5,"  Another great movie Marvel, has me more excited to see the new Avengers!"
"107",2.5,"  All I can say is, meh. I thought Marvel was finally moving away from these boring, almost robotic movies after the ludicrously entertaining and refreshing Thor: Ragnarok and Spiderman Homecoming, but then this movie came out. This could just as easily have been spit out by a machine and there is barely any personality to it because God forbid Marvel say something potentially offensive about a minority. To me, the critical acclaim for this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of Wonder Woman last year. Message to all critics: just because there are minorities or 'oppressed' people in a movie, does not make it good. I'm sorry to get political, but I can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been judged by people thus far, so I needed to get it out of the way. Moving on...In terms of the script, characters, and film-making, this movie is just average. The characters aren't very well developed (what is Daniel Kaluuya's motivation), the villain - for all the critical acclaim he got - wasn't particularly good or well-developed, even though Michael B. Jordan was good in the role, and there are moments where you just ask yourself, ""Why should I care about this?"" I mean, it's not like Marvel could expect you to believe that the main character might die - he's in the fucking Infinity War trailer, for crying out loud! - or that any harm could come to anyone in the panther suit - they repeatedly explained that it was indestructible! I guess I'm just rambling at this point, but I don't feel that there is a coherent way to speak about the messy sludge that is this movie. Overall, the Marvel movie it most reminds me of is Age of Ultron - sure, it may have the $200 million budget to have decent special effects, but that doesn't mean that the movie is engaging or has any heart. To be perfectly honest I was bored at several points during the movie, and if I had had a watch I would certainly have checked it regularly. The whole point of Marvel movies is that they're meant to be enteratining, and this just wasn't to me. I know there are people out there who really connected to or at least enjoyed this movie, and you know what? Good for you. But I personally didn't enjoy this movie, and most certainly do not believe that 97% of critics did."
"108",1,"  another political correct shit"
"109",1,"  I saw the movie... not that good really.. i cannot understand why this movie is better than thor ragnarok. I still in favour that thor raganrok is the best movie than black panther."
"110",4,"  A very very good movie. The costume, the action sequences, the story, all were brilliant. Michael B. Jordan with a star-making performance. Utterly enjoyed it."
"111",0.5,"  Not that entertaining at all."
"112",2.5,"  Has possibly one of the best Marvel villains since the films began. Pacing is alright, costume design and lore steal the show. Action is alright, some scenes are incredible and others are confusing and the CGI doesn't do it justice. Acting is great all around, villain is the best character by far. Too many political and social messages put in to pander to that kind of crowd. One here or there would have been powerful and impactful, but there were so many that each one meant less than the last. Definitely worth seeing if you're a Marvel fan."
"113",4.5,"  An absolute gem of a film. From Coogler's direction and Boseman/Jordan at their best. Although it suffers from subpar CGI and a few cliche moments but that's few and far between. 92/100."
"114",2,"  I honestly don't understand the hype for this movie. While the cast is phenomenal, and the setting of the movie is beautiful,, this movie at best is an average Marvel movie, and a suckfest at worst. T'Challa might be the worst superhero of all time because he clearly doesn't care about human life throughout the movie, all he cares about is a resource that he supposedly owns until the villain shows up. And if that's not bad enough, he's character is just bland compared to his portrayal in Civil War. No nuance at all, his character just goes through the motions and does exactly what you expect him to do. His nation Wakanda is also awful. They are nothing but a bunch of rich elites letting everyone else in Africa starve and die. I guess this a commentary on how the government neglects black communities, but the parallels aren't the same at all. Plus when T'challa says Kilmonger is no better that the enemies, which clearly are suppose to be nations that colonized other nations, the movie is somewhat backwards in it's message because Wakanda is no better than it's enemies either. Sure by the end T'challa learns his lesson and begins a new era for his people, but it's only because the villain was right the whole time. Something which i haven't seen in a superhero movie since The Dark Knight.The villain is definitely the bragging point of this movie. Kilmonger is not only a humanized character that you sympathize with, but he is also a perfect foil to T'challa in that he is a physical threat, and a moral enemy that counterbalances T'challa throughout the movie.Whatever themes this movie was trying to get across were shoved down your throat until you asphyxiate, or come suddenly out of no where to the point that it shatters your suspension of disbelief. If you decide to skip this movie, you're not really missing anything except a great villain."
"115",4.5,"  This was very interesting, enjoyable, and a feast for the eyes. You could definitely tell in our packed(!) theater what resonated with people, and when.I was a bit worried going in about how much action this action-adventure might have. But now I'm thinking that the early critics who said there wasn't enough action really wanted a Transformers movie. In the end what I wanted more character development, more Wakanda, and more of whatever T'Challa is wearing. It's not that there wasn't a lot of that, I just wanted more movie. Also, I might have chosen to wrap up the final scene a bit differently.Actually seeing Black Panther reminds me that Marvel is doing their usual minor bait and switch in the trailers. Like they did with Thor: Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy, they're always explicitly telling you what the movie is about, or what the main plot is, but almost never showing how it plays out--Think of Hela catching and breaking Thor's hammer in an alley... that turned out not to be an alley. The trailer is just an appetizer, the rest of the courses do arrive when you plant yourself in the seat.In the end, the film is a definite recommend for Marvel fans, and even a recommend for those that always think blockbusters and action films are often a bit too fluffy and just about blowing things up. This is a well realized, new world on film, that may just suck you right in."
"116",3,"  OK..... FOR A MARVEL MOVIE.but really.... its nothing near 97 %PC STrikes again"
"117",5,"  Amazing fight scenes, perfect soundtrack, and a badass cast. Must see, then see again. And again."
"118",1,"  So bad. Words cannot describe. The only plus is I went on cheap Tuesday. It really is a rip off of lion king."
"119",5,"  Objectively the best design department ever"
"120",2,"  Fun action, slows down and got kind of bored. Worth a watch. That critic rating is completely fake though. no way this movie was near perfect."
"121",4,"  Overall good movie. I liked the action scenes. I really liked the African themed designs, jewelry, costumes and music (drums especially). The panther suit is awesome."
"122",4,"  Oh my Wakanda! this is amazing! Where can we sign up for a citizenship? Sleek effects, great casting and strong plot! Wakanda Forever!"
"123",1,"  What an over hyped crap of a movie. I wish i would never had seen this movie. Predictability and lack of solid plot is all over. No good action scenes. What a low release after an amazing Thor Ragnarok movie."
"124",2.5,"  It's sad that people are forced to over-rate a movie because it is socially important, when it should have just been made with the utmost care in the first place because of its great significance. There were some fantastic characters, costumes and themes but the plot was mediocre at best, dialogue was typical marvel corniness and I felt some of the remarks were more backwards and polarizing than progressive and aimed at diverse and equal representation. I think including certain dialogue actually gave people looking to dislike the film a somewhat valid reason to dislike it. Why couldn't this movie have been inscrutable so those voices would have no claim?"
"125",5,"  Great movie, great message, visually amazing, and at the right time. A superhero movie that goes beyond the action heroes to remind us what is right and what leadership is about. And Africa gets its day at the movies in a what if there was no colonialism, no forced diaspora. Featuring wonderful actors, characters, and costumes. Way to go Marvel and Disney. Not a white guilt movie. This is how you do it, Hollywood!"
"126",4,"  What more could you want? The plot is downright Shakespearean borrowing aspects from King Lear and Richard III. The characters are incredibly well developed. The acting is on point, particularly with Michael B Jordan. The humor is present, but never annoying as is a common trap Marvel tends to fall into. The film gives a perfect balance of the humorous and the serious. My only gripe with the movie is that at times the pace seemed kind of slow. It's only 2.5 hours, but it felt like 3. Other than that, it's an incredibly solid film, and is easily in my Top 3 favorite Marvel movies."
"127",5,"  Absolutely mesmerizing. Everything about it."
"128",3,"  Very forgettable, bad CGI, bad fight scenes. They took an interesting concept and ran it through the generic MCU movie formula. A lot of wasted potential here - I don't understand these critics reviews."
"129",3.5,"  THIS IS WAS A GOOD MOVIE AND RIGHT ON PAR WITH OTHER MARVEL MOVIES. NOT A TOP 5 FOR ME BUT STILL ENTERTAINING. THE ACTION WASN'T VERY IMPRESSIVE TO ME, IT WAS JUST OK. THE CAST IS WHAT MAKES THIS A REALLY FUN FILM, EVERYONE DID A GREAT JOB IN THEIR ROLES."
"130",3.5,"  Very good movie ! Great plot structure that flowed nicely. Only thing I wish they would refrain from in a sequel would be less political banter. I understand the reasons why it was used but it was excessive and distracted from the plot imo. The film would have been 5/5 for me if it was more just of a focus on the story and its awesomeness ! Great job overall :)"
"131",4,"  As with most Marvel movies, Black Panther is a great stand alone film and it's even better taken as part of the Marvel universe STORY LINE. The characters are wonderful and well developed EXCEPT the VILLAIN, Killmonger. He was 2 dimensional. His back story could have been the most interesting part of the movie, but it was glanced over. The context of his anger and HATRED was lost and he came across as just another VILLAIN with a monologue. Otherwise, it was a wonderful addition to the Marvel universe."
"132",3,"  Good but takes a long time to get going!"
"133",1.5,"  The Racist princess was only slightly less offensive THAN the philosophy throughout that no matter what African AMERICANS do they can't succeed, that THEY are not in control of their own Destiny, and that they require a super hero to bale them out. They don't. They are already powerful. They can already achieve their dreams, and they can already leave their youth poised for success, A ll they have to do is believe they can, and then make it happen."
"134",5,"  This movie is really great and I like it, it has great characters, great action Scenes, and a very good turning point!"
"135",5,"  Two words..Wakanda Forever!!"
"136",1,"  i dont really remember being thrilled maybe ill watch it again it was so boring i feel asleep even my girl friend said it was stupid and she is a very easy person to plesae with a movie"
"137",5,"  GREAT MOVIE. MUCH BETTER THAN THOR RAGNAROK, AND THE DEATH COUNT WAS A LOT LOWER."
"138",4,"  With blistering action, astounding visuals, and an icy-chill protagonist, this succeeds in propelling this seemingly perpetual franchise further into the future, but the ethical questions it so intentionally raises may have rather polarizing effects, depending on which audience you are."
"139",5,"  ""Wise men build bridges, foolish men build barriers."" -T'Challa, The King of WakandaAfter almost a month since it's release I finally saw Black Panther. Took me way too long to see it. I'm just gonna start out saying it really isn't like most of Marvel's other movies. It has some of the most interesting production design I have seen in a Marvel production since Guardians of the Galaxy, and the score really sets the tone and separates it from the rest. The hand-to-hand combat is something Marvel has lacked in recent years mainly due to the fact that many of their heroes, and villains have powers, and instead rely more on CGI. I don't have a problem with this, but I haven't seen fight scenes in the MCU this well choreographed since Daredevil season 1, and Winter Soldier.Without revealing too much, the villain was dope, and might be one of my 3 favorite villains in the MCU. You actually feel sorry for him, and even the film itself feels this way too. It also wasn't too reliant on referencing other films. With a lot of Marvel films, they love referencing things that have either already happened, or will happen. With the exception of probably 3 moments in the film, Black Panther stands on its own feet. Even if you haven't seen Civil War, or any Marvel movies, I recommend giving this a watch.Overall, this is a film that deserves all the praise it's getting. It really isn't ""just another Marvel movie."" It is something special, and in terms of style, and story it has a lot to offer to the modern blockbuster. Check it out!#WakandaForever ?"
"140",4.5,"  Black Panther - Review (2018)The GoodChadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther is once again fantastic continuing how great he was in Civil War.Ryan Coogler's Amazing Direction he is now 3 for 3, Fruitvale Station, Creed and now this. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is Excellent - He could of been a generic Marvel villain, but nope even though he has Sparce screen time, the second half of the film does a great job going into his past providing some extremely compelling, plausible motivations for his actions. Jordan's physical intensity speaks for itself, helping create a righteously angry character who is far more ambiguous and sympathetic than you might initially expect. Even though Loki might be the better villain, he Killmonger is a better grounded villain The fantastic Supporting Cast - Danai Gurira as T'Challa's chief bodyguard Okoye and Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri, while Andy Serkis hams it up for the cheap seats as secondary villain Ulysses Klaue, Lupita Nyong'o brings plenty of gravitas to T'Challa's love interest Nakia, and Martin Freeman is hilariously incredulous as Everett Ross.Winston Duke, who steals several scenes in the role of M'Baku (Man-Ape), the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe.The World Building of Wakanda is the best in the MCU that you want to see more from its rich and beautiful nation and thankfully we won't have to wait long to see Wakanda again. It Fully Engages With Real-World History & Politics with Michael B. Jordan's character even though from Wakanda was raised in the States it also firmly and bluntly addressing the continued ill treatment of black people in the present day. It may not be subtle, but sometimes subtlety isn't needed, and if you look at the major racial issues prevalent in the U.S. alone todayAs always for Marvel the humor is there and it works, but its not a joke joke movie, its humor works in many ways that's subtle It also feels entirely different than any other MCU film. The Visual Dynamic Action scenes are fantastic with Ryan Coogler's amazing directionLudwig GÃ¶ransson's amazing score and the Awesome Soundtrack produced by Kendrick Lamar The pacing feels great, nothing feels forgettable The post Credit scenes are awesome The BadThe Third Act while entertaining and awesome has CGI Overload especially when you see 2 animated figures fighting (its a small nit pick, but still)Overall: Marvel dominates again showing why they are the only ones who know how to do a Cinematic Universe well and doing it again this time with a Fantastic character like Black Panther.Overall Grade: A"
"141",2,"  Too much social/political messaging. Stick to what makes these films fun, the ACTION."
"142",1,"  It's better than Marvel's Inhumans!"
"143",4.5,"  Solid movie with its own feel and flow. WIsh I knew more about the comic as I was not as invested in the characters. The action was top notch and it had some interesting commentary on Wakanda POLITICS without being preachy. As the movie states, everyone is the hero of their own story."
"144",5,"  the best marvel movie ever! i am just speechless . i mean suspense action killer climax it had it ALL. no Wonder black panther rules not just wakanda but The whole whole marvel. it was awesome and i can watch it for a thousand more times"
"145",3.5,"  GOOD MARVEL FILM, BUT DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE. m B. JORDAN AND dANI WERE MUCH BETTER THAN LEAD ACTORS Lupita and chadwick"
"146",0.5,"  Just another entry in the MCU with cringe humor, bad CGI, and uninteresting characters."
"147",4,"  Well, this was very good. I loved the exotic world-building(Wakanda is gorgeous), the action wasn't obnoxious unlike the recent Snyder-infected DCEU flicks, the performances were good(especially Michael B. Jordan), and from what I recall there was never a truly dull moment. I want to see it again to see if it holds up, but as of now, this is one of the MCU's strongest, most unique outings."
"148",5,"  This was such an awesome movie! Ties for my favorite marvel movie ever. And man did it have a killer message that the world needs now."
"149",3,"  A visual appealing, albeit confused and outlandish, film that might as well have been high fantasy or set on a distant planet due it's alien technology, logic and morals. IT TRIES TO BE BRASS IN IT'S SUBJECT but really It is no deeper than what you expect from the glossy marvel franchise by now. And while it might have a strong lead and a fairly decent villain, it has many more hollow characters to bring down the level."
"150",2,"  Good visuals. But to. Much of a standalone picture doesn't fit in the mcu"
"151",2.5,"  I Thought there would be more? We waited a week to see it in the theatre, because I knew it was to be very popular. It was a good storyline, don't get me wrong, but we are avid movie goers. So when the move was over, I was deflated. BTW, DONTLEAVE EARLY! I thought that this was going to be like Avatar or dead pool and it wasnt even close."
"152",0.5,"  Overly political, not worth your time."
"153",3.5,"  Really liked this one. there were some over-cgi'd components, but the overall is great!"
"154",1,"  Very disappointed in this movie. slow action, disjointed continuity and relies too heavily on special effects."
"155",5,"  I loved everythibg about this movie! It was exciting, well written, well performed, well directed, important, engaging, stunning in every way! I cant wait to see it again!"
"156",2,"  despite all the noise, this is a comic book, made into a comic book movie. while it has some 'moments'..on the whole.. it wasn't very good."
"157",3,"  Fantastic Soundtrack"
"158",4,"  Colorful, noisy, highly predictable, but still - pure fun :-)"
"159",5,"  world building. CINEMATOGRAPHY creative visuals. LOVED THE SHOT IN THE THRONE ROOM WHEN THE KING WAS DEAD THE SCENE BEING UPSIDE DOWN WAS GREATengaging action BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THAT LAST ACT WAS ONE TO-HAND NO CGI LIKE CIVIL WARCOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THE STUDIO DIDN'T CUT CORNERS...THIS IS AN EXCELLENT START TO THE TRILOGY. Great work from Ryan Cooglerexcellent combo between Rachel Morrisons CINEMATOGRAPHY x Ludwig Göransson Score"
"160",5,"  Great movie and music visual. I love it ??"
"161",4,"  Did not expect It to be at its full potential since all solo movies are introducing themselves to the avengErs and moSt impoRtAntly the long awaited infinity war. HowEver, the storyline and production combined with the Great Cast has made this not the best marvel movie but one that can join the debate. Sequal will surely intRoduce the Independent storymuch better."
"162",3,"  Is it just me or are super hero movies starting to grind on the brain? This is not a bad movie it's just another variation on the same old shit!"
"163",2.5,"  Same story, slow pace and long fights."
"164",4,"  Black Panther is a fun and exciting Marvel work that breaks from the recent blandness coming from Marvel Studios. It has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists I did not expect. There were parts I had some issues with, such as Forest Whitaker, but overall I very much enjoyed this film. The action scenes and colorful images were solid."
"165",4,"  This is the live action Lion King movie I always wanted be never knew I needed! As I have always liked all the self-contained or origin movies the best so this one was another great and memorable one, steeped with so much rich African cultural influences and elements not seen in a film for a long while."
"166",3.5,"  Fun action flick. Nothing overly impressive and a tad too much CGI. Occasionally steps outside the Marvel formula."
"167",5,"  My favourite MARVEL movie of All-time. A+ predominantly black cast, well represented & story is SO WELL MADE! The action is on point, the music score is phenomenal and not too forced & great dialogue. Bruh I LOVE this movie! Best MCU villain as well. Broken so many box office records & now biggest MARVEL movie to date. Wakanda Foreva! 10/10"
"168",5,"  I went to see this with my family. We had a wonderful time watching a fanastic movie! Love the characters. The storyline and the costumes were fabulous. Black Pamther is awesome!"
"169",5,"  ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE IN 2018."
"170",0.5,"  Easy to find the bad guy Always behind it all., Like Chris Tucker said in Rush Hour"
"171",4.5,"  Is a good film but is the worst in this phase of MCU, at least is better than Justice League or Logan."
"172",1,"  THE SOCIAl media hype was really real on this one... this is a super overrated movie. Worst of all marvel superheroes movies."
"173",1.5,"  One of the weaker Marvel movies. Massive pacing issues, bad script and wasted actors in several minor roles which they are highly overqualified. No discernible directing flair and the editing is weak to non-existent. Im pretty sure 40 mins off this movie and its sub-plots can be cut down, making it a much better movie. Several"
"174",4,"  And so Marvel finally make an excellent film. Essentially a Hip Hop Lion King.Strong female characters, a complex baddie who actually might just be on the right side. Limited action (which always bores me), but when done spectacular. This is a sweeping African epic.The tragedy is Black Panther will become a minor character in Avengers 6 now."
"175",4,"  A near perfect act?on mov?e w?th dull and cl?che wr?t?ng. But everything else ?s amaz?ng and the v?suals are breathtak?ng"
"176",2,"  I hated how the Kings-guard turned on Killmonger. Also, kill monger's plan was to arm all black people and destroy all the ""colonizers"". Really!?"
"177",4.5,"  Worthy of all the praise and criticism that it has received. Well done Marvel!"
"178",5,"  This is not just a great superhero movie, it's simply a great movie! There was never a moment where I felt a void of intensity which I would further define as a movie with perfect pace! This was especially noticed in the scene transitions."
"179",4,"  No, it was not ""MCU's most absorbing stories"". Even if the movie fails to reach new heights, it's still a fun and entertaining experience. 4/5."
"180",2.5,"  THE MOVIE IS EXCESSIVELY AVERAGE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE IGNORING THE NUMEROUS GLARING FLAWS THAT THIS MOVIE HAS."
"181",5,"  This was a movie that was excellent. I loved its message about true unity and how the 'wise build bridges and the foolish build barriers.' This is truly a movie for our time when we see extremism on the rise on multiple sides today.I also love history and how they wove ancient tradition into a modern setting that seemed natural, believable, and relevant today."
"182",4.5,"  i like the focus on Wakanda and African culture. The plot of the movie is not over-arching towards the whole Marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of Wakanda. The cast was great."
"183",1.5,"  I was hoping for so much more depth, but it was same ole, same ole. Snooze fest until the last 15-30 minutes of action. My kid wanted to leave the entire time, but he loved the end fight scenes."
"184",1,"  not up to the hype or even half of it. a 4/10 at best. worst marvel movie ever!!!!"
"185",2,"  Not bad, Not good either. Just another middle of the road superhero movie. Way overhyped."
"186",4,"  More than the sociopolitical climate off the screen that boosts its relevance, Black Panther"
"187",4,"  Marvel's most unusual film of its Cinematic Universe is big on world-building, empowerment, strong (female) characters and jabs at the current state of the world. All that mixed with the ingredients of a blockbuster film, a great cast, good humorous timing and spectacular set pieces makes for a very entertaining ride that works as a standalone film as well as part of the bigger picture. Sure, some of the action scenes might have looked even better with stunt people instead of CGI fighters, but the wonderful production design more than makes up for it. The right movie at the right time and more proof that Marvel is far from being a one trick pony."
"188",3.5,"  Let's get something straight, right off the bat. This was going to be huge, no matter where you stood. After all the hyperbole and media attention and passive-aggressive social media infighting, this movie struck a cord that is both surprising and quite obvious. Black Panther is the lore rich and spectacle-driven extravaganza that was promised. But it also gives a strong narrative and deep characters to anchor the experience. No, Black Panther is not the first superhero film helmed by a person of African descent. The media tends to forget that Blade and its sequels happened and yeah that's a bit upsetting considering what it did for the genre. But there's no getting around it - a big budget picture on this scale with an all-black cast is new and unique.Picking up from his introduction in Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa returns home to ascend the throne of Wakanda. The isolated, wealthy, and powerful nation thrives by its use of vibranium, which the country mines and hordes for its own use. Though there may be others who desire both the vibranium and the throne of Wakanda itself for greater ambitions... Chadwick Boseman always brings his best to the screen and he has been one of my favorites since his criminally underwatched turn in Get Up (which you should totally watch when you have the chance). His Black Panther is a refreshing change from many Marvel/Disney heroes - instead of hammy, sarcastic bluster, he keeps cool and calm and the bullshit to a minimum. There are also a number of excellent supporting female characters that impress with Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright leading the way. A friend of mine pointed out that Black Panther actually succeeds better at feminism than The Last Jedi, which tried to make that a central theme of the new sequel trilogy. Black Panther's female warriors and scientists are tough, hard-as-nails, and do their fucking job. You have to give credit where it's due. Of course, Black Panther has a worthy adversary in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, a pretender to the throne who wishes to end Wakanda's isolation and use its vibranium as a weapon in a new war that would allow persons of African descent to subjugate the world. T'Challa opposes this and wishes to change the world via public outreach and scientific exchange. These opposing worldviews call to mind the dynamic between Charles Xavier and Magneto and it is a comparison that Jordan has openly invited.Black Panther is not quite perfect, to be fair. The special effects in the third act look a bit cheap and dated. (Think 2005.) A few of the action sequences, such as the car chase, go on for too long and the CGI Rhinos were pretty fucking stupid and felt out of place. And I'm not quite sure if I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and call this the best standalone MCU movie ever - even recent entries such as Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 have a bit more oomph, but then again, those are ""bigger and better"" sequels and may not be entirely congruous. I look forward to seeing a similar sequel to Black Panther, so you should go ahead and take that as a recommendation. It certainly lands in the better half of the MCU. It may be important to note that the success of Black Panther has outsized implications for the entertainment industry at large. Movies will now be marketed to a more diverse group of demographics. But more personally to a large chunk of the international population, this was a movie for THEM and not what Hollywood usually hunts (i.e. guys who look like me.) And that's probably for the best."
"189",0.5,"  the Most OVERRATED movie of our time. RT is noth bit poIson"
"190",4.5,"  The themes explored (different perspectives on the black experience, especially) make this the perfect first black superhero film. Note: Blade was a comic book movie, yes - but not a superhero film or with the breadth of this black cast)"
"191",4,"  Good movie. I don't know if it lived up to the ""hype"", but I enjoyed it. It didn't feel exactly like any other MCU movie. In other words, it wasn't too formulaic. Personally, I liked Michael B. Jordan as the villain, and I related his character (which isn't common for villains in the MCU). And action? I thought there was enough, but maybe some critics were wanting some more. One of the reasons that I'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because I felt it was a little too long for what they were trying to do. But, overall, I had a great time, and I can't wait until the sequel comes out."
"192",5,"  Absolutely Phenomenal"
"193",1,"  I tried, but it's just aNOTHer superhero movie. FLUSH!"
"194",5,"  Something else to say the least. I've seen it four times so far."
"195",4,"  At the moment of this writing Black Panther is the highest rated superhero film of all time (on Rotten Tomatoes.) It certianly lives up to the hype. BP is a terrific film, with tremendous actors. Chadwick Boseman is terrific. the women of this film are amazing. Lupita is probably the strongest ""love interest"" we've ever had in the MCU, certainly since Peggy Carter. But it's Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira, who surprise us in the best way possible with their performances. The ageless Angela Bassett does a marvelous job.  Michael B. Jordan is a good villain. I don't know if he's as amazing as the critics think, but he was very good. This continues Marvel's hot steak of exellence. - Let's face it, if the weakest Phase 3 film is Guardians of the Galaxy 2, then you must be doing something right."
"196",4,"  More character development than the typical superhero movie."
"197",2,"  the story is so b o r i n g. marvel studio is ruining the future of superheros movies"
"198",1.5,"  redundant marvel formula coupled with 90's cgi, bland acting, and poor script writing make a potentially excellent film insultingly unacceptable. if you want blacksploitation, consider car wash, coffy, superfly, blackula, shaft, or bucktown."
"199",0.5,"  Over hyped, same old movie with identity of the characters emphasised over talent, story and script."
"200",4,"  It's thought-provoking, action packed and unique in themes & style - however lacking an intriguing plot, holding it from being a spectacle."
"201",5,"  THE QUALITY and importance of this movie cannot be underestimated"
"202",3.5,"  Another decent entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A interesting blend of James Bond, Game of Thrones, and Star Wars.It does nothing revolutionary, but offers the typical Marvel formula of big action, quirky humour, and likable characters, with a notably refreshing, more exotic locale. Falling in among the like of Doctor Strange and Thor in quality and memorableness.The movie continues shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War as T'Challa mourns the loss of his father T'Chaka and ascends to King of the African nation of Wakanda.You can tell that it is trying to relate to the issues brought up by Black Lives Matters and other racial oppression advocacy groups. It plays with the issues in the same way that Martin Luthor King Jr. and Malcolm X did over how to free people form oppression. It focuses on compassion and the responsibility we have to better the world as one people.Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa doesn't shine as bright as he could have due to his character's uncertainty of how best to act as the new King of Wakanda. As his performance is quite contemplative and subdued, he doesn't make the most interesting protagonist. Letitia Wright did a great job as T'Challa's younger sister Shuri, instilling some fun and playfulness into a movie of mostly serious personalities. Andy Serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as he plays the hammy Ulysses Klaue seeking wealth and taunting the good guys. Michael B Jordan's Erik Killmonger is the best performance of the movie with his character's righteous anger and bitterness of how he feels mistreated.Minor Spoiler Warning:If I had to list a complaint, it would be that the third act somewhat falls apart into a large brawl with many characters that you don't really feel much about. It steals much of the movie's elegance and style away for the sake of an unnecessary action scene. As well, one character close to T'Challa felt rather poorly developed to lead to their actions later in the film.All in all, if you like superhero movies or action movies, I would recommend seeing it. Not amazing, but better than average.Note: Depending on your memory, I would recommend seeing Captain America: Civil War before watching Black Panther. Possibly Avengers: Age of Ultron as well."
"203",5,"  Black Panther:Part cool demi-God Superhero, Part ""The Lion King"", Part 90s/early2000s Oakland: ""Black Panther"" is all awesome and much like Wonder Woman (2017) brings fresh perspectives to the genre and while may fall into some of the same ""tropes"" and has some questionable CGI and green screen decisions in its final act the story itself is so good and the character so engaging that one can forgive these nitpicks. ""Black Panther"" never lets on that it's even in the same universe as Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and the rest. Feeling as fresh as a movie 10 years into the ""Marvel experiment"" can. and this is the closest Marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years. Although this represents the first full outing for the Black Panther character (who made his debut in Captain America: Civil War), it's more of an ""introduction story"" than an ""origin story."" Coogler's approach is similar to the one Tim Burton used in 1989's Batman - don't waste the audience's time with a blow-by-blow description of how the Black Panther got his powers and what he initially does with them. Instead, tell a real story and sprinkle in the details along the way. It's a more satisfying method of storytelling that what we sometimes have to slog through with initial forays. As a result, Coogler's characters jump out of the screen - feeling as real and with as real a motivation as any have in the MCU to date.Everything about the design of the characters to the layout of the narrative seems to have been done with such a care and respect that it oozes out of each frame. A powerful story and driven by veteran direction pulling out emotional performances that we as an audience can empathize with. Much like his other works - Coogler has a really strong throughline in this film that carries his message of unity and empathy. All driven by performances that people can gush about for days. From Andy Serkis & Angela Bassett to Chadwick Boseman & Michael B. Jordan - everyone brings their ""A"" game. Black Panther is arguably the most audacious movie to emerge from the MCU to-date and has to be in the conversation when considering the all-time best comic book-inspired stories. Although the structure is rooted in the superhero tradition, the production rarely feels limited by that classification. It takes us to new places and sloughs off the generic label that adheres to many films of the genre, providing an experience that is by turns exciting, emotional, and funny."
"204",5,"  What more movies should strive to be."
"205",5,"  Humanity needs more movies like this."
"206",2,"  The movie was ok, but I am just not a fan of it. I think its because to many people gave it to much Hype."
"207",0.5,"  I hate to say it this way, but if this movie were to center around a white protagonist, black panther would have similar ratings to the first thor movie. the plot may not always be slow, but is at some points, so unenergetic, that it barely keeps you interested. the most sickening part to me is how the media/Coogler is using race and politics to raise this movie to a level that it's just not at, and have it surpass true Marvel masterpieces like iron man and winter soldier"
"208",5,"  Great movie. Lots of action and an interesting plot with some serious family drama. Along with some comedy that was not out of place."
"209",4,"  ENGROSSING AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING; BLACK PANTHER SETS A NEW STANDARD FOR THE MCU DESPITE SUFFERING FROM SOME OF THE SAME TROPES."
"210",3.5,"  They built a brand new world here like they did in Doctor Strange but maybe it's even better in Black Panther with these jaw-dropping smart techs. Every actor did a great job especially Michael B. Jordan who played one of the best villain in superhero movies ever; his motivations are so compelling that make you sympathy with him. The dramatic moments were touching and they are clearly inspired by The Lion King. Unfortunately, the action scenes are very very bad especially with the use of such poor CGI; the characters seemed as they were fully animated in some kind of a computer game. The major issue I have with this movie is the ending; it's so rushed and clichéd. I think the movie should have been separated into two parts because it ends weirdly, I feel that the ending came out of nowhere; it's very displaced. I hoped to see King T'Challa more stronger as he was in Civil War but they made all the women in the movie stupidly strong that their fight scenes overshadowed Black Panther's. Overall, I had so much fun watching this movie but I think it's so overrated."
"211",0.5,"  Its a very boring, bland, and awfully written movie. Im not the biggest Marvel fan out there but there are a couple movies were i had some fun watching , for example 2008's Iron Man. I will never understand how a movie so bland and boring can surpass one of the greatest marvel movies of all time."
"212",5,"  This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen ........................................................................................................................."
"213",4.5,"  Well done! about as perfect as a movie can get."
"214",4,"  for me it was a very good and very explanatory film, showing a bit of wakanda culture. I like the idea of ??showing the origin of the hero and his beliefs and the film shows just that. I just did not like the fight scenes because I could have shown more of the powers of the black panther"
"215",4.5,"  One of the best comic book movies to hit the screen. Do yourself a favor and watch this film."
"216",4,"  More interesting for the ideas it conveys than the action it executes on screen."
"217",5,"  A+++. This is the 1st movie i wanted see at the movies more than once. It is outstanding!! Black Panther has it all.... sci-fi, Action, Romance, suspense, drama, comedy, mystery. The mind that envisioned this movie is GENUS! Black Panther is epic! It is legendary! It is awesome and amazing. It's so good, I wouldn't dare bootleg it!"
"218",1,"  This movie was way way over hyped for what it was"
"219",1,"  most overrated, overhyped marvel movie till now and even Dunkirk was more diverse than this mix of a BLM fantasy, Spider-Man 3 and George Clooney's Batmansuit wit nipples..."
"220",5,"  Spectacular!! This is an excellent movie! I highly recommend that you go see Black Panther! It has a theme of doing what is right versus doing what will profit you the most. The entire movie was exciting, with twists and turns in the plot and a storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole film. Excellent movie!"
"221",4,"  o elenco e a construcÃ£o do mundo sÃ£o incrÃ­veis, mas o comeÃ§o do filme tem um andamento um pouco lento. O final parece um pouco corrido."
"222",3,"  A good to decent marvel movie. A solid B, 85% score. But definitely not in my top 5 marvel cinematic universe movies. Maybe 8 or 9. The story is good, but drags on, this movie is over 2hrs long, and feels that way. Very little humor, which is a plus, but also the fight scenes aren't great. Worth a watch though. But definitely not a 97% movie like the critics gave it."
"223",4.5,"  The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed."
"224",5,"  Black Panther is a great hero journey's story. Chadwick Boseman returns as the titular hero, and brings a king's gravitas to the role. Michael B Jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be out of place from a hero's. The stand out of the supporting cast is Letitia Wright whose Shuri, the little sister to T'Challa, is a playful nerd but when things get serious she will get her hands dirty in the action. Marvel has returned to its A game form."
"225",2,"  ok movie not the best iv seen. ill probs never see it again."
"226",4,"  In July of 1966, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the first black superhero to appear in mainstream comics; Black Panther first appeared in Fantastic Four and then Captain America, followed by a handful of others before finally getting his own run in 1973. A powerful and influential force in the Marvel universe, this character finally has his own film (not counting the 2014 fan film Storms of Carnage). Leading the way again, Black Panther is one of only a handful of black superheros to have achieved a prominent place on the silver screen, and it's been a runaway success.Black Panther is at least on a par with any of the other origin story marvel films, and perhaps does somewhat better, thriving on an established universe and reveling in the ability to break new ground - thematically and socially - with fresh characters, fresh environments and a fresh story.The film embodies the vision of Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote and directed. Coogler is both a champion of black empowerment and imagination and a comic fan and nerd in his own right; having also directed Creed, he was a natural choice to bring the project to life. This is perhaps most apparent in the setting of Wakanda, which embraces African tribal heritage and culture and makes it feel authentic and vital, while at the same time showing us that Wakanda is an educated, technologically advanced first-world country. Visual and production design has seldom been so strong in a Marvel film. The writing was solid, if somewhat predictable, with only one bit towards the end about sending out ships filled with weapons feeling weak; the character driven story was a fitting medium. Collaboration with Kendrick Lamar was a stunning success, as the soundtrack just shivered with African vibes and the occasional hip hop bounce throughout, nothing out of place and everything crafted with a wonderful attention to detail.The cast all performed well, and in an inversion of the Hollywood standard of racial inclusion a nearly all-black cast led by Chadwick Boseman and Michael B Jordan is fleshed out by token Caucasians in supporting, story-driven roles. Boseman is, without question, the outstanding performance in this film. No stranger to challenging performances, Boseman follows up three historical character portrayals with a role as superhero; while this seems like a freebie, Boseman brings real gravitas and dignity to his character, making it believable that this person could in fact be the benevolent monarch of a kingdom and not just a superficial quip-slinging comic avatar. Michael B Jordan's character started out being somewhat mysterious but slowly became less and less likable up until the very moment his history was revealed and he truly became relatable, his outrage and internal conflict palpable. Between the two of them there is a really interesting set of dichotomies besides just good guy/bad guy, down to the very essence of their characters; Boseman as African royalty and Jordan as an African American hip hop influenced bad boy.The supporting cast held up well, too. Lupita Nyong'o led a cast of great female supporting roles, and with any luck we'll get to see her as Malice in another Black Panther film. Andy Serkis shows his versatility as an actor, transforming himself into a vicious outlaw; in stark contrast, Forest Whitaker's mannerisms tend to take the audience out of the movie because despite whatever role he's playing he's still clearly Forest Whitaker. Martin Freeman's take on Everett Ross is pleasantly understated and appropriate despite his vaguely transatlantic accent. Of additional note, Winston Duke deserves mention for his performance in a minor but important role as the intimidating but sincere M'Baku.Beneath the film's spectacle of superheros and action pulses highly cogitative social undercurrents. While it would be very easy for a movie of this kind to become bitter and resentful with its message or overly self-righteous and preachy, this particular film manages to walk the line without falling into either thematic trap. The internal conflict of the antagonist is real and relatable enough that you can understand the resentment without endorsing it. From some of his lines, the animosity he feels for Europeans and those of European descent is obvious, echoing vindictive sentiments that have proliferated in America for years; however, the film has painted anger and hate as steps on the path to villainy and destruction. It acknowledges the issues of race in society and the accompanying bitterness without supporting it. Instead it offers the image of Wakanda and its champions as the path forward, suggesting without preaching that moving forward together to find solutions and peace is more productive than dwelling on ancient wrongs and feeding hatred. For a film to accomplish this subtly and without draining the fun out of the experience is a truly notable achievement and one worthy of recognition and praise."
"227",5,"  One of the best Marvel movies of all time"
"228",4,"  MARVEL MOVIE WITH AN AMAZING VILLAIN. BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE BY LETITIA WRIGHT. AS T'CHALLAS SISTER. AND OF COURSE GOOD ACTION AND COMEDY AS MARVEL DOES. THERE WERE JUST SOME LITTLE ISSUES WITH THE CGI SOMETIMES IN THE MOVIE."
"229",5,"  Exceptionally good at attacking the hero.Forces the hero to make choices.Competes with the same goal as the hero.Find out which is which."

"231",2,"  It was decent but didn't leave a lasting impression...The story was simple and not too complex. It wasn't bad. It wasn't AMAZING. It was decent."
"232",4.5,"  This movie was amazing just as important as wonder woman was last year."
"233",5,"  A bold, moving, and nuanced story. Soaring epic."
"234",2,"  Over rated. I think it was slowest most boring marvel movie to date. Don't believe the critics."
"235",3.5,"  Great movie, but didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.I was rooting for Michael B Jordan's character by the end.. He had so much swagger and presence unlike the hero. Some rubbish jokes.. but overall a greatly entertaining movie (dragged sometimes)."
"236",5,"  Black Panther has to be one of the best Marvel movies (Movie Period) that I have ever seen. The action, the story, and the acting were all top notch. The villain's motivation had substance, and it wasn't just some machine in the sky. I usually don't even do these reviews but since I know there were people trying to take the score, I thought I'd add a real review. Go see it!!!"
"237",3.5,"  I'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies, but this one was very well done. Chadwick did an amazing job as well as Michael B Jordan... some of the other actor/actresses were a bit of a let down. I would recommend you watch, whether in theaters or at home is your choice."
"238",3,"  The fights for a throne are mediocre. It is not as good as I expected"
"239",0.5,"  Didn't think it was good. Honestly, I am sick of these super hero movies, it has been beaten to death."
"240",5,"  This movie was great, the villain had a interesting message that made it intriguing."
"241",4.5,"  Marvel's formula extended to afro people with the greatest respect. Noticing strong woman characters as much as black widow and men's role full of sins"
"242",1,"  Took the kids, they were as bored as I was."
"243",1,"  It's not like it was Blade."
"244",1.5,"  Was way over the top in my opinion Story dragged on and full of bad acting"
"245",2,"  Definitely not the best Marvel movie. I was pretty pumped for it but about halfway through I was kind of bored. Also, the humor didn't hit for me. You wouldn't know it from the guffaws around me though."
"246",2.5,"  good movie...way too much over hyped by the media...can watch it once"
"247",4,"  Great story which really makes it stand out from the rest of the Marvel films."
"248",3.5,"  I really didn't think this film would be good as I didn't like the character in Civil War. But I was surprised. This film is really good. It may not be the best MCU film, but it's certainly a good one and deserves a watch."
"249",3,"  As a superhero movie: solid with some great elements, but also pacing issues.Taken seriously - plot and the Wakanda just don't make any sense. But we don't take superhero movies seriously, do we?"
"250",5,"  This movie far surpassed my expectations. I think it may be the best MCU movie to date. I think it transcended superhero genre though and was just a fantastic epic. The waterfall scene with all of the people together was beautiful. I liked all of the characters. Black Panther is a bad ass. I've seen it twice so far, and had no complaints. I even think it was better than any film that i saw in 2017 which is saying alot. Idk about Three Billboards, but besides that.... i don't know. Maybe it will wear off. We shall see."
"251",3.5,"  Solid acting performances turned in by the entire cast. A shame that the CGI didn't seem up to the same quality as the rest of the movie's elements. A welcome departure from what has become the standard MCU formula and it does most things very well. Still, one wonders how an advanced and enlightened culture like Wakanda's could have kept such an outdated concept like a physical trial to the death (or yield) to determine who is fit to rule. Seemed very out of place given the glimpses we were given regarding the rest of Wakanda."
"252",2,"  At the bottom of recent Marvel movies."
"253",4,"  Muy buena película, aun asÃ­ yo creo que viendo sus primeras crÃ­ticas te creas un hype mÃ¡s grande de lo que al final recibes, aÃºn asÃ­ la pelÃ­cula es muy buena"
"254",1.5,"  As marvel movies go, this is pretty lame. Average story, way to political and only 1 cool scene(car chase)."
"255",5,"  Awesome flick, I rate it up there with Winter Soldier as one of my all time favorite Marvel movies! Never a dull moment mixed with good acting and good story."
"256",5,"  Awesome damn movie, 3rd time seeing it!! Anyone who lowballs this movie on purpose , get over yourselves and give credit where credit is due!!"
"257",5,"  Best marvel movie ever loved ever second"
"258",5,"  Wakanda Forever. I'm getting my lip tattoo tomorrow."
"259",5,"  Wakanda Forever. I'm getting my lip tattoo tomorrow!"
"260",3.5,"  Good story , i like the characters , good soundtrack , they done good job...ofc is overrated by rottentomatoes :D funny...its a little bit cartoonish and i dont like this stupid jokes in every marvel movie"
"261",4,"  I thought you will take me to Coachella..."
"262",1,"  Pretty boring. Slow and uninteresting. Is Marvel losing its magic?"
"263",5,"  Best MCU movie ever. Period."
"264",5,"  Black Panther all I can say is one of the best Marvel movies I ever watched."
"265",3.5,"  It's uniquely satisfying popcorn entertainment, a triumphant trifecta of subject matter, talent and timing."
"266",1,"  OVER HYPED NOT WORTHY OF THAT 97% RT SCORE ????????????"
"267",5,"  Wakanda is a whole new world, full of complex and deeply developed characters which make it fresh and exciting. It's a lot for one movie though."
"268",1,"  Most overhyped movie I've ever seen. It was cheesy and most scenes seemed to drag on. Very predictable as well."
"269",3,"  Very, very overrated, not bad though"
"270",2,"  #BlackPanther Review: ?? SAVE UR MONEY.Super hero ( ??) Black Panther has got no extra ordinary physical strength ( even if he drank sacred black panther water TWICE ) ?? U.S trained army beat the shit outta him! ????? He relies on his artificial bodysuit power all the time. This movie should be called ""BLACK BODYSUIT"" . ?? he even had to trick the villain in the final battle. ( his final battle was so damn short ?? & overshadowed by his team mates lol )OVERALL I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING TO BRAG ABT IT ! ????? SAVE UR MONEY ?? LMFAO ??"
"271",0.5,"  N.B. ""BROOKLYN"" got 97%....the SAME as this hot mess? come on! I stand by my half-star rating and I continue to call critics out on their b.s.!"
"272",5,"  This has been more than a very entertaining action movie, it has stirred up the pot in more ways than one. But as a film, it is very very good, engaging, thought provoking, current, funny without being too silly, thrilling, gorgeous aesthetic, this movie could very well stand on its own without the marvel universe (you must watch to see what i mean). It got some flack for some reason, i don't understand why, but honestly, this movie is effing awesome, you frankly must go see it."
"273",4,"  Hats off to Ryan Coogler and Marvel. By far the best Marvel movie I have watched. Enjoyable throughout with an excellent villain to compliment our protaganist."
"274",5,"  While most of the plot is quite predictable - more so than other recent Marvel flicks - the story is still quite good and engaging. Despite being introduced to the character in Civil War, this film almost as an ""origin story"" feel to it, providing you with the history of Wakanda and who or what the Black Panther is and represents. In addition, the combination of old and new (African culture with future tech) is visually stunning, aside from a poorly-CGId ""waterfall scene"". Perhaps most surprising of all was that T'Challa is only the fourth or fifth most interesting character in the film. His sister, Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, steals the show with her wit and sarcastic humor; Danai Gurira is absolutely amazing as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o and Michael B. Jordan both kill it as their respective characters. While I found Thor: Ragnarok to be a better film overall, there's no denying the brilliance of Black Panther."
"275",5,"  Great movie! Disney did an excellent job. I've sent it twice already."
"276",3,"  Black Panther was a good super hero movie. But it wasn't a GREAT superhero movie and I'm having trouble understanding all the hype and flattery from the professional critics. Just to be clear, I love comic book characters brought to life on the big and small screens and it makes no difference who the publisher is as I have always read and enjoyed them all. Basically we have a movie here that is all bogged down in a Game of Thrones power struggle for who will be King of Wakanda. If that sounds a little thin for a A list Tent pole Super Hero movie, you understand my review of 3 stars. A lot of glitz, some great fight scenes. But the best fight scenes aren't necessarily the Black Panther. Danai Gurira (Michonne on Walking Dead) pretty much stole every scene she was in and had far more interesting and realistic fight scenes, since she did them without some funky super costume that the Panther never had in the comics. Not bad, but massively over rated. Puts me in the mood to go watch Luke Cage on Netfix for a better superhero movie and a MUCH MUCH better soundtrack. Imagine if that were all there was to Wonder Woman. Or the most recent Thor. Loki kicking out Odin and ruling Asgard was just one part of a much grander story."
"277",3,"  Fairly generic marvel movie with a bland script that is using other methods to gain praise."
"278",2.5,"  I wanted to fall asleep halfway thru. The villian (michael b jordan) i thought couldnt have been a worse pick. He did not fit and acting was not believable. The story line was drawn out on really nothing, most of the scenes were fillers in my opinion for what the real story line shouldve been. Nice visual effects, and the main character did a great job."
"279",4.5,"  This movie mixes aspects of action,grief and humor perfectly that you will want to watch this movie more than once.The backdrop of Africa is represented very well . The actors in this movie are perfect for their respective roles and portray their roles uniquely for example T'Challa is a reserved character while Klaw is a energetic character.I loved the background music of this movie as it perfectly connects with different parts of the film.The director who is known for Creed,perfectly showed why his film are worthy to win Oscars(Creed rings a bell).This movie is enjoyable and action packed till the end."
"280",4,"  Much of the CGI is subpar, but thankfully, Black Panther is deeper than its action scenes, choosing instead to explore the consequences of past generations' sins, in a powerful, yet tasteful manner."
"281",5,"  One of the best movies I"
"282",5,"  I want to note foremost that there is a campaign to bring the score on this movie down. This 2018, and this makes the power of the movie more amplified. I saw this movie twice in theaters because the meaning and the story was so moving."
"283",1,"  I'm not a big fan of the Marvel movies but was talked into going to see this because of the massive hype over the past couple of weeks. This did nothing to change my mind, sorry, just not my thing."
"284",5,"  One of the, if not the best MCU movie so far. As many have said, it really makes you think throughout it. Especially with the main antagonist, played amazingly well by Michael B. Jordan, who's ambitions while dark are understandable from how he grew up. Makes for not only an interesting clash of force, but ideals as the movie reaches its climax. If you haven't seen it yet, get on it! I'm already going for a second viewing, haha."
"285",5,"  I took my 9 year old son with me and it was amazing. The cast did a beautiful job. It was worth every penny"
"286",3,"  Good: solid acting, decent visuals. Bad: plot was confused, and main character was uninteresting."
"287",5,"  Black Panther has changed my expectations for the future of solo MCU films"
"288",4,"  Black Panther is quite an impressive superhero film and surely does increase the expectations for more to come. This 'marvelous' masterpiece was a perfect blend of humour, action, visual effects and a strong plotline. Chadwick Boseman portrayed the character exceptionally well and made sure that one could ""feel the pain"" of the Wakandan king. Michael B. Jordan gave Killmonger a personality, a character that surely does put him up there with Loki. Other characters were played very well but the one that does leave a mark is Ulysses Klaue. Andy Serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that if there is a villain that haunts someone in the middle of the night, it be the Master of Sound. While the movie was certainly a great watch, it was also, at the same time a bit of a cliché. The fact that this film attacked racism while entertaining even those who do not follow the MCU is very clearly a massive achievement. Ryan Coogler truly did do a magnificent job by making a very important political statement through the medium of this delightful sensation."
"289",1,"  To much Sjw influence in this film..."
"290",0.5,"  I'm sorry I wasted my money and didn't wait for it to come out on DVD. I can put it in the top 5 worst MCU movies bumping Iron Man 2 out of the top 5 worst MCU movies. Just above Thor 2 and below Guardians 2."
"291",4.5,"  Black PantherInitial Reaction: He has the Cowl and he's on the prowl. (sounded a lot better in my head).Main Characters T'Challa/Black Panther: He's a mix of Iron Man and Wolverine with a bit of camouflage thrown in. He's played by Chadwick Boseman Erik Killmonger: He's a soldier with a secret. He's played by Michael B Jordan.Plot Summary Things are going as usual for the people in Black Panther's city. That is until one of their most wanted criminals - a guy named Claw - shows up on radar and they have to go out there and take him in for justice. However, the capture of Claw goes really badly, and what's worse is that someone lese - Erik - shows up vying for the right to wear the Black Panther's necklace armor (that's a necklace that turns into a full suit of armor)SCORINGMain Characters I like these two a lot as the opposite sides of a coin. They both want the powers of the Black Panther for differing reasons. SCORE: 9Supporting Cast The rest of the cast is also well done. Sure, we've got the royal family, but every member has a quirk. For instance, there's the princess who could give Tony Stark a run for his tech money, a queen who has a lot of sass and wisdom, and the dearly departed king (died in Captain America: Civil War) who is the sage. SCORE: 9Plot It's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with a few nice twists thrown in. But some of the action sequences go on for a bit too long for my liking. SCORE: 8Originality This may be the first superhero film with a large black ensemble cast, but the characters have a lot of personality in them. SCORE: 9Violence Factor This is a superhero film, so some of the action sequences are really over the top. Heroes can get thrown all over the place and can fall great distances without getting hurt. But this one really pushes the limit. SCORE: 8Other Moral Issues This film doesn't do much with the racial issue (which may be a good thing). Instead it shows a side of blacks that needed to be shown. SCORE: 9Final Score (out of 60): 52 % Score: 86.67% Marvel does it again; now let's see what they do with Infinity War."
"292",3.5,"  Black PantherBlack Panther is a superhero origin movie with a depth that other superhero movie couldn't reach before. it's not just about a protagonist and the story, Black Panther also delivers an iconic ""fictional"" setting and culture that actually felt real. even though it can't escape the ""generic"" marvel movie stamp, Black Panther is still a highly entertaining movie."
"293",0.5,"  DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE Cool costumes, story with no depth, subpar acting. I needed more from the Panther."
"294",1,"  Too much hi-tech nonsense and bad ""lies"". Ok, movies aren't real, but this one doesn't make an effort to justify the terrible ""lies"" and falseness in combat, in technology, physics, choreography... It looks like a kid movie."
"295",5,"  Perhaps the greatest story ever told...the Bible, Talmud and Quran need to bow to this, the greatest movie ever made in the history of forever!! Run, don't walk, to see this movie over and over and over until your very sould bleeds Wakanda! This movie may very well save our very civilization! Anyone who says otherwise is raycissssss!"
"296",4,"  Con Black Panther la Marvel ha fatto un enorme salto in avanti, dopo tanto tempo ci offre un'opera completa, sensibile e profonda che ha molto altro da dire rispetto alla solita storia di un supereroe. Visivamente il film non Ã¨ male, presenta alcune riprese fatte molto bene con buoni effetti speciali: alcune scene d'azione risultano ancora convenzionali e non del tutto convincenti ma nel complesso intrattengono. Sono i personaggi e le loro interazioni la parte migliore del film, con in assoluto il miglior villain della Marvel finora, un personaggio super motivato che ha un ruolo fondamentale per tutta la narrazione e per il messaggio intrinseco di tutto il film. Sicuramente gran parte del merito va a Ryan Coogler, un grandissimo regista emergente che dimostra per la terza volta il suo talento, sia nelle riprese che nelle modalitÃ  della storia e della sceneggiatura. Per ora Black Panther prende il suo meritato posto tra i migliori film di questa immensa casa di produzione."
"297",4,"  ????any ""whyppl"" who have a negative opinion or comment about this movie.?????????It wasn't about y'all and it wasn't made for y'all; and how fucking sad is that really, that of the hundreds of superhero movies made 1 didnt cater to y'all fucking agendas or sensibilities. Get fuck over y'all self"
"298",4,"  With ""Black Panther,"" writer/director Ryan Coogler pumps a much needed shot of adrenaline and originality into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Though it follows the typical Marvel narrative structure almost to a T, the film stands above many of its predecessors because of its vividly unique aesthetics (captured beautifully by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison), its booming soundtrack curated by Kendrick Lamar, and its rock solid main cast--notably Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, who is one of the most charismatic and tantalizing comic book villains we've seen in quite some time. Other standouts include Chadwick Boseman as the title hero and Lupita Nyong'o as his ally/on-and-off lover. However, the true show-stealer is Andy Serkis, whose brief but mesmerizing performance as a psychopathic arms dealer is utterly unforgettable. Ultimately, ""Black Panther"" is an enormously fun movie that is by no means as political as many have attempted to make it out to be. Its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for Marvel, but that doesn't make them any less powerful in this bold, new context."
"299",5,"  Black Panther offers a rare blend of instense, exciting action with deep moral drama.. fans and critics alike will be debating their favorite heroes and villains choices for decades, because the choices are so real, so human, that they can be disagreed with and understood at the same time"
"300",4.5,"  (87/100)It was a pleasure to watch but a bit too predictable for my taste. I'm getting kind off bored by the genre I think"
"301",4.5,"  Solid well-done movie with only 2 things in my mind to question,(spoilers) one is I wish they hadn't killed both villains, I wanted to see more of both of them and second is I found Michael B. Jordan's performance a little over-the-top and not 3 dimensional. I mean the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't show much depth, instead he was huffing and puffing and gave off a ghetto vibe most of the time, which I know exists, there are people who are like that most of the time but from an actor of his caliber, in a movie like this, I expected more nuance and depth."
"302",0.5,"  It would be a disservice to a very worth cause to pretend it's good cinema just because you like the idea or the message. Nice idea, bad film."
"303",1,"  One of the worst movies I have seen since The Phantom menace or maybe Dick Tracy! Total snooze fest! Absulutly horrible ! Don't believe the hype!"
"304",5,"  LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT Watched it twice in cinema so far.. will watch it again soon!!"
"305",4,"  I love the MCU, but this. GG marvel, great cast, Very funny, and a cool movie, i wonder what it is like in 3D?"
"306",3,"  Honest review, Meh... for theater but good for DVD or StreamingI really like the main actor and most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job overall. The story was interesting overall and didn't feel like I wasted my money like Star Wars.For the price I give it a 3The problems that stopped me from a 5 star or 41. The CGI with the ship flying around during the first act really looked like old tech from 10 years ago. I'm not sure if it was the way it flew or the shadowing but it was off and distracting.. almost looked pasted in cheaply. 2. I understand that a tribe in Africa do have disks in their lips but to keep showing it was goofy. 3. The fight scene on the water fall when they showed them fighting close to the edge and where the Shaman spoke looked like a very bad green screen job and dated.4. Unlike other Marvel movies where they have fun and sharp witted humor this was dry and not really fun at all.5. Some of the fight stunts were way over the top and just too much... expected a little more since this movie was trying to be of a more serious tone6. They don't seem to have a problem putting down the US... 7. The white main bad guy's missing arm part didn't look right and when sitting in the chair you can tell he just had a green sock over his forearm... 8. The token white guy CIA agent didn't fit the part9. Hints of Racism against whites is not a good idea at all since this will be the main audience paying to go to this and is not a good step to try and heal overblown media sensationalized for votes racism in the US10. Many dark scenes that were hard to see the people no matter what color of skin they have and very hard to see when the Hero is wearing a black suit...11. The club fight scene was very blurry and out of focus. The camera moved so much that it just seemed like a mess and was hard to see the action for most of it.Bottom line: Worth a rent and maybe they could get better writing, director and CGI people in the next one and leave out the racism. Black people have been in top Positions in Movies, TV shows, Sports, Music, Science, Military, Police, Medicine for a very very very long time and I think the first woman in this country to be a self made millionaire was Black back in the late 1800s...so to act like this is the first is kinda stupid and too be honest doesn't help with race relations in this country at all. hope this helps"
"307",2,"  very average superhero movie. basic marvel formula and standard quality, but CGI is outdated looking. movie is also quiet racist towards white people."
"308",4,"  I am just an average White guy; I think this is just a pretty good Marvel Movie. But, that's what make it great, it's not meant for me. This movie made me like the thirsty gambler even more."
"309",3,"  Don't pay extra for the 3D version. There were few effects that made it worth the 3D viewing."
"310",2.5,"  Kind of a weak script,, just wasn't my type of movie. It was fair, but I wouldn't see it twice."
"311",5,"  One of the best MCU movies till date. And it doesn't feels like a superhero movie but a movie about a a different culture or a country that is highly advanced and rich."
"312",5,"  Top notch spy/political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the best villains that Marvel has put out to date. The entire cast is top notch and nail their roles, with Michael B Jordan's being particularly stellar. Marvel has a great product and they continue to churn out hits. I am slightly biased having read comics as a kid, but I believe we are now living in a Golden Age of Marvel come to the Big Screen. Excelsior!"
"313",1.5,"  Wow....so full of pushing agendas, forgot to tell the story. Very disappointing and a let down. Nice clothes, cars and special affects."
"314",5,"  Black Panther is the best action superhero movie! Black Panther presents a wonderful story and the actors are amazing! I highly recommend that you go see this spectacular movie!"
"315",4,"  I liked it, it was very good. A bit slower than other Marvel films but I'll definitely watch it again and look forward to a sequel!"
"316",3,"  Good movie overall and great special effects. Another marvel origin movie in the books."
"317",5,"  The greatest superhero movie marvel has ever made. Visually, sonically, and culturally unlike anything ever seen on screen. Ryan Coogler is an absolute genius and the cast are immortalized as the characters forever. See this movie more than once and celebrate it with others."
"318",3,"  It was ok. Way to long and takes to long to get were it's going. The main villain was great just sucks the get rid of him at the end would love to have scene him in future sequal. Golum aka Andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in any more marvel films. Bilbo Baggins was ok he did his role. All In all worth seeing. But dont believe the hype"
"319",5,"  Full of logical inconsistencies, unrealistic Hollywood glamour, and seriously un-affectimg. The only value I can see is for a future film class to give an award to the student who can find the most flaws in this pretentious failure."
"320",3,"  Honestly wasn't that good. I understand this move is a big deal because of the black superhero thing but it really wasn't that great. The dopey white character shot down a few ships and saved the world? really?"
"321",5,"  This was a incredible movie. With multiple lessons and meanings that describe how we need to act in this world."
"322",2,"  I get that the movie carried a message of sorts, but the harsh stereotypes should have raised a red flag to the politically correct pundits who gave this movie a 97%. The excessive use of hand-to-hand combat in a society that is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is OK to fight. Nice message to minority kids. The use of war Rhinoceroses instead of mechanized weapons also makes no sense and would be met with outrage if this were any other movie set in modern times. Why are they selling baskets on the street in what should be the worlds most advanced city? And why is everyone wearing pimped out versions of ancient African ceremonial garments? Wouldn't that be like putting modern Europeans in powdered wigs and colonial clothing? The plot is a little thin, too. For example there is the small matter of T'Chala being alive, which means that he is unequivoqually still the king, everyone except warmonger should immediately recognize this and the big battle at the end should have simply been the completion of the sanctioned fight for the throne. Oh, except that war monger murdered Zuri in cold blood, which should have resulted in an immediate tribunal. Sorry, that whole portion of th emovie was justs rediculous. Then there's the whole James Bond rip-off complete with a casino, remote controlled cars and Felix Leiter, oops, I mean Everett Ross, the CIA agent. All pretty trite. In the end, a movie that could have been culturally transcendental ended up being about an angry boy growing up and taking revenge on the son of his father's killer. Stupid message. Fairly stupid movie. Lately, all the Marvel movies look grand in the commercials but end up being about internal strife among the players. This one follows that formula exactly. Let's hope the next few are better."
"323",3,"  I always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie ,I've seen just about every one of them . Movie was a bit overhyped in my opinion, but the storyline was good .seen the movie twice and I feel 3 stars is a fair rating , excited to see black panther and guardians in the new avengers ."
"324",3.5,"  Watching the Black Panther movie made that 10% part of me fill with pride, my mixed remaining 90% didn't believe the fantasy. Watch what happens in South Africa 20 years from now and you'll see what I mean; having said that, I enjoyed the movie generally speaking, it has less action, I'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies, but I like all the different types of movies that are being made with super heroes in them, not everything should be pure action, the movie kept me entertained. Considering some of the small propaganda it sold to my 10%, at least it wasn't as in your face as The Last Jedi was and it ends up as the better movie in the process. Overall I give the movie a 7 out of 10, definitely worth the $5.50 I paid to see it and a possible DVD purchase in the future"
"325",3.5,"  Unlike other Marvel movies, this tackles social and historical issues of African Americans. Giving a soul of its own. A utopia in film for all minorities. However it lacks the action that I love in marvel films, and focused more on the story."
"326",5,"  Great movie. Top 5 best Marvel movies."
"327",0.5,"  Horrible. I never thought I would say this but, for the first time I hate a marvel film. Movies are supposed to be fun not another political arguement. Get off you damn high horse and leave the politics out of movies. if I wanted to hear more of this crap I would watch the news."
"328",5,"  I would take everyone and anyone to see this movie. The characters are great, the story is beautiful and is the best Marvel movie so far. Black Panther deserves all the love and praise."
"329",3,"  If you like African culture, then this movie is for you, otherwise you won't connect with the movie."
"330",5,"  not you're typical superhero movie. its not predictable and has a good blend of action and humor. overall a good movie. definitely recommend for a Friday night with friends."
"331",5,"  Smart, subtly and suitably edgy, and complex entertainment for audiences of various ages. Well worthy of the MCU superheroes and more.Loved the rich storytelling and myth-making. From the costuming to the sets and scenery. From the music to the technology. With strong females and strong males.Loved every minute of it. Can't wait to see it again."
"332",0.5,"  This was boring, recycled ideas rolled into a crappy CGI exterior. Everything it did has been done better in other movies. The definition of a middle of the road, mediocre snore-fest."
"333",3,"  If you like Marvel super hero movies, you will like this movie. It has the same feel as the other super hero movies. Plot and storyline are very good. The story and development of the villain are fantastic. Action wasn't as good as some of the previous Marvel movies but the significance, story and development of the Black Panther make up for it."
"334",5,"  Honestly the main reason I want to see this is because it's before infinity war."
"335",3,"  Overhyped. Set up for a failure.. It was decent. Not bad for sure, but not good either. I was prepared for multiple viewings, but I probably won't now. Enough people will see it anyways in support. The movie had extreme down moments, mediocre to bad CGI in some scenes, not nearly enough action, music was good but a little too loud over some dialogues, somewhat inconsistent character study (different to what we saw in Civil War), awesome villain and support casters, and thoughtful messages."
"336",4.5,"  This film is centered around the Black Panther (T'Challa), returning to Wakanda, and becoming king after his father's death. The dialogue is great, and the VFX is perfect! I give this film 95%."
"337",5,"  One of my favorite Marvel comic movies so far. Very colorful in culture, great story line, very well made, unique costume designs and talented casts. Must see!"
"338",3,"  Good characters, good story. Too much cgi crazy stuff. Also didn't like how much like iron man this black panther is. Black Panther was great with his physical and mental prowess, cunning like a panther. Seems movies try to make all superheroes ultimate powerful now. Worth watching, only average good tho."
"339",3,"  Eventhough this film was hyped by alot of people, I didnt like the film all that much. The film has a great opening and the as the intro finished, the quality of the film deteriorates at high speed leaving me dissapointed at the end. This film really saves itself with the great music and really likeable carracters. The film has an overused plot and ending, its too typical for a hero-film."
"340",3.5,"  Solid Marvel film, one of the better ones. I don't know why there are people on this site giving it 5 stars when they haven't seen it, leaving such reviews as ""Can't wait to see it, got my tickets"" - If you are doing that please stop, We need a genuine audience score to counteract the Critics who are now suspect after Last Jedi, please do not continue this absurd behavior or the site loses all meaning. If you are on the RT staff please take note that this is happening."
"341",2.5,"  really wanted it to be great but it doesn't meet the hype - just OK."
"342",4.5,"  Good movie. Likable characters and very original."
"343",5,"  BRILLIANT WATCHED TWICE`!!.AS has ALMOST EVERYONE I KNOW"
"344",3.5,"  Entertaining but can do with a little more humour and emotion, lame story, way overrated, inferior to Wonder Woman or Iron Man."
"345",3.5,"  I was fascinated with the film the first couple of hours but then suddenly started being a common super heroe movie, with bunch of CGI and people hitting each other"
"346",2,"  It's not a terrible film, but not memorable either. For a $200 million the SFX are embarrassingly bad in some places and I nearly fell asleep during the first half. It's on par with the first Thor movie and no way deserving of 90% and above. I'm honestly shocked it would get anything over 70%.This says a lot about critics being afraid to honestly review this movie. In particular all the comments about being a ""game changer"" and ""best super hero movie ever"". That's all nonsense. It's a mediocre comic book movie, that's all."
"347",2,"  No superhero actions. No superhero personality. Somebody trains in normal world and then comes and kicks away T' Chala and takes away the throne. Even the army of Wakanda, 4 of their top warriors had to fight Kill Monger alone and they got beat too. T'Chala fought Captain America and he fought well. I didn't like how Black Panther was shown."
"348",5,"  Beautiful film with an amazing story!!!! I want to watch again"
"349",3.5,"  While this film suffers from the same problems almost every Marvel does ( lack of a good villain, childish humor, and a less than stellar script), it does a good amount of things right to make it an extremely enjoyable watch. While it is far from being perfect, a great cast, good directing, and an engaging story, this is a fun film that will be easy to come back to."
"350",5,"  Saw it for the first time and i was blown away by the story and the visuals!"
"351",5,"  My Favourite Marvel Movie!!!!"
"352",5,"  Aside from the CGI, this film is pretty much a perfect superhero movie. A great story, excellent world building, fantastic cast, one of the best villains the MCU has ever had, and one of it's best heroes... instantly moves into my top 10 superhero movies of all time."
"353",0.5,"  I found it hard to care about a country whose existence made very little sense. If such a country with such recourses existed for millennia, world history would not be as it is today. How would the Atlantic Slave Trade have existed as it does in reality if such a material as 'vibranium' offered the possibilities it did? How would it be possible to hide such a recourse within a made-up boarder? Yes, Wakanda is supposedly mountain-locked, but I doubt the native people would have been unable to get in and out of the Wakandan region. Furthermore, I highly doubt they would want to keep such a material for themselves - if it is so amazingly good that it can fuel countries and heal people as it does in the film, why on earth would the Wakandan's not want to trade the material for wealth? They clearly must have and did, as 'Killmonger' (a terrible name that seems to have been thrown in for the sake of it, as this is still a comic-book movie) reveals that vibranium had travelled in the form of an axe-thing outside of Wakanda. Speaking of 'Killmonger', I am surprised as to the praise that has been given to such a character. I do not mind Killmonger's absurd racism, as characters - especially villains - should be allowed to have flawed opinoins. However, 'Killmonger' simply wants to take over the world with the ridiculous war-technologies created by Wakanda's princess (even though I do not see why an isolationist and secretive Wakanda would ever bother to have made such weapons. Wakandans would be facing no competition from foreign innovators, and so surely they would prefer to remain in stasis, much like Japan did during its isolationist period. The desire to cling on to backwards traditions, such as electing a King through combat, or even just a monarchy in itself, is seen to be held by the aristocracy and T'Challa himself, but this doesn't fit with the additional facts that Wakanda employs spies across the world and lives with gadgets only dreamt of. Are they involved and competing with the world and the times, or not?) because he tells us that he feels that he has been owed more from the world. If we are told of Killmonger's desires in one scene, rather than shown what Killmonger wants out of life through the way he lives it, how can he be considered a well-developed character? The idea of destroying the world isn't that interesting, either. I'm confused as to why 'Killmonger' wouldn't simply stick to wanting revenge on Wakanda for betraying him. Martin Freeman's character seemed a little out of place, as I did not understand why a CIA operative would voluntarily help out the Wakandan King, even though he is willing to make business with Wakanda's most wanted criminal, played by Andy Serkis. The problems with Andy Serkiss' character was simply his forced comedy - it made it ridiculous to believe that this is the only outsider to evade capture from the overly high-tech Wakandans for so long. Not to mention that I did not find any of the jokes funny. Of course, humour is subjective, but the comedy here seemed to mostly comprise of half-baked references to things in popular culture as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes. I may retract that last complaint about the humour getting in the way drama, as during T'Challa's talks with his father, he is uninterrupted in chastising him. This brings me on to my complaints about the Wakandan culture and the conspiracy about T'Chacka and his brother. The death of T'Chacka's brother was not as emotional as the film seemed to want it to be received as, because the audience does not know T'Chacka or his brother. Why should I care about the death of some terrorist who I do not have a connection to? Furthermore, T'Chacka's blunder in not dealing with his nephew was distractingly stupid - he could have easily had the boy killed or better yet, just brought up in Wakanda. He definitely know about his existence, as the Wakandan's seem to know everything when it benefits them. The culture of the Panther god is thrown in and unexplored, which begs the question as to why it was included. The ability to speak to the dead was not in itself a flaw, but I would merely personally prefer it if the film did not look at the beliefs of the Wakandans as objectively true. The princess directly says in a line to the Ross that Wakanda's achievements are not made by magic, but it seems like they truly are, as their God seems to exist without a shadow of a doubt. Wakandans are unchallenged in their world view, even though there is clearly room in the film to explore the shortcomings of the backwards society which seems to hate foreigners unfairly.Lastly, I'll say that the action scens were not satysfying, largely due to their lack of importance. The challenges for the throne of Wakanda had no stakes, as it was obvious that T'Challa would be king and that T'Challa would be defeated but not killed by 'Killmonger'. T'Challa is thrown off a waterfall by 'Killmonger' instead of being brutally hacked to death ,which is what I would have wanted from such a villain who has 'kill' in his name. Yet why would the film end without T'Challa fixing everything? This is part of a series of films, only really involving one important character - The Black Panther. Was 'Killmonger' going to replace T'Challa as The Black Panther? Perhaps he should have, but of course not. I would have hoped that in working with the necessities of having T'Challa as the Black Panther at the film's start and end, so that other films are not affected by the Black Panther film, T'Challa would learn to become a villain in order to rule over his selfish Wakandan people, who turn their backs on the world to live in their own fantasies. The film would have worked similarly, though this would have allowed for a more interesting character in T'Challa, who actually changes more severely from hero to villain. The bloodless nature of the action, as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me. One of the earlier fight scenes in Creed had severely impressed me, however I could not coherently take in some of the scenes with the Panther in the dark, and laughed out loud when one of the bald ladies supposedly had her throat slit. Also; spears are objectively inferior to guns, no matter what metal they are made from. I know it was probably supposed to be a joke when the lady calls guns 'primitive', but her combat prowess seemed cheated on screen, as she was effectively protected from harm by convenience and not killing efficiently enough to redeem such luck. Thus, watching her fight did not contain much interest to me, as I was effectively told that she was not supposed to lose a fight. Similarly, T'Challa was given so much technological advantage that there seemed to be little reason to worry about any of his fights. Thus, at the end of the day, what was the point of this movie? To entertain? That was hindered by the assurance that T'Challa will be The Black Panther for many films to come, and thus nothing too bad will happen to him. To educate? Wakanda is a ficitonal hodge-podge of African aesthetics (and even Indian ones, as to me it seemed that T'Challa was wearing kurtas and his love-interest was ineffectively wielding Chakrams. I don't know if these are also native to some African tribes as well) so I didn't really believe the supposed sincerity held within this comic book story. Oh, and the gorilla people living in mountain caves felt a little too much like a Tolkien rip-off for me - they even suddenly join in to turn the tide of the final brawl. Tolkien did not invent these ideas, but his over-use in the past century would make me additionally precautions in including ideas which can easily be found in his works."
"354",2.5,"  Overall an OK movie. The story was a little slow and I might even say boring. The action sequences really saved this movie. The car chase was awesome. The political messages are mixed. They say some things one way, but their society reflects another. See if you can tell what I mean. Kinda funny and I highly doubt it was intentional. Stick to making movies."
"355",4,"  When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here."
"356",5,"  I was nervous going in to see this movie after the last Thor movie (time length wise). However, I enjoyed every minute of this movie. I don't know how to describe it without spoilers, just go see it."
"357",4,"  Another success for the MCU!Really enjoyed this. I thought it had a solid story with great world building. Two really good antagonised in Killmonger and Klaw. I thought the CGI was a bit off on a couple occasions, but nothing major. There's no real weak character's in the film, I thought they were all pretty decent and overall I had a lot of fun with this movie."
"358",2.5,"  Hampered by inevitable fatigue, Black Panther rises above the typical super hero fare in context only."
"359",4.5,"  Black panther adds something new to superhero movies. It brings culture and deals with real world issues. The cast is fantastic and the villain in this is one of the best in the entire MCU. He is given a story that makes you feel for the character and at times I kind of wanted to side with his opinion of what the ways things should be. The visuals for the most part are good, at times the CGI gets a little more noticeable though. this film is more serious then many of the MCU but still gets in its laughs. tHis might not be my most favourite MCU, although it is one of them, but it is the one that i respect the most. Overall Black panther is a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for the rest of the superhero films to come out this year.9.0/10"
"360",3,"  Pretty darn good, not great. 3 leads were great (Chadwick, Lupita, and Danai). Had trouble getting over the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still relies on fighting to the death to decide which man will rule over them without question. Hmmmmm. Wakanda loses some respect there. The movie looks great, with very good actors involved. Not one of the best Marvel films by a long shot, but a good film that is fun to watch. That said, I did not enjoy the fight scenes much. They were a bit hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting. I thought they might fight like smooth cats, or like ninjas with clever fight moves."
"361",2.5,"  A regular run of the mill story with beautiful visuals. Acting is ordinary or bad.Nothing new or spectacular except the geography."
"362",3,"  This one started slow and finished strong. Loved the more developed villains. Much better than the typical ""I'm going to end the world"" super baddies in most of these marvel flicks. This one had some depth and reason ala Spiderman/Vulture. But, just took so long to get there."
"363",5,"  Best Marvel movie so far. I'm surprised I would say that after Thor 3, but this movie far exceeded it. Charming characters, amazing visuals, displaying the beautiful African culture, cool weapons and technology, the social obligation of a nation..this film has done an excellent job in all aspects. Now let's sit back and wait what Infinity war has to offer!"
"364",5,"  Absolutely stunning! The best movie I've seen in a really long time. I was mesmerized, and lost in the film like I was a kid again. I'll probably go to the theater again to see it. WoW!!!!!!"
"365",5,"  it looks so cool i want to see so bad...."
"366",5,"  Easily the most interesting as entertaining of The MCU films."
"367",3.5,"  This is one of those movies where you order the large popcorn big enough for refills, sneak in some bunch a crunch and raisinets, and find a good seat. What you won't realize until you're 10 minutes in is that you will have to pace yourself through that popcorn, because you won't want to miss a single frame. Though it's not the best MCU film, it's right up there with the homecoming of the friendly neighborhood spider-man."
"368",2.5,"  It was ok but not my favorite Marvel movie. Great scenery and good story line but not much action."
"369",0.5,"  High expectations thx to critics reviews, Marvel movies aren't my preference but this was a stinker. 1 star rating due to RT banning negative reviewers- come get me."
"370",4,"  Magnificent production values and breathtaking special effects highlight this more-serious-than-usual Marvel superhero adventure which has a definite statement to make."
"371",5,"  Excellent movie, not perfect but very good!"
"372",5,"  A refreshing super hero! Black Panther has humor, hero's and heart!"
"373",2.5,"  Anything that had to do with the journey of a warrior-king was well done, but it was sullied anytime it got too contemporary or inserted cringey jokes. I'd actually really love to see what Coogler could do with a straight fantasy story.For an MCU movie in 2018, the CG was way too inconsistent, and when it was bad it was real bad. The general design of Wakanda was great and the costumes design was good, but Wakanda did not feel like a living breathing place. It felt like maybe a couple hundred people lived there, most of which were the nobility and the warrior castes. They really missed an opportunity to convey to us in some way what life was like for the average Wakandan.Overall, overhyped and overrated basic entry into the MCU. They should have played up the fantasy and put more effort into world-building and CG quality."
"374",5,"  I don't see my previous review, hopefully this isn't a duplicate. I loved this movie, have seen it three times, and will likely see it again. I felt almost as strongly about Civil War and Thor:Ragnarok, but this one touched me on a deeper level because of the ""villain"". Michael B. Jordan put so much heart and HURT into his character, that it's hard not to want to take the hurt away. Not that his plan is good, you obviously can't agree with it, but you can understand why he's so angry. Shuri delivered some funny lines, but if you aren't familiar with some of the teen slang and a Willow Smith song, it may not be obvious. The CGI sucked, but that's so frequently the case with Marvel that it's almost a requirement. I loved the way women were presented as strong, and willing to fight and die for their country above all else. No movie is perfect, neither is this one, but it's really REALLY great!!"
"375",5,"  An absolute Marvel masterpiece. You truly couldn't go wrong with it. Everything about this movie is awesome."
"376",0.5,"  Let's see if RT shows my review this time. This movie was nothing but pandering to the division of the races. I was so turned off that I walked out and asked for a refund....didn't get it."
"377",5,"  Absolutely loved this film! Best Marvel movie, to date. So much to like about this film. Perhaps my biggest complaint, was why did it take so long for this character to make it to the screen? Why did we have to endure multiple Iron Man's, when this single film is better than all three (and the Avengers) combined? Great action, tempo and acting. No throw-away characters! The director was spot-on, didn't shy away from tough subjects, but wove a tale that was uniquely appealing to the entire audience. Excellent film, definitely deserves a Best Picture nod, when the time comes."
"378",4,"  Short of some characters, the ties to the MCU are not that strong. The in/end credit scenes bring some strength in. A bit of overacting, some expected (Klaue), some not (Killmonger). The twist in the story was great."
"379",0.5,"  ????? ??? ?? ??? ??????? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ??????.??? ??????? ? ????????? ? ????????!!!"
"380",2.5,"  Poor effects, lack of tension, a bland script, and a flat lead keep the movie from achieving any sort of merit with me. Not terrible, but worse than the standard that Marvel has set. Even ignoring trailers and videos, I was disappointed, and not satisfied with the bland, obvious political/social commentary in the film. Clearly just a product designed to cash in on audiences. The action lacked suspense and thrill, and the skill of T'Challa was incredibly inconsistent. The suit provides a complete crutch, and there's no suspense as long as he's wearing it, because kinetic energy (ie. bullets, attacks etc.) just increases his strength. The comedy falls completely flat, and is incredibly distracting from the overall image the movie tries to make. The music is bland and unfitting, with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of sequences that don't fit."
"381",4.5,"  This movie is a masterpiece in every since . Representing african culture in a beautifull way . It is a smart and political awate movie"
"382",2,"  Maybe all the hype had my expectation bar set a little high. Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie i my opinion."
"383",5,"  I've watched all of the Marvel movies at least 3 times, including the last Thor and Black Panther. Not feeding into the hype but it is clearly one of the best and is an amazing movie. Wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away that it is great. I'm still a Cap guy though but this ranks up there with Civil War/Winter Soldier. Can't wait to see Infinity War, hope its just as good or better than Black Panther. BTW, going to see it a 4th time next weekend aka MOVIEPASS baby!"
"384",5,"  Black Panther is a thing of beauty. What's really satisfying is that it is visual story telling at its best, and in my mind, one of the most engrossing and thoughtful action films coming out from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that breathes deep characterizations, fresh conversations and envisions new directions. Black Panther is fresh, unique and deep. Although the representation may be African, set in a fictional nation in Africa called Wakanda, the script is nuanced, multi-layered and transcends cultures. Black Panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a film that has a brave, convincing and intelligent script which offers a two-hour escapism into a fantasy world. As you leave the theatre, you leave with hope to walk strong in a troubled world, and be inspired to believe in a better future. The ensemble cast is nothing short of amazing: everyone unique, beautiful and talented. Marvel seems to always get its casting so perfect for its cinematic universe: always finding that very actor for that very role, so much so you can't imagine the character being anyone else other than that actor: case in point, I can't imagine Chadwick Boseman not being the regal and noble King T'Challa. The audience would be able to find visual catharsis in the story, especially through any one of the character arcs, men or women. Women would be inspired and feel empowered by the strength of Queen Mother Ramonda, the leadership of General Okoye, the spunk and intelligence of the teenage Princess Shuri or the idealism and independence of Nakia. Without a doubt, the big bouquet goes to Ryan Coogler - for his direction and screenplay - which borrows too from biblical themes of redemption, forgiveness, sacrifice, death and resurrection, and Shakespearean settings. Not forgetting the crew, indeed a work of artistry and great passion. The sets are a pungent of colours and simply magnificent - especially the waterfall coronation scene. Even the costumes. The focus on detail is simply astonishing. Phew. Without leaving any spoilers, regarding the antagonist Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan delivers some of the best lines of the film - which brings chills down our spines when we weigh how easily smart young people today are being radicalised, and how thin the line is between good and evil when the world falls into the hands of anarchists and fascists completely deceived by their misguided sense of right and wrong. Clearly, this film is a step in the right direction for the wellness of the future in filmmaking. This is a milestone, and a gamechanger."
"385",0.5,"  I am not a fan of most superhero movies, but I decided to see this one b/c of the hype. One of, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. I think it was made into tricking black people into thinking this is what they could've been had they not been colonized. Well, look no further than Liberia for evidence as to why that's false. Anyway, I won't be bringing my wife's son to see this again anytime soon. Peace."
"386",2,"  Decent Marvel entertaining effort. Lead actor not the greatest- rest of the cast outshines him. Critics are political pandering giving it nearly the same rating as Citizen Kane."
"387",2.5,"  After a solid introduction in Civil War the Black Panther is unleashed into the MCU with ferocity in the characters first stand alone movie. After losing his father through assassination , T'Challa must now take his place as king of Wakanda as well as its sworn protector.The fictional land of Wakanda has hidden itself away from the outside world. Fueled by an alien substance called vibranium, it has achieved technological superiority, and an independence from all outside influences. Thorough a quick history lesson from father to son we learn how vibranium came to Wakanda, and how tribal warfare eventually led to unity in the land. Although the tribal warfare never truly ended fully. We also learn of the source of the Black Panthers power, which I personally was a bit disappointed with. Chadwick Boseman reprises the role of T'Challa/Black Panther along with Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis who return as CIA agent Ross and the villainous arms dealer Ulysses Klaue respectively. New to the cast are Angela Bassett as the queen mother Ramonda, Forest Whitaker as master of ceremony Zuri ,Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia the love interest, Danai Gurira as general Okoye and Letitia Wright as princess Shuri. Also new to the cast is Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger. After the events of Captain America: Civil War, King T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader. However, T'Challa soon finds that he is challenged for the throne from factions within his own country. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war. For the most part Black Panther is a solid first entry into the MCU. One of the better ones for sure, which again owes much to the characters strong introduction in Captain America 3. But the run-time is a bit too long and at times it gets bogged down in dialog heavy scenes which slows the pace of the film. Boseman plays the part of T'Challa as a bit stoic really, almost on the verge of being dull. That does kind of fit well with his situation though, having just lost his father and all. He comes more out of his shell in the scenes between him and his sister Shuri which are a joy to watch. Shuri also being a tech wiz who builds and updates all the Panther tech, Im sure a scene between her and one Tony Stark would be a scene stealer in any film. Martin Freeman gets a lot more screen time than I would have thought going into it, but he does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world. Bassett and Whitaker do a fine job in their respective roles, but they have little to work with really. Whitaker get a little more to do which actually is connected to the plot. Michael B Jordan is great as the menacing Erik Killmonger, who although at least partially justified in his villainous actions has quite a radically different idea on how Wakanda should use its technology and advancements as it relates to the outside world. I could watch an entire film just about Killmonger.The look and feel of the film are quite good, although we never really get to see much of Wakanda´s inner workings. What it is they do. And it's just plain weird to see these towering skyscrapers in one scene and a straw hut in another. The music was at times offputting also. I know they went for tribal african sounds, and music , but in a high speed chase in Korea it just did not fit well in my opinion. They also commit some cardinal mistakes which always drags the overall score down for me, but going into it would mean heavy spoilers and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone. Some things during its climax went way overboard to where I was just thinking ""really, why did they do that nonsense"" . IÂ´ll just say DinoRiders and let you figure it out.I was glad I saw it in glorious 2D as much of the fight scenes involving the Panther was set in dark surroundings, and moving at a very fast pace. It was hard enough keeping up with it without the added darkness of 3D glasses. The 3D is done after the fact anyway, so like always I say steer clear of the 3D version. All that said, some of the CGI was utter rubbish. Especially the final fight scene.I was pretty happy with the film overall, and I am excited to see and learn more about the characters and the land of Wakanda. There is still some secrets left there , and Im guessing we shall find out more in the upcoming Avengers Infinity War where Wakanda features heavily. I wonder why ( not really )"
"388",0.5,"  this sucks dont watch it"
"389",4.5,"  Another superhero movie? nice! should be sight to see."
"390",0.5,"  Pure political pandering."
"391",4,"  When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, ""Black Panther"" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"392",3.5,"  A solidly watchable but ultimately so-so comic book yarn, which fails to grab despite its best intentions. Chadwick Boseman is likeable but fails to exude the star charisma required for his central role, leaving the heavy lifting to the supporting cast, in particular Danai Gurira and Michael B.Jordan. Only towards the end does the film find its feet and step up the excitement and emotion. Worth seeing but below par compared the the series best."
"393",2.5,"  It is good but not that good, it teaches tribalism. If you want to fix this world shouldn't we teach unity."
"394",0.5,"  same old same old junk think of something new marvel jesus"
"395",5,"  Most awsome movie ever"
"396",4,"  Wildly entertaining, brilliantly thought-provoking, and visually absolutely stunning, like any Black Panther solo movie ever has any rights to be... But still its not the ""be all to end all"" kind of ""greatest superhero movie of all-time"" that the whole world right now seems to be gushing about. Its most definitely not even a hundred miles near TDK or Spider-Man 2 or Iron Man (hell there's at least several other better entries in MCU itself!). Just my personal opinion: if you want a superbly crafted fulltoos fun enjoyable superhero movie this one is just that, if you're hyping it to be something much more than that then you'll probably be disappointed. I guess in the end it all depends if your skin color is black or not, which will likely give you an extra passion. 8.5 out of 10."
"397",5,"  A phenomenal movie with the proper balance of action and thought provoking struggle of the emotional and spiritual level, this is the most amazing super hero film I've seen in a long while."
"398",2,"  The storyline was slow, weak and lacking interest. My 5 year old was already checking his watch for the time after 15 minutes into the film. It was not worth seeing in the theater but wouldn't be a bad watch on Netflix. The film isn't terrible but it's the worst so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"399",5,"  One of my favorite Marvel movies. The design was nothing short of amazing. The characters were intense, and the chemistry was top notch. They managed to take a character I always considered a B-List character growing up and made their world amazing to venture into. The female characters in this movie were badass, without feeling shoe horned in for the demo checkbox. I really want to see more now, hope most of them make it out of the infinity war alive. Go see this movie at a good theater, it is an experience worthy of ticket price."
"400",4.5,"  Great movie...loved how they portrayed the villian, and how everything is not black and white, but more complicated then that. Would gave it 5stars, but I left wanting MORE action."
"401",5,"  With a superb soundtrack and great performances from Michael B Jordan and Danai Gurira, this, for me, is the most enjoyable Marvel movie yet. With none of the forced humour it shows stronger storytelling instead which keeps you gripped until the end."
"402",1,"  It just wasn't my cup of tea."
"403",5,"  Excellent acting. Excellent mise en scene. Excellent plot. It is wonderful to have a film that empowers women and Africa."
"404",5,"  Killmonger is the best villain since the Joker."
"405",2.5,"  Reverse Mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king. Love the woke defense of anti-immigration policy. Friendly white guy is a CIA agent, who also gets drowned out by a sea of gorilla noises made by black people(who wrote this movie). Killmonger quoting Mein Kampf and attempting to Anschluss all the black people for his ethno-imperialist vision was a nice dichotomy to Wakanda doing nothing. What kind of racist was this movie pandering to? Wakanda is an Natsoc utopia. Make Wakanda Great Again."
"406",1,"  Not really interested in paying for something the wrong people who do not understand who the black panther is hyping it up for political reasons."
"407",1.5,"  Just another boring Marvel film."
"408",0.5,"  Really dumb as Wakanda is fake and is based on Trump's ideals. Also not the first black superhero with their own movie Hancock, Steel, Blade Trilogy, Spawn, Blankman, and Metorman all play with black lead roles."
"409",1,"  Completely ridiculous while not being a comedy. Like all Marvel movies."
"410",5,"  Great movie, its a feel good movie."
"411",5,"  AMAZING!! ALL ACROSS THE BOARD!! Ryan did an excellent job! the graphics, the action, the characters, the actors, and the message was clear and just absolutely amazing! I would give this 10 stars if i could!!"
"412",4,"  Black Panther is unlike any other Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film prior. It's unlike any other super hero film prior. Yes, there have been African-American leading men in comic-based movies, notably Wesley Snipes' half-vampire-all-badass Blade. However, this is the first movie I can think of with this kind of budget, this kind of backing, and with this kind of ownership over its cultural heritage and the heavy burdens it carries.We last saw T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in Captain America: Civil War mourning the loss of his father, the king of the African nation of Wakanda. The outside world does not know that Wakanda sits on a vast supply of virbanium, the strongest and more durable metal in the world and the key to Wakanda's impressive technology. Under a holographic cover, Wakanda is a thriving metropolis with flying cars, skyscrapers, and next gen weapons. T'Challa goes home and must earn the right to the throne. However, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), a former top-level black ops solider, is looking for his own path into Wakanda and onto the throne. Killmonger teams up with arms dealer, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis), to force Wakanda to deal with being cut off from the world.This is a movie populated almost entirely by black faces, notably black women (more on that later), and they are given a mainstream platform that celebrates its multitudinous African roots and traditions thanks to co-writer/director Ryan Coogler (Creed). This movie is proudly black, which will rankle some on the fringes of society, as if celebrating one's own identity is somehow denigrating those who do not apply to that status. Black Panther is not an exclusionary movie because of its content and execution; this is a very accessible movie to a mass audience, even those who haven't been paying attention to every nitty-gritty detail in the previous seventeen MCU entries. There are only two characters from other MCU films that appear, one as a post-credits cameo and the other an officious representative (Martin Freeman) of the outside's clandestine organizations. This is a unique world isolated from the long shadow of colonialism. Wakanda has never known, to our knowledge, the depravity of the European and American slave trade. They have continued to develop uninterrupted by conquerors, slave traders, and the crippling aftereffects of racism. The Wakanda people could very easily be the conquerors themselves. They're the most technologically advanced nation on the planet and hide as a ""third-world nation,"" utilizing the ignorance of the Western world to its security. The world of Wakanda is a fascinating, awe-inspiring, and defiantly independent nation.The larger theme is over the responsibilities inherent to those with privilege. The nation of Wakanda is vastly successful by all conventional metrics. T'Challa must wrestle with whether to continue their exclusionary stance, ignore the plight of the larger world and say it's none of their business or engage with the world, potentially putting his own kingdom's peace and prosperity at risk. It's a simple enough theme and yet it has tremendous weight to it especially when you account for those on the other end of the Wakanda borders. The character of Killmonger is a direct reflection of this. His experiences in Oakland are not the ideal pairing with the luxury of Wakanda. Killmonger sees Wakanda's great influence as a way to protect beleaguered black citizens of the world and especially in the United States. It's a way to prevent more senseless deaths from black citizens who were slain as a result of the fear of just being black (a powerful example was Coogler's debut film, Fruitvale Station). It's a pointed political statement that doesn't get too heavy-handed (even though I would have preferred that). It questions the value of isolationism especially when suffering can be prevented. Killmonger works as a villain because you can understand his point of view. He goes beyond the need for vengeance. The wrongs he wants to right are larger and historical. Even Killmonger's last line really attaches itself to this theme. T'Challa offers him a way out but with imprisonment. ""No,"" Killmonger declines, ""My people were the ones who leaped over the sides of the slave ships. They knew death was better than bondage."" The emphasis is ""his people,"" not T'Challa's, not Wakanda. His people were the ones who suffered from slavery. Could Wakanda have possibly prevented it?Another wonderful surprise of Black Panther is its incredible all-female ensemble that provides expert support to their king. T'Challa has the good fortune of four strong women, each of them having a different and vital relationship to him. The standout will be Danai Gurira (TV's Walking Dead) as the fierce chief of security, Okoye. She has a swagger that vacillates between being intimidating and being brashly enjoyable. Okoye has many of the best lines and she throws herself into every fight. There's also a sense of duty that transcends a single man that challenges her loyalty. Letitia Wright (TV's Humans) plays Shuri, the Q of this world, the top scientist and creator of many a gadget. She's T'Challa's little sister and their interplay is very competitive and teasing. She's looking to be more involved in the action and a highlight is when she teams up with her big bro. Lupita Nyong'o (The Jungle Book) is Nakia, a former flame of T'Challa's who comes in and out of his life as an undercover spy. All three of these women have a powerful sense of agency and are integrated in important and essential ways. Even though Nakia may slide into that romantic interest role, she still has a vibrant life outside whatever feelings she may or may not have for the hero. Then there's T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett), who radiates strength and fortitude. These women gave me some of the biggest moments of entertainment in the entire 135 minutes of movie.Now some careful readers might note that I haven't done much to emphasize the actual action of the super hero action movie, and that's for a good reason. Black Panther stands stronger on theme and character than it does its actual action sequences. Coogler had a wonderful sense of scale and verisimilitude with 2015's Creed, relying on long takes to put the audience in the heightened drama of the boxing ring. With Black Panther, the action sequences can lose a sense of immediacy. Many happen at night or are filmed and edited in ways that diminish some of their impact, like hand-to-hand combat in splashing water where the splashes obscure the activity. Other scenes felt like a video game CGI cut-scene. Speaking of video games, Black Panther's suit has a crazy ability to absorb the kinetic energy of weapons, which means the stakes take a dip when our hero can merely just stand and allow himself to get shot repeatedly. The payoff for this absorption is a giant energy shockwave but it plays out like a fighting game's special feature. It's an aspect that's not really utilized in a satisfying or unique way. The final showdown between Black Panther and Killmonger feels too weightless in execution. It's meant to even the playing field by nullifying their extra abilities, but if they both have the same ""Panther powers"" isn't the field already even? The third act, the usual punching bag for MCU critics, is the best part of the movie from an action standpoint. It utilizes the characters in significant ways and allows for organic complications while still maintaining its wider sense of spectacle. Plus it's one of the few action sequences that allow all the pyrotechnics to be enjoyed during the visibility of day.Boseman (Marshall) was an excellent choice for a stoic and too-cool-for-school character that can glide right on by. The ageless Boseman is at his best when he's working off the other actors, especially his female posse. He has a couple of very effective emotional confrontations as he learns of his family's secrets. As steady and soothing a presence as Boseman can be, this is Jordan's movie. Michael B. Jordan (Creed) has been Coogler's cinematic good luck charm and we're still benefiting from that divine kinship. His character is at the heart of the central thematic question. While T'Challa is ultimately the one who has to decide, it is Killmonger who embodies that need for change and the desire to rectify the past. There's a flashback with Jordan that got me to tear up, and this guy was the villain! It's one of the film's biggest mistakes sidelining Jordan for far too long. After his introduction, Killmonger is strangely absent for the next hour or so of the movie, ceding the spotlight to Serkis (War for the Planet of the Apes), a more antic and goofy scenery-chewing baddie who has a few regrettably ""faux hip"" lines of dialogue that land awkwardly. Serkis is having a blast but can feel like a holdover from a different film.Much like last summer's Wonder Woman, this is a movie that is going to mean a lot to a lot of people. It has a personal significance that I will not be able to fully tap into, no matter the expansive powers of empathy. Black Panther, as a long-awaited cultural moment, will have many ripples of inspiration. After my early screening, I sat back and watched an African-American boy, no older than seven or eight, walk out of the theater in a daze. His eyes were wide, his mouth agape, and he said in astonishment, ""That was the best movie ever."" That kid has a hero he can call his own. That matters. Black Panther, as a work of art, is rich in topical themes and has a wide supporting net of exciting, robust, and capable women. I enjoyed how personal and relevant and political the movie could become, folding new and challenging ideas onto the MCU formula. Coogler is a marvelous director and storyteller showing rare acumen for being able to handle the rigors of a Hollywood blockbuster and deliver something hearty. The action has some issues and there are some structural hiccups that hold it from the MCU's upper echelon (I enjoyed all of the 2017 MCU movies better). Black Panther is a winning movie when it features its sterling cast celebrating their virtues and solidarity and a still respectable enough action spectacle when called upon for big screen duty.Nate's Grade: B"
"413",4,"  Boseman and Jordan are great, but make no mistake Ryan Coogler is the star of this movie. He directors some great action and really digs deep into this character. As someone who has been so inspired by superheroes I can't understate the importance of this movie, everyone deserves to see themself as a superhero. Wakanda forever!"
"414",4,"  I have next to no knowledge of this Marvel character...& I'm white...(gulp), this ought to be interesting...BLACK PANTHERAs I'm not versed in Pantherology, I can't compare anything. So you're getting this evaluation as a film alone, just a heads up. At about 2 & a half hours, this film takes it's time, & tells a solid, cohesive story that both entertains as a stand-alone film, & builds more of the Marvel universe it's a part of. The cast was awesome. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther still steals the show. As a reluctant king, you can really feel just how heavy his crown is, his unsure footing, he's clearly as terrified of screwing up as any of us would be in that situation. He has all the best strengths, and weaknesses, of the whole of humanity, and of course he never gives up, no matter how much easier it would be to do so. He reminds me of just how super the Marvel superheroes are. The villains were amazingly well balanced & layered. Andy Serkis as Claw was a bag full of crazy, clearly Ultron's injury left him brain damaged. Still, he was entertaining. The real main villain was Michael B. Jordan's character, he not only was your classic angry at the world bad guy, he had a good reason to be angry, he even grew sympathetic at the end, I really wish there were more characters with his depth. The rest of the cast was in top form, Panther's family, friends, rivals, & allies, were all able to come together, & really make this world look alive.This is my first trip to Wakanda, & it did not disappoint, it felt like I was looking at a lived in Afro-Atlantian culture, with a good balance of traditional Africa, & 25th century Earth. We got full frontal Africa on display, but it was respectful, the characters joked around a bit, but in a familial sense, the white characters weren't played for laughs or made to look stupid; the bit of PC here was done right.The effects, stunts, fights, & visuals were all done as practically as possible, with CGI used sparingly, & it really helped the film's believability.The music was a mix of tribal & modern, & it complemented the film nicely.This is a 4 star film all the way! Sorry Blade, sorry Steel, I love ya both, but when I think of a superhero for anyone to look up to, no matter the color, I'm now gonna think of Black Panther. This film has the best high points, low points, & everything in between.Wakanda forever!"
"415",3.5,"  Pretty good, a bit long though"
"416",0.5,"  bad decors history stupid its like a bad dreams if you have a dream"
"417",3,"  It's a Marvel movie, so it had to be good. It was good, but not great as Rotten Tomatoes would have you believe. I enjoyed it, but it did have its flaws and I've seen better Marvel movies."
"418",4.5,"  Good movie, great cinematic, but didn't feel like any good characters were really at risk. In end bad people died, good people lived. Needed more sacrifice for a great movie."
"419",0.5,"  Bad cgi and story isn't as good as people hyped it up to be."
"420",5,"  Beyond fantastic! Very deep! Best superhero movie out there."
"421",1.5,"  Its not that i dont like it, its just the fact that no matter what we can never be friendly to one another."
"422",1,"  Oh, for goodness sakes... What the heck are the critics smoking? Gone With The Wind - 92%, Titanic - 88%, Raiders of the Lost Ark - 94%, Saving Private Ryan - 92%, Avatar - 83%. And then we have Black Panther at 97%. Yeah, right...!"
"423",4,"  Its not a ground breaking film, but great characters, an interesting plot, and fun action make it another solid entry in the MCU."
"424",4,"  So.. Black Panther (2018) was a good movie, like James Bond mixed with Lion King. Effects are goofy but not distracting. I liked the villain more than titular character despite laughable dialogue. Martin Freeman as ""fish out of water"" was good. Most of my concerns unwarranted. B+"
"425",5,"  Well worth the wait, I've seen it twice already and it the kind of movie you can enjoy over and over again. Love It!"
"426",4.5,"  With a story that is deeply layered with culture and history, and fully realized characters from T'Challa to the minor characters, Black Panther is the most emotionally investing installment by Marvel Studios, and is certainly a contender for the best"
"427",1,"  one of the most klisheed movies i've seen in the last five decades. so many opportunities for good and universal storytelling wasted. left the theater close to tears because this film so desperately failed. high tech africans drumming and duelling for leadership? - we have such a long way to go before we are truly one."
"428",5,"  Fair or unfair, it's hard to recall a film facing as much cultural responsibility and pressure that ""Black Panther"" did leading up to its release. It's even harder to imagine one bursting through such expectations as resoundingly as Ryan Coogler's latest does, delivering a vivid, thrilling, important achievement that forever changes what blockbusters can mean to people."
"429",3.5,"  This movie is serious, and seriously dark. I hardly see anything in the night scene."
"430",3.5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I think films like this one -- involving black actors as central characters -- are great for America and there should be more to come. But percentage-wise I don't see why it's getting a critic score of 97%. It's a great action flick with an original storyline but the audience score at 79% is more accurate."
"431",3.5,"  Due to the length of the movie it became a little boring at times; Hard for me to stay interested that long. Great acting, great plot, overall great movie."
"432",1,"  This movie is over rated and over hype for no reason."
"433",3.5,"  This film was ridden with plot holes. Some of the cultural nods were intriguing and nice, but overall did not make up for the lack of innovation with the script. Chadwick Boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and makes it not only watchable, but despite the weak script, enjoyable."
"434",5,"  Epic movie with positive African and Black American representations! The women are AWESOME! Enjoy the uncolonized mind. Wakanda Forever!!"
"435",4,"  Gostei bastante...tem umas falhas...mas bem diferente dos filmes mais do mesmo de super herÃ³is que estÃ£o dominando por aÃ­...."
"436",1,"  The race-related hype around this movie is so annoying that I don't even want to see it. The notion that it's an all black movie doesn't sit well with me either"
"437",3.5,"  Critical acclaim and box office success have proved what was once a risky project undertaken by Marvel to take a non-white superhero onto the big screen is well and truly justified. With a briskly paced 134 minutes and timely cultural, racial and gender politics that refreshingly portrays African and female characters properly and positively, this is an entertaining film by co-writer/director Ryan Coogler that works amazingly well in a saturated market where the superhero genre has become formulaic and safe, even though, lest we forget, that this is essentially a black retread of narratives seen before in Thor and Iron Man; with a thankfully more contained and less explode-y finale that does not repeat mistakes of previous Marvel films. Another problem avoided is the bad villain syndrome, as Killmonger is a solidly written and motivated antagonist to our main hero - though he still does the predictable and soapy villain-y thing by not killing the hero outright when he can which ultimately precipitates his own demise. Slowed down combat scenes provide a cleaner and clearer look and the gadgets are inventive, but for a big budgeted Marvel film, I find it hard to overlook the two major fight scenes that take place over a watery arena that look jarringly obvious that they are shot in a green-screened studio and stand out like a sore thumb, especially compared to the excellently staged 'Busan Drift' car chase scene mid-film that has more location shots and looks much better and more convincing for it. Together with an excellent cast and an unconvoluted and smart standalone script that introduces characters and plotlines clearly and succinctly, the film's pros do outweigh its cons, and shows what more innovative ideas and risk-taking can do for the evolution and progress of this increasingly tired genre."
"438",5,"  Amazing and refreshing ! A true superhero film in every sense."
"439",1,"  Well, I just wrote a long review for this and then posted it, or tried to, before logging in. I then logged in, hit ""post"" without noticing that my carefully written review was gone, and now have to write it all over again. So here we go, take two:Black Panther did not catch or hold my attention from the very first scene. Even the music over the black screen as it faded in had me thinking ""Uh-oh. Well, it will probably get much better, so we'll give it the benefit of the doubt"". It never did. Instead, like a late night re-run of ""The A-Team"", I felt like I could have slept through most of it without missing anything. To be blunt, I thought it was boring.Other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, particularly within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I disagree, but it isn't the only time I found myself on the opposite side of the fence with a Marvel movie.The first time it happened was with Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which I loved. It has things I don't like, but overall, I still enjoy that movie a great deal. The blend of music, cinematography, effects, and story, made me feel like I was watching the best of grand opera. But, it didn't perform well and the character was rebooted with Edward Norton playing Bruce Banner. I liked pretty much every scene that had Norton in it, but started disliking the movie when the Abomination was revealed as the villain. Not that I have anything against that villain, but I didn't like the way he was handled in that movie.More recently, I disliked all the political maneuvering in Civil War. Take that out, and I might have liked it. As it is, after seeing it more times than I care to admit, I still don't like it. Ragnarok was too jokey for my taste. Not that I don't like the humor in Marvel movies--usually I love it, but in Ragnarok, it made Thor the butt of every joke, and I didn't like that.The problem with Black Panther, at least, the problem I have with it, is that everyone connected to the film seems to have taken themselves so seriously that they stifled all the life from the film. It was like watching a DC movie, where the superheroes may as well be empty costumes for all the personality they have.Unlike others, I did not like Boseman as T'Challa, nor did I like him in ""Civil War"". It was one of the things that irritated me about the movie. Marvel has made some brilliant casting decisions, from Idris Elba as Heimdall, Chriss Pratt as Starlord, and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. How could they blow their streak of casting every Marvel superhero to date perfectly by giving us an actor who was so regal that the character lacked a personality and any discernible flaws?Add to this the claustrophobic sets, average cinematography, tedious story and editing, and the nonsensical mixture of tribal and futuristic culture, and this movie really falls apart.It was watchable in the sense that it didn't offend me (unlike ""the Manchurian Candidate remake, which I walked out on), but it could have been much more interesting if the filmmakers hadn't treated every aspect of this story like a Faberge egg they were afraid might break if they breathed too hard. The political content was sublimated more than expected, but it didn't bother me. I just wish they had let themselves cut loose and make something that was less safe."
"440",2.5,"  It wasn't good. Just wasn't. The memes. Oh the memes. The main character was boring. The villain was not good. The whole reason why the villain was a villain was so stupid. Andy Serkis was one of the only good characters and they kill him in the first 30 minutes. Vibranium is stupid now. After this film, every avenger should have a black panther suit. Theres no excuse now. How does wakanda work? Now really? Why are some of the people ok with living in huts and stuff, while the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city? But, even the hyper super duper citi, isn't that much hyper super. Why do they have a big main street with a market that looks like it was taken from a third world country? Why do they decide how is going to be king with a fight to the death? The cgi in the last fight scene between purple black panther and golden black panther is really bad.Really not a good movie and it creates a big number of problems for all the other films in this universe. Some of it was enjoyable, but then they had to talk about memes, or call someone a whiteboy, or a colonizer. Oh and if you need to do something, like stop a car, or save someone who was shot in the spine, or just have a holo-chat with your friend, you can use these super futuristic hyper technical vibranium balls that everyone wears as a bracelet. Yeah, just stick it in his spine and he is all fixed up. Who-hu. ugh.And I'm not even gonna talk about how the villain's plan to take over wakanda is just plain stupid for no good reason. Other than, oh hey, let's have him kill this dude, and then be totally badass in a fight with the hero.Ok, that's enough. It's not good. Don't go see it."
"441",2.5,"  Not the best marvel movie ever. Got rave reviews for having a mainly black cast and I get that it's awesome but what do you expect from a film set in a fictional African country? The film was good but not great. It was a big repetitve loop with no sirprises. The final fight scene reminded me of the one in Star wars the phantom menace..."
"442",3,"  If you put the political baggage aside, I think Black Panther is good. The pacing, lack of development, predictability and poor CGI prevent it from being perfect, but overall it is enjoyable and worth watching if you're a Marvel fan. To quote RedLetterMedia: ""it was alright."""
"443",3.5,"  Well it looks like Rotten tomatoes has finally let me type my review on this movie I seen the movie the day it came out. I enjoyed Black Panther I thought the storyline line was good the film looked amazing you can tell everyone involved with this movie worked hard to make this a success. Marvel knows when to gamble and when not to and it almost always pays off. Now what dose have me just a little concerned is it seems like they put so much into this movie can they come back with a second movie and it be just as good. Black Panther has alot of different storylines to make a second movie like teaming up with the Fantastic Four or marrying Storm from Xmen or they could show make a movie about Mephisto tricking Nakia into turning her back on Black Panther so their is a few places they can go if their willing to do so cause it won't be cheap. So If you have enjoyed the Marvel movies so far Black Panther won't let you down."
"444",4,"  I enjoyed the movie and it is certainly one of the better Marvel films but it is not the greatest Marvel movie that the critics would have you believe. The origin story is good but goes on a bit too long. There also not enough of the Black Panther doing his thing. Virtually no reference to any of the Avengers so it feels more like a standalone movie. Winter Soldier Doctor Strange and Ragnorok rank higher imo."
"445",5,"  Amazing movie! Definitely a must see."
"446",1.5,"  Black panther can be an interesting superhero, but in this movie he is a male Mary Sue charecter with an equally boring plot. The Action scenes were boring, and the protagonists felt like villains with the actual villain being the only interesting character in the movie. Other than that there were a few other things in the movie I disliked, like the race-baiting jokes like ""And who are you, the colonizer"" and the special effects being cartoony or unrealistic. Overall, this movie was a disappointment considering I wanted to see it, and ending up watching a boring and rushed movie"
"447",5,"  My favourite Marvel film so far, excellent story, all characters were fleshed out properly in my opinion, with what I would deem to be the second best MCU villain"
"448",1.5,"  Mediocre story with awful acting packaged in an atrocious screenplay attached with so called hard hitting political dialogues - I am out of bad lingo in my dictionary describing this worst Marvel movie ever made. The only grace being Letitia and Lupita's warm portrayal of plastic characters. Ohh I forgot to mention that I have heard snoring for the first time in a movie screening."
"449",5,"  Beautiful movie with a lot your can get from it as far as lessons on family, culture and more. A slight knock because of the CG, but the story line makes up for it greatly. This movie has very relate-able characters and will movie you. Many people will see themselves on the screen"
"450",5,"  It was amazing i loved how we got to see such amazing technology but one thing i didn't really like was how there was just so much instant death"
"451",5,"  Black Panther ! divine, sweet smelling, fragrant, aromatic"
"452",2.5,"  why do the critics automatically 'grade with a curve' on black/lgbt movies.....this was an ok movie at best...certainly not a 97%...to give it that only cheapens the credibility of all reviews by them......nor did I find the special effects 'high schoolish' as Medved claims....it would have been a much more enjoyable movie if they had left out the race baiting bs.......they racial animosity by the characters was over the top"
"453",5,"  At first I had no desire to see this movie and that it was only being hyped because it was Marvel and had a predominately black cast. I finally decided to check out the movie to see what the hype was about and I loved it! The action,actors, soundtrack and fx were awesome. Probably going to buy the dvd. Glad I checked it out. So far my favorite movie of 2018!"
"454",2.5,"  Much like the Last Jedi, the reviews on this movie are 100% wrong. The movie itself was ok, special effects were below average as was the story. As marvel movies go, it doesn't crack the top 10. As the characters go, Killmonger was pretty lame, the only characters that really stood out were Klaue, the princess and M'Baku. I don't want to give away the plot but if you're on the ropes about seeing this movie, wait for video, it definitely doesn't live up to the hype."
"455",4.5,"  1978-Superman.....1989-Batman......2004-Spider-Man 2.......2008-The Dark Night......2017-Logan......2018......BLACK PANTHER. Black Panther is honest to god, one of the best superhero movies ever made. Everything about this movie just worked. This movie has been getting a lot of hype, as well as a lot of hate, and going in, I was hesitant. Getting to excited about movies like this can lead to disappointment, which can really suck. This movie is not disappointing, this movie is exceptional. Ryan Coogler brings his all to this film, and it shows. Just like Creed, his love for long take fights shows through an incredible casino tracking shot. The best thing about this movie is the characters. We all have been hearing about how amazing Michael B. Jorden is in the movie, and I can say that they are right, damn right. He is by far the best MCU villain. I don't really want to give anymore away, so all I'll say is that this is a near perfect movie, and I god damn loved it"
"456",0.5,"  Meh, at best. The CGI was obvious and reminded me of Tobey McGuire's Spider-Man. The plot is the basic boring format that all of these movie have become. And the comedy was just a cringe-fest. Not to mention that T'Challa is boring and uninteresting. Killmonger could have been interesting, but instead he became the generic revenge villain. All in all, a failure for Marvel, I'd say."
"457",3,"  Black Panther stumbles a little bit out of the gate, but picks itself up around the halfway mark and finishes strong. Once the villain's motivation becomes clear, the Black Panther becomes the most thought provoking MCU movie yet, despite being a little sloppy in execution."
"458",0.5,"  What is everybody talking about. This movie was horrible! Corny, predictable, very slow moving for the first hour....and the hidden agenda in the movie was not hidden much....if at all. I think this movie is getting the high rating it has based more on political factors than the quality of the movie."
"459",5,"  An entertaining introduction to the universal Afro-diaspora, but not for those fragile Europeans or Americans who are only used to seeing Africans in a position of poorness and underdeveloped."
"460",5,"  Loved this movie, man!!!"
"461",2.5,"  I went in with way too high expectations."
"462",2,"  A good, but not great movie. Mixing a political agenda in all forms of entertainment is getting tiresome as well. I go to the movies to escape that."
"463",0.5,"  Don't waste your time. This film is garbage."
"464",4.5,"  It may not take any risks in the technical aspects, except for costume design, but Ryan Coogler's effort succeeds within the MCU thanks to its effective ""Godfather-meets-James-Bond"" kind of story, great action scenes, dazzling tribal imagery and magnificent performances by its mostly black cast, especially those by Chadwick Boseman, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis and Michael B. Jordan. Moreover, this film is an outstanding honor to African American society while still maintaining a sense of universality and delivers a critique on America's superiority complex while also asking for true brotherhood with the other nations. For all these reasons, ""Black Panther"" matters."
"465",5,"  Excellent and refreshing"
"466",5,"  A Must See, and further proof, Marvel Studios owns this game"
"467",5,"  Being tested as a new king, great villain, memorable characters and dialogues. This movie has great details and story is done just right."
"468",5,"  With the 18th movie in the Marvel cinematic universe, Black Panther has proved to be the best of them all.With the combination of good actors, visuals, story and soundtrack and Ryan Coogler's direction, Blank Panther provides not only a great entertaining movie, but has over looked the cliche' superhero movie plots."
"469",5,"  I loved the movie. It was so amazing. And the clothes were amazing.??????????????????????"
"470",5,"  The plot was amazing, The villain is the best of the MCU, The cast is great and the jokes are funny as hell!"
"471",1,"  Glorified black man. Great. good job. please get over your selves, and start contributing to society."
"472",2,"  decent special effects. Very long , boring development with some ok content but overall not for me. I would wait for redbox if you are considering it. If I didn't have to get out of the house for the wife's book club I would have waited for Redbox ."
"473",0.5,"  shitty racist movie................................"
"474",4,"  Black Panther is a new, bold direction for action/superhero films; it is like a unique immersion into the African/fictional Wakandan culture which is best displayed in its ""afrofuturistic"" potential. This film takes interesting steps by exploring political and socially relevant issues regarding race, culture, and a sense of identity; people of color are also represented in a more positive light. Despite some problems with poor pacing, lack of great action, and bloated CGI, Black Panther fulfills expectations by delivering wonderful production design, colorful costumes, Shakesperean-esque drama, solid characters, and a substantial narrative."
"475",0.5,"  This movie is overrated af. Not even top 5 marvel mcu. So boring. CGI is terrible and doesnt look natural. Save your money movie is overhyped"
"476",3.5,"  Most likely an unpopular opinion: great superhero film, but not much else. Slow start to the film and sped up too fast near the end. Killmonger enters Wakanda and has himself a duel and the throne within 10 minutes? Then he loses the battle and dies without much drama even though his whole life had revolved around finding and taking over Wakanda. Regardless of the flaws, it was a delight to see almost an all-black cast with strong and witty performances all around. The cinematography was on point as was the music. Would definitely recommend, but does not live up to the hype coming out of the US"
"477",2.5,"  Disappointing! Black Panther has been a favorite character since I started collecting comics 40 years ago and really hoped for success on the big screen. Major plot holes, downright bad CGI in several scenes, and unnecessary political themes. This movie was better than anything DC/WB has produced but as far as Marvel goes did not meet expectations. Blade 1 & 2 were better."
"478",4,"  A good, worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic universe. It is slightly overrated and contains a major plot hole that just feels like lazy writing. But nonetheless, a decent movie"
"479",3,"  It's like when chinese ppl make a movie and everyone in the movie can't say English and can't drive cars. And the only meal scene they have they will be eating dog meat sitting around a hot pot.------------------------------------------------------------------I was a part of the protest when H^m made the ""coolest monkey in the jungle"" shirt..........and in this movie, there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys. You gotta be fucking kidding me."
"480",3.5,"  Movie is good, but definetly not the best marvel movie.Fresh rating it gets!"
"481",3,"  It was good I liked it."
"482",5,"  Can't wait to watch it. Couldn't get my favorite seat for the last two weeks."
"483",1.5,"  His sister was the best part of the movie. It was ok, but not nearly as good as several other marvel movies."
"484",3,"  It was alright. Not great, but not terrible. Spent too much time on the pointless or political and not enough time spent being a superhero. While it might have a cultural signifigance, I found my eyes rolling more than once over some obvious and out-of-place digs and the bad guys were the best part of the film by far. Scar was energetic and just entertaining to watch, and his screentime was fun and actually entertaining. Killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get too much and was kind of an arse, he was still a fairly believable bad guy and person. Overall I wouldn't rush to theaters to see it, but if your local movie place has it as a cheap rental I'd consider picking it up. Here's hoping Black Panther gets to really show off his claws in another, better, movie."
"485",5,"  outstanding, movie of the year!"
"486",4,"  All together, Black Panther is a strong film and one of the best MCU movies to date. The strongest elements of the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of Wakanda. Chadwick Boseman is incredible as the lead and easily one of the most relatable and best heroes of the MCU. The story focuses more on his struggles trying to lead a kingdom rather than being a perfect superhero, relying too much in his powers. This makes him very relatable to the audience. The same goes for Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, who is arguably the greatest MCU villain to date. Killmonger is one of the best aspects of the film; however, his screen time is limited compared to what it could have been. The rest of the cast also put in top performances, specifically Andy Serkis, Florence Kasumba, and Letitia Wright. Although the movie is solid overall, it still has its flaws despite the massive hype and expectations. The action sequences are often weak and the CGI is poor at times. This is specifically noticeable in the final fight. The fight between Killmonger and Black Panther is fought in a dark setting, so it can be difficult to see the action. Also, the large scale fight is underwhelming with Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi constantly switching sides not making much sense and feeling necessary only for the fight to happen. The second half of the movie can feel a little rushed too. Despite these drawbacks, the overall story and connectable and strong characters make up for the flaws. Black Panther is an enjoyable movie and a solid entry into the world of Wakanda and Black Panther."
"487",5,"  Most cinematic marvel movie Ive seen in years."
"488",5,"  Movie was great.. I was scared it wouldn't be after all the hype but it's one of the few movies that stood up to it's own hype... Very well done... Great story, great acting and great fight scenes....Just a tad too much CGI however..."
"489",5,"  This was an amazing movie. Great story telling, Great action And great symbolism. I highly recommend."
"490",1,"  Please, we don't have to like it just because it's popular to. Not as good as MANY lesser rated Marvel movies!"
"491",5,"  Saw it twice already"
"492",2.5,"  Doesn't actually live up to the hype. It's an okay film at best."
"493",5,"  Marvel you done it again and this is the best one yet. Black panther is one of the best superhero film I ever watch this year. I like how the film explore the African culture in a cool and awesome way I like that in a film plus the characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals in the film are beautiful and cool and Wakanda what a place I like it and marvel got it right. Overall black panther was a fun, awesome action-packed superhero film I ever watch this year with a well crafted story, lovable characters, and beautiful visuals that makes this film awesome in every way. Well done marvel and director Ryan Coogler you guys made a very well crafted and fun superhero film ever and black panther is my favorite superhero because he knows how to rule a country and he is a king for god sake's and I like that. Good job and well done best superhero film of 2018 can wait for infinity war and that one is going to be the best one and they save the best one for last. Black panther welcome to the family. ALL HAIL KING T'CHALLA. ""WAKANDA FOREVER""."
"494",5,"  Absolutely engrossing and electrifying, there is no way to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself. Truly impossible, this movie is 10/10"
"495",1,"  In my head, I came to see an interesting movie with a good story that makes sense. The movie doesn't have to be completely realistic, but there is a fine line between what is okay when it comes to being unrealistic and being downright insane. It was boring, the visuals were dull, and there weren't any good sound effects. If you want to waste your time, here's the movie for you!"
"496",3,"  After watching Annihilation, this movie rocked! Excellent acting by all actors. Loved seeing a few LOTOR alumni, walking dead Michonne actress kicking ass, and the story was well played out and action packed of course. By no means a Guardians of the Galaxy or Iron Man caliber but still very entertaining."
"497",4,"  Very fun and splendidly acted action flick. Highly recommend."
"498",4.5,"  Black Panther is easily one of the most talked about movies in recent memory. A lot of it stems from the fact that it's (debatably) the first mainstream blockbuster to have a predominantly Black cast, and also the first that deals with issues affecting Black people around the world. For a lot of people, this was more than just a movie. It was a cultural moment. That's completely understandable, given Hollywood's history of racism and underrepresentation. Black Panther broke all sorts of records, and reeled in over $200,000,000 opening weekend, in the U.S. alone. It's really making its mark, and for good reason.It also helps that it's one of Marvel's best. After T'Challa (Black Panther) stole the show in Civil War, people were excited to see him in a story of his own. In this movie, he has become the king of Wakanda, an African nation that mines Vibranium (the stuff Captain America's shield is made of) to create extraordinary technology but disguises itself as an impoverished, third world country. T'Challa is conflicted about whether he should continue allowing Wakanda to thrive as an isolationist country or if he should use its wealth and technology to benefit the rest of the world. He begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be when the throne is challenged by Killmonger, a soldier who seeks to start worldwide uprising and bring it all under Wakanda. Killmonger was easily one of the best villains in the MCU, if not the best overall. He has a charismatic and patient side, but also a violent and aggressive side. Without giving too much away, his last on-screen appearance was a very good scene. The other characters were also pretty good. Shuri was fun to watch with all her technology. Okoye had some great fight scenes. Ross was a good comic relief. M'Baku was a good character. Andy Serkis is one of the best actors to play a villain. The list goes on. One of the best things about the movie is the way it builds the world. You don't need to be familiar with the comics to understand Wakanda, and its people, culture, and traditions are shown in great detail, making it fascinating to watch. Wakanda is beautiful, the people, the landscape, and the futuristic cityscape. It also helps that the movie's soundtrack, which ranges from traditional African music to orchestral movie music to rap and hip-hop, is absolutely fantastic. The blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film, with the combat shown ranging from swordfights to aerial battles that look like they're right out of Star Wars. The rituals shown involving T'Challa's coronation were great. He participates in ritual combat, and talks to his deceased father in the Ancestral Plane, which reminds me of The Lion King. That's actually a downside to the film, without giving too much away, it's strikingly similar to The Lion King in several different ways, not just because it's set in Africa. Black Panther still does it very well, though. The people show the different cultures of Wakanda, which are based on real African cultures. There are articles online that document the real life inspiration behind some of Black Panther's imagery, which are really great reads.In conclusion, Black Panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of memorable characters, an amazing world and culture within its setting, and a great albeit familiar story. This movie meant a lot for many people, and it was an absolute pleasure to see on the big screen. This one is very highly recommended."
"499",5,"  Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!"
"500",4.5,"  Was a good movie, but don't go seeing it believing the ""best ever hype"" because of the best Marvel DC movies, each one has aspects that are better and worse than the others. I'd say it's on par with Home Coming / Civil War / Wonder Woman / Ragnarok , but by no means are any of them ""the best"". It was a good movie, with good characters, a good story, and a wonderful take on the MCU world we've not seen yet. The villain was probably the most stand out part."
"501",5,"  Enjoyed the elements Marvel added. The villain was great."
"502",0.5,"  I attempted to leave a review of this on the 23rd. For the next four days, I could see no reviews. Now reviews are showing. This movie is about as anti-American and insulting to black Americans as any I've seen. It suggests that blacks in the US are so pathetic as to be unable to do anything for themselves, and that America is so lacking that spaceship flying Africans have to bring aid to help them. It is anti-capitalist. It presents a society in the middle of Africa that looks like any US city with US type tastes and activities and language. The only thing African about it is the superficial dress and kitsch hanging on stalls. It's insulting to Africans. It suggests that blacks all over the world are somehow linked to one another when the opening sequence contains blacks enslaving blacks, killing blacks, and separated into multiple factions. It's a mass of contradictions, trite superficial observations, and leftist drivel. I strongly advise against seeing it."
"503",3.5,"  Overall a pretty good effort, but Guardians is still tops!"
"504",5,"  I will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to the movies still. In my opinion the gender roles are very balance. I didn't see anything involving racism like some people trying to make it look. You always have those who find bad things about any movie and even cartoons.  I think is a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are. When I went to see this movie the audience was very diverse and people applaud at the end of the movie. You don't see this kind of people's reaction for a movie that much nowadays. When they show women warriors in this movie, they were not kidding. They have some nice martial arts skills. Coming from a person who has done martial arts and involve with different styles since the 80's."
"505",4,"  Marvel superhero film with most diverse and greatest depth of characters across good and evil. A lot of layers making one care about heroes and villains and the grey areas in between. Strong male and female characters and each with their own story arc and struggle to overcome."
"506",5,"  Awesome movie. Saw it twice. Headed back for a third viewing."
"507",3,"  Watched it this past weekend with my wife and two children.I thought it was okay, but I don't see how this movie is seen as groundbreaking. Like almost all Marvel movies, the villain died relatively easily, nobody got hurt and things went according to plan. There was the obligatory fighting-falling scene right out The Matrix. No Way was this better than Ironman, Ironman 3, Winter Soldier, Ant Man, Civil War. This was right with Spider-Man Homecoming. It was okay, but you don't leave the theatre with strong emotions."
"508",3.5,"  It was pretty good but not as good as I expected it to be."
"509",5,"  Great movie it delivers on every level."
"510",1,"  The last two superhero movies I enjoyed were Deadpool and (if you relax the definition a bit) The Last Jedi. The genre just does nothing for me. I had high-hopes for this film--given the stellar reviews it's been getting. My reaction to this film was almost identical to another highly-regarded superhero movie: Wonderwoman. But, as with that film, 30 minutes in, and I was done. The costumes and production design were quite creative, but I had zero emotional investment in any of the characters. How can you possibly sit thru a story where you don't FEEL anything (except bored and antsy)? At the half-hour mark I went into the lobby to ask about refund/re-admission policy and they (to their credit) cheerfully refunded my money. If superhero movies aren't your thing, I'd strongly advise you skip this one, too."
"511",5,"  This movie was pure perfection! The cinematography, the story, the acting, the music, EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!!! I am waiting for the moment I can go back and watch it again!!!"
"512",5,"  Black Panther is great with a great hero played by Chadwick Boseman and giving us MCU version of Klaw but the best part of the movie is Michael B. Jordan kill-monger was very different from most MCU villains with better motives than other MCU bad guys to Kill-Monger was the best part of this movie. Black Panther is one of the best Marvel movies its a great movie 10/10"
"513",5,"  Black Panther is Marvel's answer to DC's The Dark Knight. Pairing a complex hero with an equally relatable antagonist that create a very dynamic protagonist-antagonist relationship."
"514",2,"  A star-studded special-effects extravaganza, ruined by numerous plot holes and by making Wakanda into Donald Trump's wet dream (only with black people). Relies mostly on moving so fast that you have no time to realize how nonsensical or racist it is (really? black people HOOTING like apes, and doing it PROUDLY because they're doing it at a white guy?). Two stars, strictly for SFX, acting quality and direction, in that order."
"515",2,"  It was alright. I don't get all of the hype."
"516",4.5,"  Black Panther elevates superhero movies to a new level beyond expectations telling one of the MCU'S best and most absorbing stories. The performances from the whole cast are great playing some of the MCU's most realized and well thought out characters. Overall, the stories and characters are something even non-superhero fans can enjoy."
"517",4,"  Really liked this movie. It is a positive good in the world. Glad it was made."
"518",3.5,"  Missing the usual Marvel Action, the movie is more of telling a personal story than being part of Marcel Universe. Spiderman on the other side was much better..."
"519",3.5,"  It may not be as gripping as The Winter Soldier nor is it as terrible as Thor 2, but Black Panther impresses with a great villain, powerful story and strong performances."
"520",5,"  wow! see it. 'nuff said'"
"521",1,"  Falls far short of a good movie. Tomato Meter is broken on this one."
"522",3.5,"  Was a good film, Not the best marvel film Captain America,-Winter Soldier, Guardians and Iron Man are much better. Definitly worth seeing though."
"523",5,"  Easy in the top 3 of Marvel movies, and just a great movie. The only let down here are some poor special effects in the final fight!"
"524",0.5,"  Wow worst movie I have ever seen. Will be forgotten and filed under ""overrated super hero crap""."
"525",3.5,"  Its decent Marvel fare though nothing spectacular. Standard formula set in Africa instead of Asgaard say. Michael B Jordan's character put a bit of a spin on the villain though I wish there was more of Andy Serkis's Klaue. Supporting cast forgettable though. Very noticeably PG-13 film with some of the deaths and lack of blood with one death in particular. Premise of Wakanda is absurd of course but it being a comic book film I'll give it a quick eye roll and accept it."
"526",5,"  Great movie! Loved the story line and the characters. Definitely a recommendation to anyone who hasn't seen it yet."
"527",4.5,"  Marvel's most satisfying and authentic origin story. Full review soon. Rating: 87"
"528",1,"  First time through, it was great, but they dont deliver a believable advanced society. Most of the technology is more superfluous junk like we already have, and its nothing Stark couldnt manage."
"529",5,"  Black Panther is honestly one of the greatest superhero movies of all times, and the greatest solo superhero movie since Wonder Woman. The cast, specifically Chadwick Boseman, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan, provides such strong performances."
"530",5,"  The story was pretty generic; prince becomes king, loses crown, has to fight to win it back. It is the subtext that really shines; what is man's duty to help others, and what is the cost? And the women are empowered in this movie; nice to see!"
"531",2,"  rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the hype and the disappointment was insurmountable to the hype it lived up to."
"532",5,"  Just an ALL AROUND AMAZING MOVIE! Killmonger had you wondering if you should be believing in his measage or black panther's!!! Well casted and amazing writing."
"533",1,"  This movie was very over-hyped and under-delivered. The two main villains were more interesting than the movies heroes. I enjoyed the movies scenery but was very disappointed with the fight scenes compared with past Marvel movies."
"534",4,"  Visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best origin films since the original Iron Man. Michael B Jordan stuns as the villain, though he could have done more if he wanted to go down as one of the all time great villains."
"535",5,"  The best movie in The MCU so far."
"536",5,"  SO AMAZING BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN"
"537",2.5,"  So so, dragged on in the middle. The music felt out of place from time to time. Half of the jokes didn't hit. I needed more colonizer x sister romance."
"538",5,"  Black Panther - it's been a long time coming, but was worth the wait. Insightful, funny, and all the glamour of a super hero movie."
"539",3.5,"  A good Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Not the best, definitely not the worst. Casting and acting were great - the actors did a spectacular job of bringing their characters to life and everyone seemed to get a good amount of screen time. Chadwick Boseman really brought T'Challa to life, as did Michael Jordan with Killmonger who I felt could have used a little more screen-time. Letitia Wright gets a special shout-out here for bringing just enough humor and lightheartedness to the movie to keep it lively.Action scenes were great - no surprise there but the best action scene is probably the car-chase that happens mid-movie. The big scene at the end suffers a bit from too many simultaneous things happening at once and thus, too many cuts and jumps from one battle to another. The effects were spot on and some of Marvels best, especially the aerial craft and Wakanda scenes. Exception to this was the creatures, like the battle-rhinos, which screamed CGI in that bad way. The pacing was good - I never had the feeling I was getting bored or the movie was stalling, and I didn't have the feeling it was moving too fast to me to keep up with it. Cinematography is average to good with no fancy camera angles or tricks to write home about. Sound and music the same. No scenes stand out that I'll remember a year from now based on any of these alone unlike Andy Dufrane's escape from Shawshank Prison or the quiet hum of Darth Vader's lightsaber as he's standing in the corridor waiting for Obi-wan Kenobi.The writing - mediocre. I think they could have told a better story for Black Panther rather than creating a Marvel version of ""The Lion King"" - Young king who is inexperienced and unsure of himself who has to suddenly take over the kingdom. Spiritual advice from his deceased father during vision quest. Primary antagonist is his unc..actually, cousin in this one, who is wildly unpopular among the people of this utopia; which still handles matters of succession not by democracy or any kind of elect system, but through ritual bloodsport of the strongest. It's usually in the writing that Marvel Cinematic Universe movies do good or bad in with few exceptions. Overall, Black Panther was good, not great. It's not ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1"" great or ""Ironman"" great or ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" great and it has it's flaws but most of Marvel's CU lineup does. Why the paid critics choose to give it such high marks is beyond me, and I expect some of it is due to internal politics and not their love of movies. When you rank the Marvel lineup by audience score, you see a different picture which puts Black Panther in the middle of the pack where I feel is more appropriate for what I saw on the screen. I haven't seen a ""bad"" Marvel Cinematic Universe movie yet and when Black Panther's sequel comes out, I'll be picking up my ticket again opening night."
"540",0.5,"  SJW PC Wortless thrash"
"541",3,"  Nothing special, I'd say it's on par with the first Captain America/ Thor."
"542",5,"  One of the best movies of 2018."
"543",5,"  An excellent and exciting film with a villain that you can believe"
"544",4,"  Black Panther is above all, a solid film that ranks among the top tier of Marvel films. What holds it back from being truly transcendent of its genre is the tonal dichotomy that never quite works. Black Panther can't quick decide if it wants to be an intimate, cultural opus or a flashy, revolutionary tale and suffers ever so slightly for trying to be both. An important film none-the-less, Black Panther is undoubtedly a success."
"545",5,"  Breathtaking, Revolutionary, Stunning"
"546",2.5,"  I found many aspects of Black Panther to be copied from other Marvel films such as the Thor Trilogy such as dream sequence where both Thor & T'Challa interact with late fathers etc. Also Similar to Thors brother Loki assuming command of Asgard after Thors fall from grace similar to T'Challa's cousin assuming command of Wakanda after his fall from grace!Then we have T'Challa reluctantly on both parts teaming up with an outcast tribe similar to Thor teaming up with Loki & rebels to save Asgardians.Then we have T'Challa having secret relation due to his uncle having a kid who returns home after the old ruler of Wakanda dies to claim the throne just like in Thor 3 when Odin dies, Hela comes along & does the exact same thing!I even saw similarities between Thors Asgard protector Heimdal & Black Panthers Wakanda protector Okoye... both loyal to royal blood line!Had I not have seen & loved Thor films then I would have been blown away by Black Panther!"
"547",5,"  Easily Marvel's best film. Black Panther represents what can happen when you use the comic book genre for more than just a battle with a generic villain bent on destroying or ruling the world. The actors are fantastic and with a film full of characters none feel two-dimensional. The director adeptly juggles the characters so that each one feels defined in spite of the limits of time. This film is groundbreaking on so many levels and marks a milestone for Marvel. The love those who created this film had for the material shines through in every minute of the film.Wakanda forever!"
"548",2.5,"  After all the hype everywhere, and a 100% rating on RT, I was expecting something truly epic, with a side dish of liberal BS as seems to be the case everywhere these days. What I got instead was a typical, completely predictable Marvel Trope. Honestly, not as much liberal BS as I was expecting. The movie kinda delves into the origins of Black Panthers, why they wanted their fictional country of Wakanda ot stay hidden, and fair enough, the motivations of both sides are understandable, and you can empathize with both sides. Where the movie fails completely is execution. There is only maybe 10-15 minutes of decent action, and maybe another 15 mins of completely ridiculous ""Godzilla"" style fights where the viewer is not emotionally invested at all. *spoiler alert* Both antagonists and protagonists wear a pretty much indestructible suit, and proceed to punch the crap out of each other, but in the end, everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy. Pluses: The sister of the king is fairly enjoyable to watch, she has some decent one liners, some jokes:""What are THOOOSE?!"" fall a bit flat, but maybe that's just because of the current meme culture, where something is extremely funny for a week, and then immediately dated and old. The inevitable political BS: Honestly, not as much as I expected. Sure, 95% of characters are black. Well, sure, it's a movie set in Africa, what did you expect? But as far as pushing any kind of propaganda, I didn't see almost any of it. They just wanted to make a movie about Black Panther, they just didn't make it all that interesting. The last 30-40 mins of the movie I was seriously considering leaving the theater, because you knew exactly what was going to happen. Overall, I'd say 2.5/5"
"549",5,"  Pure fun. This movie raises the bar for super hero films. Great story, believable character development, and fantastic villains. The casino scene reminded me a little bit of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's only good part, the epic fight in the Chinese night club."
"550",5,"  AMAZING. IM SHOOK. MY WIG FEW SO FAR IT IS NOW ORBITING MARS"
"551",0.5,"  Boring premise, lazy acting. Obvious plot twists. More politically charged than dear white people. Thanks for ruining the comic disney."
"552",5,"  Phenomenal, better than I expected."
"553",2,"  Generic Marvel movie. If you like predictable happy ending plots with tons of big budget special effects, this movie is for you. Most of the movie I was just wondering if it was almost over. I thought the entire movie was very forgettable other than the talented Letitia Wright, whose role as the female sister heroine 'Q' type gadget guru saved the film. Michael B. Jordan's acting was cringeworthy-- the most over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a Marvel film."
"554",2.5,"  solid movie, but slower than i was expecting. Needed more action compared to other marvel movies"
"555",5,"  Epic.. Empowering.. Never forget tale of African history!"
"556",5,"  Seen it twice and I'll be back!"
"557",5,"  I started suffering superhero fatigue and skipped the last couple of Marvel releases. Black Panther brought me back. I guess it's true what they say about going black..."
"558",1,"  Top shelf fecal matter. 2 hours and 15 min of my life I won't get back"
"559",2.5,"  A fairly vanilla superhero movie. The villain is interesting for a while, but it turns out he's just a one-dimensional radical, while the hero is a one-dimensional good-because-he-is-good guy. The story is nothing special and the action is not even that exciting. All in all, a pretty average movie that I would not go out of my way to watch again"
"560",3.5,"  Good entertaining movie but its just your usual Marvel movie, people making out that this was the greatest movie ever is way too much, its good but not that good. Fairly predictable story line but its well acted and looks good so would recommend people see it"
"561",5,"  Great movie! Best Marvel film since Guardians!"
"562",4,"  Made my friends cry. Speechless. Wakanda Forever"
"563",0.5,"  Not a terrible movie just doesn't fit in with the marvel universe. The movies seems more or less an over the top story similar to a dc franchise version of a superhero adaption."
"564",1.5,"  this was a really bad movie. I was so disappointed in this movie that I wanted a refund after I saw the movie."
"565",3,"  You can say what you will of the several decades long Marvel cinematic franchise, but one thing you can't say it is not is ""average"". Marvel and subsequent owners Disney have constructed a Michelin 3-star bivouac of action movie tent poles in which to house the American collective unconscious. These are movies that are guaranteed to give you a chuckle, a thrill, maybe a chill, but you certainly won't be leaving the theater any more or less enlightened than when you walked in. This makes the franchise the pinnacle of what ""esteemed"" American director Paul S. W. Anderson calls ""populist film making"". In that aspect, Black Panther undoubtedly joins the ranks of the franchise's finest, like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Howard the Duck.""It's popular ergo it's good"" is a statement one would attribute to flawed logic. Just look at the Fast and Furious, Resident Evil, and Transformers franchises. Please don't misunderstand me here; this movie doesn't even come close to stooping to that level of crapola mediocrity. It is killing at the box office not only because it hardly has anything to compete with, but, on a technical level, it checks all of the boxes. Lucky for Marvel Disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype and accolades, but as I hope to make a bit clearer, there is something very tainted surrounding Black Panther, a conflict lying hidden within the deeper layers of the film. You could see it as a profound commentary on American society, an ingenious marketing ploy, or something antithetical to the filmmakers' philosophical aspirations.In the most indefatigable subtext, Black Panther is a story of the Black people working against their oppressors, within and outside - told by Ryan Coogler, an African American, a Black man, a Black director working in a very white Hollywood, within a literary world crafted by and serving a primarily white audience. As the box office numbers will attest, this is an intellectual (and, more importantly for white people, financial) coup for every facet of mainstream movie making. This is the mold-breaker of tokenism. Not only does it fulfill all vicarious expectations that would be required of white action, adventure, and fantasy tropes for a Black audience, but it makes those same tropes accessible, adoptable, and funky fresh for white audiences. You think the main villain is Andy Serkis? Bam! He's a Macguffin villain. You think Martin Freeman is a necessary character with agency? Bam! He's a Macguffin white savior of absolutely no consequence except to be window dressing for the Black power utopia.On the other side of the political aisle, Black Panther gives white nationalists all the vitriolic virtue signaling that they detest Hollywood for in the first place. The soundtrack is primarily African rhythms and hip-hop, and every major character is Black and indestructible. The major nationalistic debate of the fictional nation Wakanda is isolationism versus jingoistic, world-policing presumptions and condescension (that could in some perplexing esoteric context be mistaken for a parallel to American military interventionism). The final conflict ultimately comes down to Black on Black violence only reinforcing the presupposition that, absent the white man, none can bring a better homeostasis to our global economy, especially when a Utopian Black society is reduced to hand to hand combat via electromagnetic, neon nano-tech versus alloy-armored GMO rhinoceroses.Like so many movies, it all comes down to what you brought in with you to cinema. Are you ready to fight the man, or do you just want to shut your brain off? Or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that the mainstream media is a farce, dictating to the world what the powers that be think you need to think, yet never back up in any sort of sociopolitical policy outside of the cinema? Black Panther has it all folks. It's everything you want and not. It's so average that it transcends the amalgamation of all genres it inhabits. Truth be told, I yawned a lot, but it's good food for thought...and Hollywood inches ever closer to a satisfactory ""intersectional, progressive values"" to profit ratio."
"566",4,"  It's a good film, much better than Thor Ragnarok or Spiderman Homecoming. It's not reduced to a comedy film like Thor Ragnarok. Chadwick Boseman is awesome as T'Challa, also Michael B Jordan & other actors did a great job. It's filled with high octane action, great VFX & a good storyline. Dir Ryan Coogler has done a good job after Creed. Andy Serkis was hilarious, a very fine actor."
"567",1,"  Terrible movie, wanted to leave after the first 30min but I never leave the cinema without finishing a movie. I love superhero movies and was totally excited about this one, HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. My expectations were elevated by the RT score and its a total flop"
"568",4,"  There were certainly some nice messages held within this movie, in addition to good visuals and satisfying action sequences. Unfortunately, the plot is a fairly predictable one, being similar to other superhero movies I have seen."
"569",4,"  Well acted, written and directed. A great moral compass drives this film to be one of Marvel's best. Boseman shines and Jordan is a reckoning force. Beautifully shot and conceived. A true superhero film in every sense. 02-27-2018"
"570",2.5,"  Kind of boring, I found it lacking in action and the story line was too full of political crap."
"571",1,"  Horrible movie, wouldnt rec,The cast sucked the movie suckedit all sucked"
"572",4,"  Having always been a fan of the Pink Panther movies I was interested to see this new spin off. However, imagine my disappointment when I discovered it wasn't a slapstick heist / police detective movie but another addition to the ever expanding Marvel Universe! Once I got over my initial disappointment I found myself enjoying the story that began in Civil War where Black Panther was first introduced. Unlike other characters in the Marvel cinematic universe, this is a character I knew very little about and the film makers have done a decent job creating his back story as well as linking it with the central villain of the piece who was played well by Michael B. Jordan. The side villain Ulysses Klaue played by Andy Serkis was considered a little over the top by some but I enjoyed his performance and thought he played a suitably manic villain. The cast as a whole can not be faulted, there were some exciting set pieces, especially the car chase through the South Korea and a very decent story. At some point Marvel will run out of steam but they show no signs of slowing down yet and are still bringing interesting and exciting characters to the big and small screens.I think this current Marvel run will end or at least change somewhat after the events of Infinity War, I'm interested to find out if I am still enjoying their films afterwards."
"573",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing. I had super high expectations and felt that it exceeded everyone. I was seriously on the edge of my seat. This is definitely top 3 Marvel movie for me. It definitely competes with Civil War and Iron Man(1)"
"574",1,"  Don't believe the hype, it is a terrible substandard superhero movie."
"575",5,"  Really love this movie ????????"
"576",4,"  A really great movie! Lots of fun watching it! This isn't your typical superhero movie, in fact I would hesitate to even call it a superhero movie since it mostly centers around a conflict confined to one country. The action scenes are really cool and all of the characters and villains are really interesting. They also did a great job with all stunning and beautiful settings. This movie is very colorful and uses many diverse styles of architecture that really draw you into the movie. If there was anything I didn't like about the movie it was that it moved a little to fast in the beginning for my tastes and some of the typical disney/marvel brand humor moderately disrupted the flow at times.Now of course a movie like this is going to have some political themes as well (I mean it's BLACK PANTHER for God's sake) which speaking as someone who's moderately conservative and voted for Trump, I think they couldn't have done a better job! The movie actually started off surprisingly pro right-wing, emphasizing the importance of isolationism and displaying very socially conservative/traditionalist themes. Of course the movie's politics slowly shift more towards black power, which was satisfyingly not like the typical left-wing, victimhood, virtue-signaling that most overly progressive movies display today. Movies that do progressive politics wrong (i.e. star wars 8) could really learn a thing or two from this. It was really cool and even put a heavy emphasis on female empowerment through the heavily female body guards which were super cool to watch in the action scenes!It works so well because you don't feel like you're forcefed some overly diverse/female cast. You just legitimately like the characters and they work great together, which is pretty much the most you could ask for."
"577",4,"  Not the best Marvel I've seen but in the top 5 for sure"
"578",5,"  Honestly best film I've seen in a long time! Absolutely would recommend"
"579",4.5,"  OK I went and saw BP last night and all I can say is WOW! What a great movie. Not sure what the people are bitching about being political. I'm white, 56, conservative, voted for Donald Trump, and absolutely loved this movie. I mean if you want to say that some of this might be political, well so did many who went and saw Avatar but I was not one of those. It was just a great movie. LIke this guy: ThorZeroFeb 17, 2018Mediocre, don't bother with this movie. Decent special effects, boring with poor humor. Jump of the hype train. Never ride it.All I can say of this review is bullshit! This guy must of been going to the counter eating popcorn or something cause is stupid. T'Challa is full of love and not hate. This movie is love and not hate. T'Challa and Peter Parker was great in Captain America and were both my favorite in CA and it transferred over into this movie. Both Spider-Man and Black Panther are great movies."
"580",3.5,"  Great movie, not perfect. It didn't sit well with me that a civilisation so far advanced would be so insular and not do far more (even covertly) than they do for the incredibly poor nations around them. It didn't sit well that such a nation decides leaders through ritual combat to the death. It didn't sit well that such a nation thinks armored rhinos and spears are valid weapons (rhinos looked terribly fake too).But the characters were wonderful (loved Shuri) and the story suitably epic and the South Korea sequence great (although just because you disdain guns shouldn't mean bullets just ignore you).Liked the villains, my god villains that aren't soulless CGI monstrosities, DC could learn a thing or two there."
"581",5,"  Brilliant! CGI fight scene at the end were a bit sketchy, but strong cast and acting make it throughly enjoyable."
"582",4,"  Solid MCU offering that does far more than entertain. No weak links in the cast: Letitia Wright is a wonderful highlight as Shuri, Chadwick Boseman continues to be awesome. I really enjoyed this film. It's a good MCU story and mixes humour and tact over its role in groundbreaking for racial equality. Objectively, it's still a comic-book movie and won't help anyone with superhero fatigue but it's a great example of the genre and, finally, why diverse casting and story-telling has been long overdue in Hollywood. It only raises the bar in anticipation of the Infinity Wars. More like this please."
"583",0.5,"  Amazing visuals undercut by pretty much everything else about the movie, which is a shame, there was potential.Maybe next time."
"584",0.5,"  Did not enjoy the movie at all, the acting was sub-par with even worse CG than other Marvel movies."
"585",3,"  it's a cool movie but not that cool..."
"586",3,"  Uneven. Mismatched CGI against African exteriors. Nelson Mandela channelled beside the real Black Panthers. Another Marvel film where interest and emotion is sparked by the villains rather than the heroes."
"587",5,"  An excellent film. Powerful exposition, character development, and an actual tying into African culture(s). It's important that it takes place in an African nation where the people were never touched by slavery or colonialism. The Eric Killmonger character, his pain and internal conflict, is better than I could've imagined and will be discussed for years."
"588",3,"  Strong black and female characters dominate; its impressive tackling of political isolationism also makes it the right film at the right time. Unrealistic video-game violence significantly undermines impact, however. It's just too predictable now."
"589",5,"  I've seen Black Panther twice now and I loved it even more the second time around! The world building, the character development, the themes and the villian...loved it all! Wakanda forever!"
"590",1,"  BORRRIINNGGGGG.........."
"591",5,"  I loved it. I hope they have another one."
"592",5,"  The movie goes beyond special effects and action. The main characters are well developed and complex as well as the story line that is filled with historical and social references. I love that the films puts African themes in a futuristic setting (one wonders what Africa could have been like if it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its resources and labor). And I also love that it brings the racists out on social media who will look for reasons to denigrate or hate this movie??."
"593",2.5,"  I found the movie a bit boring to be honest. I always like the black panther character but the movie was underwhelming. especially after reading the hype by some people."
"594",2.5,"  As a movie critic, my chief responsibility is to tell you whether a given release is worth your time and money. While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie."
"595",5,"  This film has been a long time coming. Where Wonder Woman celebrates the strongest, most heroic, and fearless that women can be as superheroes while starring them, where Coco (and Book of Life) sincerely celebrates Mexican culture, Black Panther rises on a pedestal that embraces an amazing ensemble of actors and actresses doing justice by the characters they portray while glorifying the various elements and cultures of Africa through Wakanda. This is one of the better, if not best, Marvel film to come out yet, beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi, mystical fantasy, spy, drama, and action elements, standing out as more than a superhero story. While it focuses on Chadwick Boseman as an African King and his nation at a peak unlike anything imaginable, this film is also unafraid to call back to the real-life cruel histories of slavery, colonization, and centuries of racial oppression and discrimination through Killmonger, amazingly portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, who has now joined the tiers of great and compelling super villains like Ian McKellen's Magneto, Tom Hiddleston's Loki, and Heath Ledger's Joker. While a film like this has been a long time coming since Blade, I am actually glad it took this long to make a Black Panther movie because no other director, no other writers, no other team, no other studio in any previous time would have given Black Panther the dedication, the music, the characters, and story that would have done this superhero and Wakanda justice. Black Panther is not only possibly the best Marvel movie, it is also one of the best superhero movies period. Also, watch it in IMAX. It makes a real difference."
"596",3.5,"  It was decent. Maybe a bit too much hype. The rhinos were cool."
"597",0.5,"  Was expecting much more, nearly left half way thru...so slow on story development"
"598",3.5,"  Ganz nett, aber nicht der supergroße Wurf."
"599",3.5,"  I saw the movie yesterday and I have to say it was a great movie, but it was way to predictable. We've seen Black Panther in Civil War and in my opinion he was more awesome in Civil War than in his own movie. The movie also created to many questions. There were a lot scenes where I thought: wait how and why did this happened. Everybody was so hyped about it and especially about Killmonger, but I liked Ulysses Klaue more. In my opinion the movie could have been better. I give the movie a 76%"
"600",1,"  Terrible. Could have been a 4/4.5 star movie! Instead they had to throw in Social Justice multiple times during the movie, and turned the Farthest Right Wing hero into a raging leftists. Ruined the character and its pretty clear disney is going to ruin the Franchise."
"601",0.5,"  A fantasy what if movie. Attractive characters running around with no real focus or story. The whole thing comes off as a social justice psa with a watered down marvel twist. The movie does not leave any room or opening for any other super heros from the marvel franchise. This leads me to believe this will be another Edward Norton (Hulk) or Tobey Maguire (Spiderman) movie that will be remade and re-released to tweak the story to fit the franchise and hopefully get some substance. Basically a small portion of Africa has the same protective bubble that the Amazon s have in wonder woman...(real original). Inside the bubble are 5 tribes that basically fight for the right to rule the bubble. They have advanced technology and super smarts the perfect facade of Utopia. But all the advanced tools and tech is not enough to get them out of the tribal mindset so they have to fight and challenge to find the one man worthy to be King and thus the black panther. Surprised feminist haven't started rioting on that account. But to their credit they royal soldier force are made of woman. So long story short real history happens outside the bubble and the 5 tribes do nothing to circumvent things like slavery. Then in 92 a prince gets killed in America leaving an orphaned boy to be raised by the system. Turns out the boy does really well for himself is promoted through the us military and decides he wants the bubble for himself and then the world because he feels all black people are still slaves. He confronts the king of the bubble whose response is that black people in other countries are not citizens of the bubble just because of their skin color and thus not a priority. So the boy gets mad steals the throne for a few days with plans to liberate every black person around the world and end the colonization control. Anyone not black is seen as a colonizer and thus is oppressive to anyone black. As a stand alone movie I think it works, but if it's held up to the franchise, it is severely lacking."
"602",4.5,"  Thought i was great. I hope infinity war is great!!!"
"603",5,"  To all the people who are offended by this movie or think it's racist, it's completely not. It was one hell of a plot twist and shared an story adaptation. If you find this movie somewhat offensive either you are to dang sensitive or just looking to be offended."
"604",3,"  I THOUGHT IT WAS SLOW BUT MY TEENAGE SON LOVED SO IT WORTH IT BUT LIKED SPIDERMAN AND OTHERS BETTER"
"605",4,"  Black Panther amazes with stunning visuals, interesting characters, and an overall great experience. After 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally introduces a villain that has meaningful motivations yet is as evil as they come. Micheal B. Jordan delivers a remarkable performance and brings the role of Erik Killmonger to life. His performance as the main villain is by far the best part about the movie. The signature Marvel humor did pop up from time to time, but there was rarely an over-abundance of humor, it was well controlled and distributed throughout the movie, giving the movie a real dramatic feel. As great as the movie is, it is not one without flaws. For instance, the action sequences were great but were hard to keep up with due to the large amount of people fighting on screen at once. The action was reportedly inspired by 2015's Creed, which focuses on one on one combat, so it seems Ryan tried to bring that sort of action to the Black Panther film but frankly did not fit well with the film's large cast and battle sequences. Black Panther is the latest (as of Feb 2018) of films directed by Ryan Coogler and certainly does not disappoint."
"606",4.5,"  For a superhero movie, this was surprisingly deep and well-written. Very entertaining from start to finish, and an amazing script that criss-crosses real-world issues with fantasy, creating one of the best villains with the perfect shade of grey in Killmonger"
"607",4.5,"  With Creed director Ryan Coogler at the helm and some jaw-dropping cinematography from Mudbound's Rachel Morrison, Black Panther is a cut above the rest, a unique and original vision that could mark the dawn of a new era in studio filmmaking. It's also one of the MCU's best entries yet."
"608",5,"  Great movie. It was extremely well done and the story was very interesting as well. Great visual effects and lots of action with just enough humor that did not compromise the seriousness of the story."
"609",3.5,"  Really enjoyable superhero movie. Plot is pretty good, but not perfect. Some character motivations seem sketchy and forced, like the way one of the Wakanda tribes abandons all sense to support an outsider's challenge for the throne. And it's hard to rationalize the existence of super-advanced technology/medicine with a culture that accepts one-on-one mortal combat as a legitimate way to challenge and depose a new king. The acting is solid and the action is fun. Not sure how this expanded Marvel universe works, with so many powerful alternative worlds in co-existence (our world, Spiderman's, the X-Men's, Asgard, Wakanda, Dr. Strange's world, etc.). I favor the separate characters and separate imaginary worlds; I wish there wasn't always the push for supergroups when members come from alternative universes."
"610",0.5,"  Walked out at the hour mark. Bored out of my mind of this Iron Man mixed with ""James Bond"" thrown in (his sister is ""Q""). A challenge fight at last second that we all know main character will win, drug enhanced dreams of showing dead father speaking to him, and somehow missed an important artifact was stolen to eventually lead to showdown with the villain. I am completely dumfounded by the RT scores for this."
"611",3.5,"  Trigger Warning: A Caucasian individual is going to review Black Panther.Awe, yisss! The movie that one should take care in today's politicized climate...But y'know what? Let's set a racialized dialog aside and tackle this movie head on: it has its fun set-pieces in a rather scripted and derivative story arc. I wouldn't call it ""fresh"" or ""groundbreaking,"" but this movie is not without its charm. Chadwick Boseman steals the show with a persona mixed with calm aggression and warmth befitting a hero. In my eyes though, Winston Duke hit it out of the park with M'Baku. His delivery and take on this character evoked laughter from me, entertaining me to such a degree that I want to see a spin-off for his character. Danai Gurira's and Lupita Nyong'o's roles did not resonate as strongly as Boseman's and as such, their respective roles (Okoye and Nakia, respectively) failed to develop into fully formed characters worthy of attention. If anything, these characters existed to elevate Boseman's role even higher. Jordan's Killmonger was a flop for me - a slang-riddled opportunity that was wasted given Jordan's ability to perform well onscreen. I found his character to be a gauche clash with the immersive surroundings and as such, seeing him onscreen really took me out of the immersion. This is a sad reality given the amount of attention and care was put forth into building Wakanda as a living and breathing city. Andy Serkis though - man, can this guy mold into roles.Were there be threads of social commentary mixed in the screenplay? Sadly, yes and I did find myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. Is it obnoxious though? Not really and I did not find it to detract from the overall narrative. Does it live up to the hype? Honestly? I would say that it's better to see it on a cheap night: it did not resonate as strongly with me as previous Marvel outings and as such, I would not call this movie to be ""the best Marvel movie evar."" It is a solid 3.5/5. But seriously, Winston Duke....Man, I am impressed. ""Oooooh, Oooooh, Ooooooh"" - M'Baku.3.5 Colonizers out of 5."
"612",5,"  Awesome! I'm not familiar with the original comic but this movie was great! Lots of action, great story and an antagonist that you felt for. Must see!"
"613",5,"  Best MCU film. Period."
"614",5,"  I loved the character of Michael B. Jordan, I think is the greates enemy of the MCU until now. I loved to explore Wakanda through the movie and I even wanted to see more about it when the movie finished, hope we could see more about the city in Avengers Infinity War"
"615",5,"  Slow character build in beginning, but everything wrapped up nicely in the end and sets up the next line of movies..."
"616",5,"  Extremely mind blowing! Buff!! I want to re-watch it no matter what happened :)"
"617",1,"  A very overrated movie, over hyped and over well reviewed full of inconsistencies and some of the plot just doesn't make sense."
"618",4.5,"  Black Panther presents the MCU at its storytelling best thanks to deeply moving characters in all aspects, powered by a great performance from Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler's sure-handed direction."
"619",5,"  Black Panther is a stunning movie with impressive graphics and a thrilling soundtrack. It does a wonderful job of immersing its viewers in a futuristic country, rich with influences from beautiful tribes that we rarely get to see on screen. This culturally rich visual masterpiece is a must see for anyone"
"620",2,"  It's okay, that's it probably middle of the rung when it comes to Marvel. Better then Spider-Man worse then Thor 3. Michele B Jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the actors do fine. My only major complaint from a comic stand point is way to high tech and modern to be Wakanda should be more mystical feeling. Also Nakia kinda sucked but the actress did fine."
"621",5,"  My skin is clear, my crops are flourishing and edges HAVE RETURNED! Wakanda Forever!!!!"
"622",5,"  Really enjoyed this movie! Some very important messages here, not to mention a grear cast, and excellent special effects."
"623",2.5,"  I thought the costumes were great, but the pacing was super slow. I guess thats to be expected from an origins movie, but there are only like 4 action scenes in the whole movie and they are the type of action scene where there is a cut to a different close in camera angle before every punch. Seriously, you have over a 100 million dollar budget, the least you could do is hire a stunt coordinator for your ""action movie."" But dont get me wrong, I liked most of the characters, especially Killmonger who was pretty much the only character that wasn't one-dimensional. I dont know, guess I have just seen too many movies and this one was hyped up to be one of the best ever."
"624",3.5,"  Una movida muy arriesgada de parte de Marvel lanzarse este drama, pero les quedó bien."
"625",2.5,"  good acting, very good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable. i almost got up and walked out i got so bored around the middle of the movie. i just stayed to see how they would end it."
"626",4,"  I loved this movie, it had action, laughter, politics and romance!"
"627",4,"  Visually spectacular movie that had great story progression and character development. Loved the Africa-centric theme, what a breath of fresh air."
"628",5,"  Superhero action flick, nuanced social commentary or exceptional example of diversity and positive culturalism...this film is all things for all people"
"629",5,"  This movie was amazing! Great cast and great actors. I've been excited for this one since Captain America: Civil War and it did not disappoint."
"630",2,"  Overrated popcorn flick. Just didn't do it for me."
"631",5,"  Chadwick Boseman returns to don the power and suit of the Black Panther. This time in his own movie! After his father died, T'Challa finds himself in a novelty path of becoming what it is to be a true king of Wakanda but while being thwarted by something that was created a long time ago, an adversary by blood. The dark past catches up in T'Challa's life and not just him, but everyone around him are in danger. With the help of the people he trusts and love, the kingdom must be saved.Despite of what everyone is claiming it to be and don't get me wrong, this is by far the best Marvel comic book movie adaptation ever. Thor Ragnarok was just the tip of the iceberg, bridging and weaving in the story to our ultimate goal: Infinity War. Black Panther is what I hoped for and while I expect nothing less of the movie, the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow. Michael B. Jordan as the super villain known as Killmonger did a superb job and I must say, he totally redeem himself from that other Marvel movie he was in. So I deem him one of our greatest super villains in the MCU. Lupita Nyong'O as Nakia, Danai Gurira as Okoya, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, and last but not least Letitia Wright as Shuri, all did so frickin' awesome with their performances! I can see why everyone loves Shuri and it's understandable but man oh man, Chadwick Boseman outdone himself again as the Black Panther. His first appearance in Captain America: Civil War was truly great and seeing him in his own solo movie as Black Panther is without a doubt another superb performance. Can't wait to see him to continue the role in Infinity War. Hopefully we can get another sequel? Maybe even two more? Black Panther is actually one of my favorite characters in the Marvel comic book universe, so would love to see more of him. Let's not forget Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. He did more than we thought he could do in the film and he kicked ass. Glad to see he has enough spotlight as everyone else did. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue was such titular villain that seeing his performance with the character was a great treat.Black Panther is a comic book movie from Marvel Studios that you can not miss. If you're on a journey like the rest of us who watched since the very first build up from the very beginning, then you know that it's just the beginning for these beloved Marvel characters. With Infinity War coming real soon, our hype is just growing by the day."
"632",5,"  Great movie. Great characters."
"633",1.5,"  The movie is possibly a little better in languages other than english. I found it boring. The movie languishes without the movie's best actor Jordan. The stars are only for the car chase scene."
"634",1,"  Sheeit this movie worst"
"635",5,"  Amazing, Groundbreaking film. This is a must see. Don't let it pass you by."
"636",5,"  Writer and Director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" is awesome. Although, only February ""Black Panther"" is my favorite movie this year. More than just a Marvel superhero translation, ""Black Panther"" shall be Hollywood's reckoning. We all want to to see movies with big ideas, about diverse stories and cultures, and the journey that makes one greater.Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan are amazing as defining others- T'Challa (Black Panther) and Erik Stevens. Heroes like Chadwick have power in their tears, their compassion. Villains like Michael are both lightness and darkness in profound suffering and noble purpose. Theirs is the defining conflict that distinguishes ""Black Panther"" as it touches your heart and inspires your soul."
"637",3.5,"  The MCU has done a good job of making it's films pop, and that's exactly what this movie does. While there is a shortage of action, and the black culture is a bit obnoxious, this is a competent film. Is this a movie you will watch 4 years from now and say "" That was a masterpiece"" ? Probably not. But it does succeed as being a fun, enjoyable superhero flick."
"638",4,"  Black Panter was a visual masterpiece for Marvel. From the creation of Wakanda, to it's people and culture, and the chosen colour pallet. A bright, bold choice of visuals.It's plot, however was subpar. Black Panther draws of the rise of a fallen king story, which has been killed, reborned, and killed again by Hollywood."
"639",5,"  best movie of 2018 so far.i loved every part of this movie,it was really action packed."
"640",4.5,"  Wonderful film, and a fantastic addition to the Marvel slate of movies. Loved it!"
"641",0.5,"  Just another reskined"
"642",5,"  Needed to see what's all the hype. The movie was good from start to finish. It held my attention, and I'm not a person that care for action movies. The scenes and actors were great, kept me at the edge of my seat. Worth seeing twice."
"643",4,"  One of the best of the MCU, the action is great, the humor is enjoyable yet not insufferable like some other Marvel productions, the script may be a little predictible but the performance and the overall message of the movie makes up for it."
"644",1,"  This movie has great reviews because the cast is black, the director is black and the writers are black. Everyone is afraid to say it's only a mediocre Marvel film because of that. It's no better than any of the Spiderman or Fantastic 4 films - in fact some of the CGI and most of the script is very subpar. On top of being exuberantly antiwhite and grotesquely metapolitical (huge distraction from mostly 'meh' film), the movie is just a middle of the road action flick and just another Marvel event. I found myself intensely disliking this movie."
"645",2.5,"  Highly overrated, presumably due to the political implications surrounding the film. If you review this solely as a film it simply misses the mark on what could have been something great.The world building would have been more believable if they had bothered to build real complete sets and avoided such an over reliance on CGI. Sadly by the third act it becomes a mess of CGI and we do not even get a decent end battle between the Boseman and Jordan. Is it really to much to ask for some real fight choreography and stuntwork?Performances are great however from the cast , Boseman does well but feels like he's not given enough time to shine in his own film.Jordan is fine but far from the fantastic villain other reviewers have proclaimed killmonger to be.Serkis is great as always and chews up the scenary.Freeman is pretty much pointless and should have been left out of the film."
"646",4.5,"  This movie was so much fun. Loved it. after the first 30 minutes it really kicked into high gear and i was fixed. great story. great origin. great world created and systems created. great villain with a great back story and motive. what a fascinating character kill monger was. i loved the story of someone who was radicalized. so well done. Michael B Jordan was phenomenal as kill monger. and Andy Serkis as Klau. Charisma just oozing off the screen. he need more real life roles. why was chadwick boseman whispering or yelling the whole movie. kind of annoying. the accents were all over the place. a little distracting.i never freeze - lame character development attempt that never played out. the green screen when Tchalla sees his ancestors when gets is covered in snow while in the coma. the echo sound effect really shows you the green screen. which maybe is acceptable because it is heaven or something. but it read as green screen.why did the guy from 'get out' surrender to the female warrior? story didnt readi never got any closure with the wakandans? mom returning? t'challa dealing with the guy from get out?how did he survive that fall? not buying it.what move did tchalla do to win the battle at the end? that michael b jordan said nice move and the fighting wskindo f hidden and literally dont know what the climatic action moment of the movie was. does the US not care that those wakandan planes were flying all over oakland?"
"647",5,"  Fantastic movie! Plenty of cheering throughout and audience applauding at the end!"
"648",2,"  Typical, weak plot, poor acting."
"649",0.5,"  This movie was way over hyped. There are a lot of marvel movies that I would rather watch. This is towards the bottom of what Marvel has done."
"650",4,"  Zips along nicely and a great addition to the MCU."
"651",5,"  The five stars is due to the fact that I expected the MCU formula and was pleasantly surprised instead.Loved it. Great characters all around. Especially refreshing to see a complex, three-dimensional villain for the first time in an MCU movie.I loved the fact that it wasn't preachy at all. The female and black characters felt like real and likeable people and not like artificial tools to send a PC message.Thematically it is also the best MCU film by far."
"652",3,"  With all of the hype I was really expecting a better superhero movie. I get the attention, it is a cool story with originality and it has a very timely subject matter... but the execution, the action, the CGI and the story telling was WAY under par for the critical acclaim. You can obsess over it for political reasons or whatever, as a superhero movie I think there are many better ones out there. (IronMan 1, Avengers, Dark Night, Capt America Civil War)"
"653",5,"  This movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite MCU movie along side the winter soldier, but as a stand-alone movie this is where this movie goes above and beyond. The message is clear and this movie gives you a lot to think about. Great job Ryan Coogler and an amazing cast for this achievement!"
"654",3,"  Puntaje Original: 6.0Visualmente atractiva, con un formidable uso del color y remarcable diseño de producciÃ³n y de vestuario. Black Panther tiene una gran premisa para convertirse en un gran exponente del cine de superhÃ©roes, pero se pierde en chistes desencajados, pobre desarrollo de personajes y la marcada deficiencia cinematogrÃ¡fica del MCU."
"655",3.5,"  Quality film, I think it's good but it could have been a touch better with minor tweaks. Some will call it the best Marvel movie ever and for some people they may see it that way. It's got cultural significance, there's a lot to like. I loved the supporting cast more than the main characters. I saw it in 3D AVX and I don't know that 3D added much to it. I'll give people who are going to see it this advice, it's pacing is somewhat uneven, even slow and most of the film is dialogue driven. Don't expect it to blow you away but be confident you'll enjoy the experience."
"656",2,"  i saw the movie. it's a weird movie, it wasn't bad, but not as good as any of the previous marvel movies. the black folks lived in a country with very unstable government (all you need to do to be leader with real political power is defeat the existing leader in combat), they are totally reliant on one form of resource, and for some reason they believe they are oppressed (spolier alert)-at the end of the movie, a Wankandian said something along the lines of-i'd die than living in bondage, like my ancestors-Wakanda was never conquered by European settlers, all wakandians lived in secrecy, how could his ancestors have been slaves??the action scenes weren't as good for Marvel standards"
"657",5,"  Great movie. It's a fresh new take and a little bit different from the previous marvel outings."
"658",3,"  It was a good film, but it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be."
"659",2.5,"  It's ok, but far from the best MCU film as some say. In fact it still follows the same tired Marvel formula. It actually took a lot of plot points from Thor Ragnarok which is why I can't give it more than a 4. Marvel needs to start giving us more expansive and diverse stories, and not just the same stories told in a slightly different way. This film did the same thing Doctor Strange did with Iron man."
"660",5,"  What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!"
"661",4,"  Breaking box office records, does Black Panther live up to the hype? Sort of. It is certainly a good film that will result in a fine time at the cinema, but to say it's better than other MCU movies would be a stretch. After an appearance in the recent Captain America movie, Civil War, Chadwick Boseman returns to the big screen donning the Black Panther outfit. This time he is ascending to the throne of Wakanda, the third world African nation that isn't all it seems from the outside. Boseman does an adequate job creating the legend called the Black Panther, also known as T'Challa; he is both a force to be reckoned with and a balanced character with quiet intellect and noble ambition. However, T'Challa lacks the charisma of a Captain America or Tony Stark and his character over the course of the film is rather static. This makes him more of a plain superhero in a dope suit. This also leads to many scenes being stolen from him; you likely will remember scenes from the movie because of something someone else said or did. The women surrounding T'Challa, in particular, deserve credit for distinguishing themselves as independent, unique characters that serve as more than the typical female love interest. Danai Gurira (Walking Dead fans will know her as Michonne) plays Okoye, a strong leader of an all-female security/military regiment; her intensity in the role may come off as overly serious, but I think it makes her character more intimidating. Letitia Wright plays Shuri, the younger sister of T'Challa who plays a Lucius Fox-esque role, always looking to improve and create the tech that makes Black Panther so strong. Her playfulness with T'Challa and lively spirit help to lighten the mood. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia, who is an untraditional love interest who plays hard to get with T'Challa. The standout of the film, however, is Michael B. Jordan, who plays the menacing antagonist Killmonger with a hunger for vengeance. Jordan is magnetic in the role and one of the more compelling, complicated villains I have seen in this type of movie. What makes Killmonger a special antagonist is that his anger is both understandable and reasonable. His grand statements are based on sensible arguments and his goals go beyond simply taking over the world. I only wish his role in the movie was more prominent. Other performances of note include Andy Serkis, who is fun to watch as baddie Ulysses Klaue; Martin Freeman, who pretty much ends up playing Martin Freeman, and Daniel Kaluuya, the Get Out star, who goes underused in the movie and doesn't add much to the story. Beyond the performances, there are plenty of things to like in Black Panther. The score is solid, driven by the sound beat of a drum and African chorals. I am a fan not only of the Black Panther suit but think the costumes (and makeup) all around were very well done and served as vibrant shows of African culture. However, the movie relies heavily on CGI which I thought at times was too noticeable. My bigger problem, however, was the large-scale battle towards the end of the film which becomes a hectic CG fest. There is a lot going on, but the excess of visuals does little to enhance the film other than to amplify the action. It becomes the same saturated mess that quite frankly, I am tired of watching. The more intimate fights for the throne that take place on a waterfall(?), are much more interesting; each punch and stab is felt by the audience and in turn, you become more engaged in what is happening. Although infrequent, these fights are the best moments in the movie. Unfortunately, one of those fights is not the final showdown between T'Challa and Killmonger. Black Panther is a solid film that, without a doubt, will entertain. Nonetheless, the film has imperfections. It is a bit predictable, the main protagonist isn't particularly interesting, and the ending turns into a conventional, superhero frenzy without the personal connection great superhero movies like Logan have. I certainly recommend seeing Black Panther, but calling it a tad overrated is not out of the question."
"662",2.5,"  Another average marvel movie with nothing new or special to offer. A decent popcorn movie to watch but nothing better to offer compared to other Marvel movies."
"663",5,"  They were able to separate the Black Panther from all of the other Avengers and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining. Can't wait to see it again!"
"664",0.5,"  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
"665",1,"  Really bad movie! Nothing like other Marvel movies. Dragged on and on. Don't believe the hype!"
"666",4,"  An African Bond/Superhero film with a great ""bad' guy...it continues Marvel amazing streak"
"667",2.5,"  I personally liked it but the characters with the exception of Kill-monger were pretty bland and it had many flaws overall I would put it behind Spider man homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok"
"668",3.5,"  One of the best of the Marvel superhero movies I've seen. I wasn't familiar with the Black Panther going in so the storyline development was useful. There are several characters that are well developed, including the primary villain. And a lot of the characters were strong women, which is good to see. A lot of CGI, but that comes with the territory. Go see it if you haven't already. Tuesday afternoon is a good time to see this crowd pleaser. Had the place to ourselves (well almost)."
"669",0.5,"  Over-hyped and full of reverse racism."
"670",5,"  Was amazed by the quality, scope and vision on the first viewing.The second viewing was even better - a closer inspection reveals the power of subtext and thought provoking nuance."
"671",5,"  AMAZING FILM! A MUST WATCH!"
"672",4.5,"  great, one of the best things to come from marvel in a while"
"673",2,"  Killmonger is great! But BP is so boring - I'm just not interested in another dull male upholding traditional, monarchical values. Particularly not when the otherwise excellent female characters are there just to swoon over him. MOAR KILLMONGER - an actual character with personality and motivation!"
"674",5,"  Black Panther has transcended the cookie cutter Marvel franchise. In seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of African culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world. Set designs, costumes, music. In that context it places complex characters, and lets the audience experience with them the unfolding of unexpected information about people close to them. Lets the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations. Villains with complexity. Heroes with complexity. Layered story lines. So many characters doing the unexpected. This movie raises the bar for anyone attempting to adapt a comic book to the screen."
"675",3.5,"  very solid movie but definitely over hyped. Michael B is quite a unique character and a villain that hasn't really be presented in theatres yet in the Marcel universe. Boseman was pretty solid as well as the supporting cast.was hoping for a little unexpected plot twists as everything was pretty foreseeable but all in all, cinematography and character development were solid for a first installment."
"676",2,"  BLACK PANTHERwas good but not the be all its being made out to be.There was very little action and the messaging was very heavy handed and it also felt like the people who made this relied on a lot of African stereo types i.e the plate lip thing that was a practice that was started to put off the white slavers they didn't want unattractive slaves and in this wakanda has been isolated for millennia so why would this have been part of there culture because it sure made talking an issue lol the film was over long and they didn't film any of it in Africa wtf"
"677",4,"  a breath of fresh air within the MCU. Could seemingly become a fan favorite of the genre."
"678",5,"  Great place Wakanda.. Cool technology"
"679",5,"  One of the best Marvel movies ever since Spider-Man Homecoming."
"680",5,"  I went to see Black Panter twice! and I would really like to go see it again. It was amazing, the settings, the costumes were glorious, the pace of the movie, the actors were amazing in their costumes! wardrobe, whatever you wish to call it. It was a lot of fun and what movies should be all about, a time for escaping reality and going into a fantasy world! oh what a fantasy world that is Wakanda. I can't say enough abou this movie, except I will go see it again. Even if you are not a super Marvel comic fan you will be able to follow this film.. Greatness! Enjoy!"
"681",1,"  I was so hyped after watching the trailer, but the movie was a big letdown... story was boring and so were the fights. The SJW are probably deleting all the negative reviews. Or maybe its just me and my friends who thought this movie was awful."
"682",5,"  Most amazing movie ever. EVER!! EVER!!!!"
"683",5,"  Great movie. I'm a big Marvel fan and this is one of the greatest."
"684",4,"  It was good but the Hype created too much of high expectations. Not better than the Dark Night, LOTR, Star Wars, and many other Classics. Black Panther is NOT a classic on the making"
"685",5,"  Unlike any other superhero film there is a great message in this film so powerfull, it will make you cry."
"686",2.5,"  Buen fondo cultural, buen diseño, buen arte pero una historia tan boba como su protagonista que no logra imprimirle la fuerza de la Pantera Negra al personaje ni por los tobillos, parece un super hÃ©roe Teenager. El villano Andy Serkis es un fracaso total y Martin Freeman mal, como casi siempre, en su papel de Hobbit que no superarÃ¡."
"687",4.5,"  Black Panther was awesome. As a huge DC fan who tends to not like the MCU because its too goofy, it works out well in this movie. Great cast and a great story make Black Panther a great movie. Killmonger ended up being a great villain, one of the MCU's best."
"688",5,"  Marvel's new headlight. Black Panther stole our wigs. Wakanda is a Marvel in itself."
"689",5,"  Saw this today. Another great marvel film. Very enjoyable"
"690",4,"  Visually beautiful, well acted, and stuffed to the brim with technology that made my eyes and mind dazzle. I want to live in a world where Wakanda is real.Some of the action and plotting felt a little stale but everything else about the movie is a wonderful breath of fresh air."
"691",4.5,"  Great movie OK, I am all in.. Black Panther might be the best rendition of a super hero ever <3 (Y) 3:) am I allowed to say that I have a total crush on the female lead of the King Guard.. what a powerfully beautiful woman.. and damn, what a fighter.. an Amazon lives"
"692",4.5,"  Beautifully done. I mean literally beautiful, so much eye popping visuals the story is a TAD thin. This matters not though as the characters make up for it. Everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time making it. Some plot holes and inconsistencies, but if you ignore the fact that Wakanda is LITERALLY ""Atlantis"" and not just a secret nation, but a totally alien one, then you will have a great time watching it. Interested to see how the tech in Wakanda changes the world in the MArvel universe, will it affect MAOS and the Netflix stories, because the tech is even more impossible than what Tony Stark has! All in all a truly enjoyable movie to watch."
"693",3,"  Everyone should see at least once. Many of my family and friends have already seen it multiple times"
"694",5,"  Wow Amazing ?? out of sight ??????"
"695",3,"  I saw this on 2-26-18. The action scenes and bits of humor were good. I loved the tech and costumes designs. They were absolutely stunning and made sense for the area. The culture of Wakanda felt real too.My problem was the main villain, Killmonger. He was just a one note stereotype that's been seen time and time again."
"696",4.5,"  I loved the world of Wakanda and the amazing characters, especially the bad ass female characters. The story is a bit convoluted and dragged at times, but I still couldn't wait to get back into the Wakanda world and see it again."
"697",2.5,"  Even if you ignore all the social media hoopla, 'Panther' could have been so much better. Marvel seems to have topped out creatively with ships and buildings that are unique to Wakanda are not so unique to the MCU. There are plot issues and leaps in logic (other than willing suspension of disbelief). Hopefully, his second outing will flow and entertain better than the first. Not a bad movie, just not good enough to watch again."
"698",4,"  What makes Marvel's ""Black Panther"" such a breath of fresh air is the creative visual style and character focused storytelling. I really liked all of the characters in this movie and the motivations were clear. Coogler truly has made a movie that really can't be compared to any other movie currently in the MCU. I feel this movie showcased one of the best villains Marvel is had recently with Michael B. Jordan. I understood his frustrations and motivations and thought he was very compelling. The downside is that he really isn't in the movie for very long. I thought this was a missed opportunity since his character was so interesting to me. This is a very character-focused movie, which in the end makes it impressive, but it also hinders some of the pacing in the first half and a few segments dragged for me. This is still a first-rate Marvel movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. The story is unique and visually stunning and the actions scenes are all excellent. There is one chase scene, in particular, that is very well done and the finale is also breathtaking. All in all the movie is a joyous celebration of African culture and a captivating, character-driven story that will please Marvel fans who are looking for something different."
"699",4,"  This is a beautifully crafted film that will resonate with different people of different backgrounds. It is a very complex and well laid out story, and the visuals are spectacular."
"700",5,"  Unbelievable. Total game changer for the MCU, just like when GOTG Vol 1 came out. GO SEE THIS"
"701",5,"  Really loved it. Unique and aesthetically wonderful, and some of the most badass women in movie history! Thank you so much for making it."
"702",4,"  Good Entertainment, after awful SWLJ"
"703",2.5,"  Superhero wasn't Super! Why make the main character so weak? Was saved by his general at the beginning, almost lost his first fight, did lose his second fight, and with his years of training as the black panther certainly wasn't super against a newbie at the end. The panther was so much better in civil war...I lay all the fault at the director. The general was the best character in the film by far."
"704",5,"  This is the best movie ever, more than a simple movie this is an experience of an afro embrace of the future, the progressive reality of a new tomorrow. This is a beautiful victory for diversity and justice and a punch in the face of the evil axis of the alt-right nazi bigots. Wakanda forever! down with Whitey."
"705",5,"  Visually stunning, exceptional ,remarkable in every other way ,so much chemistry between every character and showing the talents of every actor in the movie and Ryan Coogler and wanting to see so much more of Michael B Jordan in the future."
"706",5,"  Faz tempo que a Marvel não fazia um vilÃ£o tÃ£o bom e com tanta motivaÃ§Ã£o. Filme indispensÃ¡vel para quem gosta do ""gÃªnero"". RecomendadÃ­ssimo."
"707",1.5,"  Black Panther is an extremely derivative Marvel movie that suffers from the same things as all the other MCU movies including, but not limited to, distracting humor, headache-inducing CGI, and too much self-indulgence."
"708",4,"  La nueva entrega del MCU, ""Black Panther"", brinda una mirada objetiva en la lucha de intereses políticos que presenta a travÃ©s de sus dos personajes principales: T'Challa, como el nuevo y benevolente Rey de Wakanda; y Killmonger, como un asesino calculador que tiene su propia agenda con los recursos y tecnologÃ­a de la naciÃ³n. La fortaleza del film, por tanto, recae en las motivaciones que hacer rodar las acciones de cada personaje, resaltando el protagÃ³nico rol que las mujeres cumplen dentro y fuera de la pelÃ­cula, un hecho que definitivamente le aÃ±ade mucha fuerza a esta propuesta del cine de superhÃ©roes. Siendo objetivo, a la pelÃ­cula solo se le podrÃ­a hacer una observaciÃ³n en particular...y en realidad, esto se genera por la sofocante publicidad que el film tuvo, sobre promocionar a la pelÃ­cula como la mÃ¡s ""diferente"" del UCM. Sin embargo, la primera mitad del film sigue una estructura convencional de cualquier pelÃ­cula del gÃ©nero. Y es a partir de la segunda mitad, con la inserciÃ³n de un villano bien construido, que la pelÃ­cula comienza a andar por una ruta mÃ¡s interesante. Empero, esto no le desmerece todos los aspectos tÃ©cnicos que uno ya puede esperar de una entrega de este universo cinematogrÃ¡fico, entre los cuales, resaltan el vestuario, la mÃºsica, la ediciÃ³n y fotografÃ­a de Wakanda.En pocas palabras, ""Black Panther"" es la pelÃ­cula previa al inicio del fin de las primeras fases del UCM, que posee mayor personalidad y distinciÃ³n, que puede ser analizada por lo que es y sin recaer en innecesarios empleos de conexiÃ³n con las otras pelÃ­culas de Marvel Studios."
"709",5,"  This is how superhero movies should be done. The Wakandan characters are well-rounded and interesting; you actually care about what happens to them. Even the villain is a dynamic character who blurs the lines between right and wrong. Overall, a great film worth seeing more than once."
"710",1.5,"  An entertaining romp that ultimately feels a bit hollow. Plot holes mean it will have less re-watchability in the long run"
"711",4.5,"  Black Panther, the eighteenth MCU movie, is a thrilling, emotional, and fun ride that stands as a top-tier Marvel film. The story is all about T'Challa, and his struggle to be a noble king. Along comes Killmonger, played nicely by Jordan who wants the throne for himself. The cast is great, with Boseman doing a good job. The visuals are solid, though some of the effects could use some work. The pacing is fine, and the second act is the best. The third act loses some momentum but overall it ends on a deeply personal note that makes up for it. Black Panther is a great entry into the MCU and is my fifth favorite one behind Civil War, Guardians, Spider-Man Homecoming, and Age of Ultron. Now please give me Infinity War."
"712",2.5,"  Cool visuals and soundtrack. Other than that it's a basic Marvel flick littered with plot holes. The user rating doesn't lie, it's just not that good. I also don't think the message translates well to the real world, but hey maybe their is a hidden advanced city in Africa. Please take everything I say with a grain of salt and factor in who I am, what I know, what I don't know and who I'm not."
"713",4.5,"  Black Panther features great characters, great designs, a great score, and it has an unusual amount of depth and drama when comparing it to Marvels latest outings. These aspects, plus great performances all around, make it overcome the fact that the plot is a little predictable and the action is a bit underwhelming."
"714",5,"  Here's hoping this movie will teach all the right lessons..."
"715",2,"  Dont believe the hype. Mediocre avenger movie, mediocre actors. The others were much better."
"716",0.5,"  0/10 too many black people"
"717",4,"  Black Panther (Movie Review)..""this is a spoiler-free review, don't worry! you're safe with me.""...I have to say, this has been a wonderful 10 years for the Marvel Cinematic Universe...This film was great, it's not that perfect but it's amazing. Thomas and I were really hoping that the storyline for Black Panther would be very intreresting, and it hit our expectations just right....I'm not going to describe the film's flaws, I'm just here to explain what I felt when we watched the film..The one thing that I really liked about this movie was the ""pacing"", because it built up certain characters, and the plot was given piece by piece to the audience like it is an important thing for the next ""Avengers"" film, and when the climax was happening you would actually care for the characters...Especially for the main villain here, I have to be honest with you, the main antagonist was an absolute necessary in the storyline. Because he has a reason why he's doing all of these bad things, even though he's on the wrong side, you could actually see him as a human being...And that is what I call ""Good Writing"", the writers in this film really focused on the ""characters"", because they wanted you to root for ""Black Panther"" when ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is already happening....I think all of them did a pretty good job in making the ""MCU"" films. I don't know...I mean, I don't know how they do it...Because NONE of the MCU films were awful, every single one of them was either ""great"" or ""okay""......I can't say anything else, please, go see this film if you have free time...It's worth it!.I'm going to give ""Black Panther"" a solid ""9 out of 10"""
"718",3,"  INTRODUCTION:This was a pretty good show. Not as good as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1, or Ant Man, but pretty good. And it's definitely way better than The Last Jedi, but that's not saying much.THE GOOD:* Very cool presentation of Wakanda* Interesting to see how the Black Panther transitions to new people* Great to see an advanced African culture* The characters and acting were greatTHE BAD:* The main villain wasn't really somebody I hated; he was too sympathetic* Not super funny, like some of the other Marvel shows, and that's probably okay; not every movie needs to be stand-up comedy (*cough* *cough* - The Last Jedi); so maybe disregard this comment* Don't really have a desire to watch it again; it was good, but not that good; but I wouldn't avoid it; it's a good movie, but for me, it's just not blow-my-socks-off awesomeCONCLUSION:Overall, I enjoyed the show, but not sure I'd put it on as high a pedestal as some have. For me, I think the movie was definitely a good, high quality show, but without a strong urge to re-watch. For me, it kind of ranks there with Captain America: The First Avenger."
"719",4,"  This movie is good by far but it is not as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says. This movie is fun and all but it is not as good as other marvel movies such as civil war. The villain is okay and predicable but did have potential. T'challa did not grow very much in the movie but gave some good action. I did like this movie not to bash it but it was not as good as most of the others. Max I could give it is 4 stars."
"720",5,"  I saw this movie and it was amazing. The special effects were next level. I also really enjoyed the fact that the cast was mostly black. It was also interesting to see traditional African cultures meet the high tech advanced Wakanda in an action packed adventure."
"721",5,"  A great superhero film carried by its directing and cast. This is one of the best looking movies, marvel has ever done.. The action, through scarce, is very well done and very riveting. Overall this well directed movie is one of the best marvel has to offer"
"722",5,"  OMG!!!! Amazing. The action, emotion, scenery, make up and costumes, character development.... My top Marvel movie right now!"
"723",1,"  Totally Overrated - No Plot, bad CGI, bad Movie."
"724",2.5,"  Well, the movie is not bad, but being a Marvel flick it comes across a bit weak. Especially compared to the last one, Thor Ragnarok, it's incredibly weak. Sure, there are cool fighting scenes with spears (it's Africa, right?!) and even an OK battle, but as a whole it does not convince. Besides that, the visual quality when there are scene swipes from one side to the other is surprisingly poor, even perturbing your eyes (even more so in 3D or so). All in all, it's watchable, but nothing to brag about. 5/10 points."
"725",3.5,"  The screenplay adaptation of Stan Lee's comic novel seems very accurate. As an introductory movie, Black Panther gives the character a strong backdrop of his history and origins. The actors all pull off amazing performances, enhanced by a strong use of CGI. The movie puts across the significance of many cultural and humanitarian principles, as most Stan Lee's superhero's strive to do, yet social topics throughout the movie could be referenced with more empathy. The script writing for dialogue seems poor, and the implicit nature of feminist and cultural (west vs africa, white vs black, ). The amount of emphasis of Wakanda's superior technology, fuelled by vibranium, wares thin and cringey as the film progresses (not to mention how the Wakandan's are actually a rather hostile people, formed of many tribes, all reluctant to share either the knowledge or material resources.) Although the action scenes are well worth giving this movie watch. Overall a good watch, but one to take with a pinch of salt when listening to any means of this trying to bridge social-cultural gaps."
"726",3,"  see, its called democracy..Black PantherAn alluring and beguile world, fancy technology, mythically inherent rituals and a knack for projecting breathtaking action sequences are the high points of this feature that is not only supported but celebrated by the IMAX screen. Black Panther is raw non-volatile feature that begrudges and empowers the humanness in it despite of its ""superness"" but is confined within a territory that is loosely placed on over 134 minutes of runtime stretching its way to create something colossal out of just a mere idea. Ryan Coogler puts all his chips in to create this huge act and is convincing throughout the course of it but is somewhat restrained by the script that is familiar to the viewers. Chadwick Boseman tries a lot to overpower the other actors opposite him but there is something that just doesn't feel like ""king"" to us yet, whilst on the other hand he is supported by some of the finest talents like Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o and other cameos that holds tightly onto their parts. Black Panther takes its time to settle in; especially its first act, and reaches for the bigger bite on its second act which is quite interesting as the plot thickens and politics gets in but all of that is barely around us before the last act arrives which is not only predictable but also seems a bit long."
"727",4.5,"  It was a great story with an incredibly nuanced villain that demonstrated the historic dynamic between Africans and African Americans. The costumes were amazing and the action was incredible. If you can, go see it in 3D or 4D."
"728",0.5,"  i rate this movie 1/10 cus it bad. And has bad story telling, bad action scene and in all is a marvel movie so bad."
"729",3,"  I read on social media, that angry DC fans are trying to sabotage this film here on Rotten Tomatoes. I can assure you that I am not a angry DC fan and I am writing this review only after having seen the film. As I said, I am not a DC fan and I am not a Marvel fan either. I am just your average movie goers, who goes to watch films in expectation of entertainment and perhaps a couple of life-lessons to take away home.I didn't expect life-lessons from Black Panther, only entertainment, which I feel it failed to deliver. You don't need angry DC fans for this film to write bad reviews, this film is capable of doing that on it's own!I can't tell you much about the story because I couldn't understand half of what they were speaking because I wasn't able to get through their thick accents. The movie theatre didn't even have the decency to provide subtitles.Black Panther feels like two different films in its two different halves. The things that happen in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half. The action sequences were amazing and the I loved the long continuous take of fighting sequences, but as I said none of that mattered in the long run.The second half is where I started to gain interest, but it wasn't enough. Erik Killmonger was a decent villain played decently by Michael B. Jordan. The plot devices so save our heroes were pretty obvious. The last fight sequence fell flat for me.Brand me a racist if you want, I can't say that I liked Black Panther. Maybe it was the hype that was generated around this film or it was just a bad film I don't know. I regret spending my money and wasting my time on it."
"730",4.5,"  This movie does a great job of expanding the Marvel brand into uncharted territories, and connecting with an audience on numerous levels. I found myself wanting to dig deeper into character motivations, primarily those of T'Challa and N'Jadaka (Killmonger). Ultimately, this kept me locked in to the evolution of the plot. I'd go 87/100. NIce!"
"731",1.5,"  The worst marvel movie besides civil war, the plot was boring and was overwhelmed by the effort to give it a social complaining, the angles of the camera were lazy and tchalla was a boxing bag"
"732",3,"  It's neither a dumb supehero movie, nor a strong, politically heavy film. Apart from some really good work with the characters like Ulysses Klaue, which was my favorite, Black Panther is a standard sci-fi/action/adventure with predictable storytelling and average cg and action."
"733",5,"  Anyone who knows me knows I'm one of the harshest MCU critics. So don't take this lightly & believe me when I say this, ""Black Panther"" is a true masterpiece.The costume design department did a terrific job of encompassing clothing styles from different African cultures & blending them with some slick modern touches thus creating some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the MCU has ever sewn.A film such as this one is unavoidably CGI-heavy. So a special care must be taken into smoothing everything & mixing it all together. This film, albeit the final battle which looked a bit cartoonish, did so meticulously. The way Wakanda's technological advancements are presented is a sight to be seen & the attention to even the smallest detail is something I always highly appreciate.The score or soundtrack, in my opinion, is one of the most critical aspects of a film. It can single-handedly destroy, pass through unnoticed or elevate a film. I must admit, going in & by the very few promotional materials I had watched beforehand, I had a completely different idea of how the film's score was going to sound. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Both Ludwig GÃ¶ransson & Kendrick Lamar did an exceptional job & created an organic & befitting score.The amount of acting talent brought together for ""Black Panther"" felt uncommonly high for an MCU film, so much so that I almost felt starstrucked. Major acting names such as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya & many more, made their MCU debut & I have to say, they did an absolutely terrific job.Lupita Nyong'o was really good & thankfully her character wasn't reduced to the typical ""love interest"" but instead is shown as a badass warrior & a philanthropist who will always speak her mind no matter what. Of course, the trophy for the most absolute badass character of them all must go to none other than ""Okoye"" (Danai Gurira), the forever-loyal Wakandan general of the ""Dora Milaje"". Let's just say you should never get on her cross-hairs if you know what's good for you. My new favourite MCU supporting character is ""Shuri"" who is brought to life by Letitia Wright. Let us hope she gets a good chunk of screen-time during ""Infinity War"" in order to develop her character because I desperately want to see much more of her. Andy Serkis exudes a level of craziness, almost on a psychopathic level, that has left me in awe of his acting chops, even without the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores.Last but certainly not least, a couple of big names surrounding the film, the protagonist Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) & the antagonist Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Chadwick portrays a Prince trying to step into the shoes of a King & realizing it's a task that hides many dangers & secrets. What more can be said about Chadwick after such a performance other than he has now become the embodiment of Black Panther & it'll be difficult watching him in other roles in the future. A special mention must specifically be made to Michael B. Jordan who has now officially joined the list of actors who have redeemed themselves for previous comic-book movie roles. After 10 years, Michael brings to life the MCU's 1st formidable villain who is completely serious, doesn't joke around, means business & at the same time is a villain the audience can actually relate to. Throughout the film, viewers develop a level of sympathy towards him despite his violent tendencies & can understand where he is coming from, even somewhat justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure. Michael B. Jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film & delivers one of the most (if not the most) powerful & memorable lines in the entirety of the MCU. A phrase that manages to stick with you even several days after viewing the film. Since my reviews tend to be spoiler-free, I'll not be adding it here. Those who have watched the film surely know which one I'm referring to. As for the rest of you, what the hell are you even still doing here? Go watch the film.""Black Panther"" is a contemporary comic-book movie gem, a proof that the age of comic-book movies is not yet over. A further testament that comic-book movies can still produce original, fresh ideas that shelter deep, thought-provoking messages of female empowerment as well as racial & people of color recognition, appreciation & representation while at the same time challenging some misguided sociopolitical norms that are bleeding our planet & its inhabitants.(Updated from 15/02/2018)"
"734",2.5,"  Black Panther is a deathly serious superhero movie that attempts light-hearted comedic moments and fails entirely. As far a marvel films go it is incredibly average in terms of action. Compared to other recent marvel movies, the social references we're out of control, especially with a what are those reference, and it falls flat comedically and breaks the serious tone the movie sets about delicate social issues. The movie tries very hard to add real world social issues into a fictional universe, somewhat succeeds but ultimately falls a little flat in terms of actual solutions to those problems (the social issues can play into the fictional world but the solutions can't come from the fictional world to the real one). Some positives, Jack Kirby was given credit for the character in the credits. The CGI to me almost looked dated and out of place for a marvel movie, especially in 2018, with some scenes reminding me of early 2000s animation. The music in the film was interesting, most if the kendric Lamar songs did not the moment it was used, but was there just to create links to our world in order to trick the viewer into making real world comparisons, which is interesting. Some of the accents in the film we're closer to fake African accents, seeing as most of the actors don't carry the African accent in their daily lives. Overall, Black Panther is an alright film that certainly did not deserve the praise it received from critics and is ultimately going to be remembered not as a cultural milestone, but the 20th or so movie before Infinity War. Not as exciting as Captain America Winter Soldier, but not as boring as Thor: Dark World as far as action goes. Overall okay film, very average but enjoyable for fans of superhero movies and the MCU."
"735",5,"  Seen it! Loved it! X 3!"
"736",3,"  7/10, totally worth going, enjoyed the movie overallpros:BP actor is awesomeKillmonger is awesomeAndy Circus as Claw is awesomeLove the new suitForest whitaker was awesomesolid cast, first time marvel director did a good job especially considering how culturey important and sensitive it was for a moviecons:fights scenes were shot waaaaay to tight in. It was as bad alla bourne identity movie ala shakey cam(edited)waaaaaaaaaaaay to much CGit was actually pretty bad at times and cheesy.General lady overacted and was downright bad. I was hoping she would dieBP sister was anoying as emma, I also hoped she would have diedDaniel Kaluuya was aweful. I understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place.martin freeman wasn't bad but he was terribly forgettableangela basset was under used. she was one of the few actors like forest whitaker who could actually act.last thoughts:overall good movie, would recommend people to see it. I actually liked it more than thor ragnarok. sadly though I will forget about this movie once infinity wars comes out.OH i forgot I liked Lupita Nyong'o, she was good."
"737",2,"  At this point, I don't know if Marvel/Disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive. This film (like Aladdin) made me question my reality in the sense that it presented so many stereotypical, cultural subtleties that I became paranoid of my perspective of culture as a whole. This is probably the most positive thing about the movie. That and Andy Serkis 'hamming' up the script.Like most reviewers, I found the pacing off at times. When I thought there was going to be some plot development in the 'club', oh oh no. The flimmakers probably decided to cut to action pretty quick so they did not have to make a compelling character.Marvel studios (once again) succeeds at dazzling the audience with beautiful people and great visuals to make you forget they are peddling garbage at the cinema."
"738",2,"  I too was persuaded by the hype for this film and was disappointed. A run of the mill Marvel action film which has made a political impact. Michael B. Jordan is its standout star."
"739",1,"  A very boring cinema experiance... Boring Music, boring main character, boring story, boring animations everywhere. For me, this movie is very overrated! And dont forget the ghosting effects, and the dark picture ... yeah 3D ... thank god I havent paid for it!"
"740",1.5,"  ??????, ??? ????? ??????????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ??? ????????? ??????. ??? ?? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ? ???? ?? ????? ????. ???? ?? ??????? ????? ?????, ??? ??????? ?????-??????, ???????, ?????????, ???????, ?? ???? ???, ??? ????????? ?? ???????????? ????????."
"741",4,"  The pace was a bit too slow for me, but it was great from every other aspect."
"742",5,"  This is an amazing movie, it did everything right: Story was spot on, Villain was 3 dimensional, and the concept was executed perfectly. Beyond all that, what set this movie apart is that it focused on topical issues without being bogged down by them: Black identity, racism, immigration/refugee, militarism, and so on. It's more serious than most Marvel movies, but still retain the unique humor that people like. I honestly feel like this is Marvel's answer to Batman franchise of DC. Black Panther should be the hero of gritty social commentary, like Batman is the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order."
"743",4.5,"  Plot: The film starts out, as most franchise starting films do, with a lot of exposition. The first third of the movie is world building. Establishing Wakanda, what Vibranium is, introducing characters essential to the plot. While world building can sometimes be tedious to sit through, you don't really have that with this film. The pacing is quicker than you normally see for this kind of world building but not to the point that it loses the audience or leaves them confused. The only flaw I can see in this part is that the origin of Vibranium is explained, but they don't really take the time to explain how the Vibranium based technology utilizes it. This, combined with overusing the Vibranium as a plot point at times, makes it feel like it's just a way for them to use magic and call it science. Probably could have been helped a bit with a throwaway line with some scientific mumbo jumbo.The second act of the film is where the meat of the story begins. The main conflict of the film is set up, the backgrounds of the antagonists are set up. This part is also paced extremely well. There's zero lag here, everything has a purpose, and the action sequences are well done. It almost has the feel of a James Bond film, right down to the cool gadgets (and Q-esque character introducing the gadgets), spies, car chases, and double-crosses. This is far and away the strongest portion of the film.The third act resolves the conflict. This is also really well executed, if a bit predictable. Stellar action sequences that would make Star Wars proud and all of the important story points tie up neatly (if a bit too neatly).Characters: The characters in the film are wonderfully written and well acted, particularly the secondary characters. If there's a flaw in the writing of the characters, it's that the secondary characters are so good that they make T'Challa seem a bit bland by comparison. But it works really well, especially in the portion of the movie where T'Challa is off screen for a while and they're expected to carry the story (and do it extraordinarily well). The villain is likable without sacrificing his ability to be threatening. He's complex in ways that you don't normally see from super hero movie villains (Loki being the notable exception). The secondary protagonists are extremely strong characters to the point that it takes some work to make you believe that they're in danger (which the film still manages to pull off) and when they are in danger, you're invested and care about them as much as you care about T'Challa, if not more. It's also refreshing to see strong female protagonists. When we see female characters as secondary protagonists in films, they're usually a damsel in distress plot-point, to be captured by the villain and saved by the male protagonist, or are little more than window dressing. These women are having none of that nonsense and the film is better for it.Effects and Cinematography: The film is beautiful. There's no other way to say it. From perfectly shot action sequences that immerse you in the moment to landscapes and sunsets. Everything captures your eye, nothing looks out of place, the effects are fantastic and never take you out of the immersive experience of the film, as can happen with a bad effect (I'm looking at you, Indominous Rex).Summary: It's a great film. There are a few things that could have been done better (Vibranium=Magic, predictable conclusion, and T'Challa being about the 5th most interesting character), but it's an immersive experience, well written, well acted, a strong underlying message that isn't heavy-handed, and a good set up for future films in the franchise."
"744",3,"  Cultural significance of the film overshadows a predictable and underwhelming work."
"745",5,"  Hard to describe the movie in a short review. This movie has layers of details, authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie."
"746",4.5,"  One of the greatest jewels in Marvel's crown. Personal favorite since Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 1."
"747",3.5,"  Like a good portion of the past few Marvel solo outings, Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" could have been a great film, but it also just so happens to do at least a pretty good job at all of the aspects I was looking forward to upon walking into it. The action and effects are mostly effective. The world and tech are undeniably cool. The protagonist and antagonist are both supremely well-developed. But where a lot of the other recent Marvel solo outings fell short, this one does as well. The plot is at times questionably paced and not entirely well-thought-out. Some stylistic choices here and there either sucked me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way. And the humor, while definitely more toned down in this than in other recent solo flicks, also became grating over time. Still, ""Black Panther"" is not a bad film. Maybe close to great, even. But it's also yet another solo Marvel film that's left me with the same conclusion - the team-up's are still the most to me entertaining as of late."
"748",0.5,"  Let's face it, it's a terrible movie. Plot is stupid (what's the point of the whole first act with the south african arm's dealer?), CGI is cheap and ridiculous. Really BAD BAD movie. Seems like people only ""like"" it because it has a black casting. Sad times we live in...."
"749",0.5,"  Warning!!! Spoilers ahead!OMG... Simply awful. Such a mish-mash of dumb ideas, stunted dialog, and horrible storytelling, I simply cannot believe they green lighted this script.My first problem, beyond the stunted dialogue, is how a ""King"" can possibly be in charge of one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world? Need I bring up the whole system of kingly succession where the king has to fight to be ruler??? No, really... That's the system of government... Kick the old kings ass and you get to be the Black Panther!!! It seriously sounds like something out of Monty Python and the Holy Grail: ""Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government""Second problem: Can someone explain why Claw, with the fake arm, was even necessary in this film? Why was the heist in the museum even central to the plot???Third problem: During the end scene, while the CIA agent was shooting down the transport aircraft, the only thing I was thinking of was, 'The poor pilots!' Yah, that's right! He shot the damn transports down and killed the pilots of the aircraft without giving them a chance to surrender or anything! WTF???Forth problem: There was such a mish mash of African cultures from all over the continent wrapped up into one small little invisible country all I could think of was, 'This must be how Walt Disney saw Africa...' Its seriously the equivalent of trying to depict North Americans by having some wear T-shirts, shorts, and saying ""ya'll,"", others waring suits and ties and talking about money, and mish mashing them all together in the same scene. It's not only insulting to African cultures, it's completely too dumb to make sense and shows a lack of vision from their art department...Fifth problem: The dialogue... OMG THE HORRIBLE DIOLOGUE!!! The only characters in this film that had good dialogue at all were the female characters! The male characters were so clichéd and stunted, I seriously couldn't believe this movie wasn't released directly to DVD... In all, this was nothing more than an overpriced B movie without the B movie charm...ZERO!!! Stars! Avoid and wait for it on HBO or Netflix..."
"750",5,"  Awesome movie. tight acting, good riveting action."
"751",5,"  Very interesting, entertaining , Political Correct (it's very important nowadays) and very emotional movie which make me cry everytime I watch it (truth)"
"752",5,"  Favorite super hero movie"
"753",3.5,"  I found the movie entertaining but by no means a a 5 star movie. It may be the dearth of Black Genre movies like Shaft and Django has left a hole needing a movie.Very over-rated."
"754",3.5,"  Thrilling and fun but there weren't any surprises to be had."
"755",0.5,"  Rubbish film promoting ideas that are popular with the alt-right. Avoid."
"756",4,"  I really liked this movie. I thought it was well structured, I was invested in the characters and it was just a fun movie overall. Killmonger's characterization was fantastically diabolic and I thought Michael B. Jordan did a fantastic job playing him. I also liked And Serkis playing Klaw again. Wakanda was a fascinating world to see come to life. It wasn't my favorite Marvel movie, but it was really good."
"757",3,"  A good time no alcohol required"
"758",1,"  I did not like this film!! DISNEY/MARVEL Hype and propaganda! Typical MARVEL MOVIE!"
"759",5,"  I love the change of pace, the shift of focus and all of the acting. The villain has great motivation and I love how it influences the conclusions the main character reaches, but it's not his acting that stands out to me, but the acting of most everybody else. T'Challa is awesome, his sister and love interest are awesome, and I absolutely love the internal debates of duty vs emotion."
"760",4,"  Similar to Ant Man with strong characters, cast, and moving story line. Could have trimmed about 20 minutes off the middle where there was too much dialog that could have been summed up in a few lines so get your popcorn then and watch the last 45 minutes of action."
"761",5,"  Fun and awesome to watch! Best Marvel antagonist yet"
"762",4,"  Sure, it's another Marvel cookie-cutter, but Black Panther's world building, visuals and villainous threat still makes it watchable."
"763",1.5,"  Can Marvel be boring? Yup -Black Panther is a Snooze to be a MCU entry."
"764",5,"  Amazing film! Watching it again and again!"
"765",4.5,"  Throgoughly enjoyed the movie."
"766",5,"  Thought provoking, beautifully shot and well acted. My expectations were blown away. Amazing , simply amazing !!????????????????"
"767",5,"  I've seen this move 6 times already. One of the best Marvil films."
"768",5,"  The King has Arrived!!!"
"769",5,"  I had high expectations and was still blown out of the water. Cannot recommend this movie enough."
"770",2.5,"  Just another marvel movie. Average or a little above average.Bad cgi at moments, acceptable cinematography."
"771",3.5,"  Black Panther 3.5/5 Stars. A solid addition to the Marvel universe, Panther is a bar-raising film in some ways, and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others. -Things they got right:It cannot be denied that this is a culturally important picture, with an almost all African American cast in a setting that is not U.S. slavery era or Malcolm X. The cast was awesome, especially the 3 female leads who mostly held this story together. Lititia Wright as Shuri steals every scene she is in. Danai Gurira , Lupita Nyong'o and Chadwick Boseman are all very charismatic and fun to watch. The art department for Black Panther deserves high praise. The costumes and gadgetry are eye popping. Character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes, and i really liked some of the supporting roles. -Things they got wrong:Where did the cool music from the trailer go? i guess it got cut. Otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place.Like the Soundtrack- i felt like the movie couldnt decide what it wanted to be. Are we trying to feel grounded in reality, are we diving into the crazy end of the pool like Ragnarok? Are we trying to be a solemn culturally aware film with an overall positive message or are we making bad jokes relating to memes that noone will remember in 10 years?Most of the CGI looked good, but sometimes it was used inexplicably, like they were trying to get away with shooting something that was supposed to be outside but couldnt make it happen. The story was not strong as far as the steps executed. i felt Disney's hand in some of this. Don't tell me you don't see Lion King all over this, i couldnt help it. i don't think they risked enough to differentiate the plot from dozens of other hero's journeys and it's a shame because Black Panther's history is interesting. So, overall solid, but not a standout. Better than what many franchises are doing these days but probably middle of the pack for me as far as the Marvel Universe is concerned."
"772",4.5,"  Along with Thor Ragnarok, I think this film is ushering in a new age of Marvel movies that can balance all the things that makes Marvel great in equal measure. It has the imagination and humor of films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man, as well as the emotion and moral dilemmas of films like Captain America Winter Soldier and Avengers:Age of Ultron. The characters are interesting and complex, the action scenes are amazing, the storyline is engaging, and I could write a whole novel on how gorgeous this movie is. The costumes, the scenery, the lighting, I could watch this movie without sound and still be completely enthralled. I see this being one of the films I can see over and over again without ever getting bored."
"773",5,"  Lol the only ones who hated the movie we're Nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks. As some one whose not a Klan member criticizing the film all I can say is WAKANDA

"774",5,"  An excellent film! History, dynamics, drama, battle scenes are all at the highest level."
"775",2.5,"  Rather slow. Weak and forgetabble action sequence/choreography. Actions at almost first half not well lit. The suit cgi looks more like magic rather than tech like what it supposed to be. And the final battle cgi when they both are falling and fighting are quite video-gamey. Interesting speech at the end of the movie thou. So all in all is rather overhyped."
"776",4.5,"  87/100""Black Panther"" dirigida estupendamente por Ryan Coogler sorprende gratamente a la hora de ofrecer no solo un esplÃ©ndido entretenimiento, sino una pelÃ­cula lo suficientemente inspirada y con personalidad, que sabe lo que quiere ser y que consigue ser (casi del todo) Ãºnica; y eso se debe gracias al guion de Coogler y Joe Robert Cole quienes se empeÃ±an por darle una voz propia tanto a los personajes como al lugar donde transcurre gran parte de la historia (Wakanda es increÃ­ble y aborda con mucho acierto temas sociales y polÃ­ticos) que se beneficia del magnÃ­fico talento de sus actores (Chadwick Boseman como T'Challa consigue engancharnos al ver sus primeros pasos como monarca y Michael B. Jordan dota de gran autenticidad emocional a su villano; Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o y Leticia Wright ponen la guinda del pastel con sus bien perfilados personajes femeninos, tanto que llegan a opacar el tambiÃ©n buen hacer de Andy Serkis como Klaw, Forrest Whitaker como Zuri y Martin Freeman como Ross), de la espectacular banda sonora y de una hermosa fotografÃ­a, aun cuando su acabado visual no termine de estar a la altura del film (hay algunos momentos donde no termina de convencer)."
"777",3.5,"  Lots of fun, great characters, another solid Marvel movie."
"778",4.5,"  Strengths: Director Ryan Coogler had a lot of faith put in him to helm this movie after only directing two prior films. And yet, he does a fantastic job with it. He nails the action sequences and the big set pieces in a way you'd expect from a more seasoned director of this genre. They did a fantastic job of making Wakanda look breathtaking. It is a wonderful place and has me excited that it will be a partial setting for Infinity War. Cinematographer Rachel Morrison made sure Wakanda was impressive. It was more visually stunning than more famous utopias like Avatar. Moving into the performances, everyone delivers. Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) is a great lead, bringing a coolness and vulnerability to the role that was needed. However, the show stealer is easily Michael B. Jordan (N'Jadaka/Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens). The best villains are the ones who have a good claim to actually being right in what they're doing and you could easily sympathize with this character. Every single time he's on screen, you're captivated. It's incredible to watch, especially if you (like me) have been a fan of Jordan since his early work. The other supporting actors are all great. The standouts are the surprising Sterling K. Brown (N'Jobu) in a small, but poignant role, Letitia Wright (Shuri), and Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia). Seriously though, they're all great. Not only that, but even the lesser characters get fully developed arcs and are well-rounded. Throw in a tremendous soundtrack and you've got a winner. Weaknesses: My biggest gripe with the film came from the character W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya). Daniel did fine in the role, but his character arc felt kind of rushed. I understand the motivation behind it, but he goes from our protagonist's best friend, to turning on him too quickly. He ends up feeling more like a nuisance than anything. Also, because Jordan was so great as the villain, I do think a bit too much time might've been spent on Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue). Granted, Serkis was good, but not getting much of Jordan for the first portion of the movie left me wanting more. These are minor qualms, though. Overall: There was so much hype surrounding this film and they managed to live up to, and surpass, most of it. The performances, set pieces, direction, action scenes, and soundtrack were all stellar. This is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie that we needed at the right time. One of the best MCU films ever, which is saying something."
"779",5,"  Absolutely awesome. Will be seeing it again!"
"780",4.5,"  This movie was a lot of fun, with a great story. The characters were all well developed and were casted perfectly. Graphics were good, but not the best i've seen in a Marvel movie. Still highly recommended"
"781",5,"  easily the best movie in the entire world no question"
"782",5,"  This movie was amazing, revolutionary, and I hope to see more afrofuturism in cinema very soon."
"783",2.5,"  Average superhero movie. Worth a rental."
"784",5,"  I will admit given the current political climate and what people had been saying, and not being a fan of the main actor ( I tend to find him stiff and borish ). I even heard it was the best MCU movie BEFORE it was released ( Overhype before release usually bad sign, RE: The current Star Wars Movies, anything with Rhianna in it ) so I had real low expectations. I was sorely mistaken, I wouldn't and won't say it was THE BEST MCU movie EVER.. ( like others ), but it was well written, well acted. Yes, its a mainly Black cast, Black actor, etc.. But thats neither the focal point, nor in anyway something you ""think about"". In the same way The Walking Dead is not about Zombies and you forget about the Zombies as you get engrossed by the story and the acting, the same is true of Black Panther. The story is set in Africa, so yes the characters are African, and the country is African, and the story line revolves around this African country. They happen to be black, because they are African thats it. There are social elements injected into the story line but not in what you would expect. Is this the BEST Superhero or MCU movie.. ? No, thats simply hyperbolic, Is it some blacksplotation MCU movie railing ""Against the man"", Nope not that BS either. What it is is a great Superhero movie, and in my top 2. Behind Dr Strange. Becuase that movie set the bar... Overall great movie, great writing, and goes without saying great visuals"
"785",1,"  just a bad movie : )"
"786",4.5,"  While not a flawless film, Ryan Coogler's take on the MCU proves to be one of their best films. Including one of their most fascinating stories, fully realized characters, stunning action, and great performances from Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and a standout, yet charismatic turn from Michael B. Jordan."
"787",1,"  I was amazed when I saw that the Gimp from Pulp Fiction got his own movie, but it was a big disappointment when I found out that it's just another one of these vapid Disney Marvel movies. Just your standard, inane Marvel fare, skip it and watch it on a Sunday morning when you're fighting off a hangover and you need to turn off your brain for 2 hours."
"788",0.5,"  Richard Spencer (the alt-right guy behind the whole Charlottesville thing) loves it for it's portrayal ethnonationalism and so do the critics. The alt-right and the people who love this movie want the same thing. Pathetic."
"789",3.5,"  Good mid range Marvel movie. Spent a bunch of time on the 'wonders of Wakanda', but otherwise did a good job with character development -esp supporting characters. Marvel tends to do a better job than DC on this stuff vs DC 'stuff blows up real good'.There is a bit of 'slight whitey', but whatever. It isn't like there aren't movies in the past that went the other way. More like blacks trying to decide their role in the world, which is what drives the plot conflict."
"790",5,"  If you don't go see this movie your gonna regret it"
"791",0.5,"  This movie is overrated as fuck. The CGI looks like ass and most of the dialogue is inconsequential to the story. I thought the mish-mash of African cultures was distracting (I can only assume some white studio executive approved it all without knowing much about the cultures themselves), and the vibranium was a plot device with no limitations that just made the main characters immortal, therefore all the fight scenes had no real stakes, and fixed all the other problems in Wakanda. The movie failed at being a good superhero movie, because there weren't enough fight scenes and the one ones we got we mostly CGIfests that weren't that interesting, and it didn't work as a political drama either because the forces superhero themes distracted from a political and emotional connection, and the ideas of racial injustice were watered down. It didn't help that it was all implied either; there is no scene detailing the racial tension anywhere in the movie, which could have added some more compelling narrative as opposed trying to establish T'Challa as ruler or whatever (which took way too much time in the movie). I would have liked to see Kilmonger's story expanded because he was the only good part of the movie. His backstory and personality were interesting but underdeveloped. I think it would be really fun to see him succeed and get the vibranium weapons out of WakandaThis movie had a lot to improve on. It wasn't terrible but all of you fanboys piss me off because this movie isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. ""It's representation of black people in mainstream culture that we haven't seen before""I'll give you that, this is an important cultural moment. I hope we get more black and minority representation in movies because of the success of this movie. But I also hope in the future those movies aren't super boring"
"792",2.5,"  another dull marvel movie. If you enjoyed the other mcu films you will probably enjoy this. Its mostly free of the terrible disney humor and has a good setting. Not much here if you're already tired of these films. pretty average"
"793",1.5,"  Some cool looking scenes and unique ideas but the plot line was totally illogical, cgi was terribly lazy in areas, and all in all the movie just did not make sense in the slightest."
"794",4,"  Marvelously realized, an heir to the throne must not only fend for his people, but right the wrongs of his legacy. A taught, fresh action fantasy that kicks down doors in all the right ways. *If you liked: Rogue One, The Hunger Games, The Force Awakens, Game of Thrones."
"795",5,"  So great to see one of my three most favorite Avengers on the big screen, along with Thor and Captain America. Film is pretty much a standalone MCU movie, which is fine, but they do give a great background story for the history of Wakanda. Boseman as the Black Panther was outstanding, gives off the regal vibe the character should have. Loved all of the action scenes, and I didn't think too much was given away in the trailers, except for the Seoul car chase. The villains were outstanding, between Klaue and Killmonger. Serkis and Jordan delivered wonderful performances."
"796",4.5,"  Culturally significant comic book cinema that looks fantastic and is loaded with lots of great characters. While the movie has many strong females in the plot and a dignified moral leading man , the story is up-staged by the lovely presence of Michael B Jordan as the villain. you can't take your eyes off the dude...."
"797",5,"  I saw it. I loved it. The layers of themes happening in the movie -- revenge, identity, defending the crown, embracing female leaders and strengths, AND a majority Black cast! This is the first time I've left a movie feeling so invigorated and good about myself. I was able to identify with so many of the characters and situations. And the fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I'm going to see it again."
"798",1.5,"  I am actually surprised I hated this movie! Typical, nothing new, same ole story, type casted .....=gag!"
"799",4.5,"  A very exciting superhero movie with interesting political ramifications and surprisingly robust character development."
"800",4,"  It took 10 years and 18 movies, but the MCU finally found a great villain with complex motivations in Erik Killmonger. The rest of the movie is an entertaining pop melodrama, and one that really feels like a comic book."
"801",4,"  Visually-stunning and topped-off with stellar performances all around and incredible action sequences, Black Panther in some ways lives up to the hype. The story, however, could've been tied together a bit more. Definitely NOT a 97%, however."
"802",1.5,"  Just another mediocre marvel movie. CG a B- at best. A string cast, but not enough to save the movie. A story line that in this day and age should be being questioned and or considered the antithesis of what so called progressive minded people want. Yet the media spin machine is making millions for the folks behind marvel universe."
"803",5,"  Really great movie with some ethnic and modern mix culture"
"804",0.5,"  Disappointing. This movie showed so much promise but acting, the soundtrack and even CGI were subpar. So upset!"
"805",4.5,"  I had a few issues with some of the seemingly rushed or exagerrated character motivations (most notably Wakabi and Killmonger, the latter of whom's rage really borders on unbelievable and psychotic, despite his ability to successfully pull off a major coup) but other than that, Black Panther is a FANTASTIC epic of royal blood, kings, and kingdoms, that successfully updates the Hamlet narrative in a way that pushes the boundary of Hollywood gatekeeping and provides a truly entertaining spectacle."
"806",4,"  This is not a great movie, but it is hilariously entertaining. Not so much the Black Panther himself (he's boring with his daddy issues) but the supporting cast. Letitia Wright's witty sister, Martin Freeman's Caucasian comic relief, and, most of all, Michael B. Jordan's Angry Black Man from Hell villain with his jarring, slang-filled American accent (his final words must surely win the Unintentional Humor of the Year Award)."
"807",5,"  Fantastic film! Hands down one of the MCU's best, I honestly dislike almost half of the mcu films but this movie is phenomenal and recommend it to everyone!"
"808",4,"  This is a very good superhero movie. The performance were excellent. But a lot of details lacked explanation, and resolution. If Wakanda is a hidden peaceful wonderland in the middle of Africa, why do they still have warring tribes? Sounds like they haven't evolved beyond the outside world from which they're hiding. And if Killmonger is the product of a Wakandan and a white worman how did his ancestors throw themselves into the sea from slave ships? Was his mom raised on a white-slave ship? They don't explain how vibranium can apparently do EVERYTHING, which is OK, but smart (ass) guy Stark should have ALSO figured that out, since Captain America's shield is made from the same stuff. DEADPOOL: still the best superhero film, since it refuses to take itself seriously."
"809",4,"  A tier 2 Marvel character that ended up delivering a tier 1 movie!!Hard to find fault with this flick. Great acting with bold characters. Good story line that followed safe but entertaining pacing. The only misstep would be the almost Ikea type innovation lab. Powerful technology and yet, it was all presented on a fold away table with a hint of teen bedroom on a budget - surely a culture that could produce a stunning technological masterpiece as the holographic cockpit could afford better lab furniture.But, that goes to show how well polished the rest of the movie was where an apparent mis-step on set design was all that irked. Every character felt meaningful. The baddie and good guy interaction never strayed too far into comic book blah - they had emotions that were believable and transient beyond their role. And as for the supporting cast - you know it is good when they never felt like they were there to be bit parts. They became characters worth watching in their own right.The whole ensemble of characters jumped out of the screen with such clarity and visceral realism that even in 2d, you felt whole absorbed into their world. Roll on BP2!!"
"810",5,"  Wow. Fantastic costuming, excellent dialogue, powerful supporting characters, amazing portrayals, cool special effects. There was not a single bad moment in this movie. I'm not really an action flick fan, normally, but I've been loving some of the superhero movies and this one is, breadth-wise, the best yet. I had only one jarring moment, and that was the music used when T'Challa meets his father at the Panther tree (for lack of a better nonspoilery description) the first time. I'll probably see this in the theater twice, and I hardly ever see movies more than once on the big screen. Even the minor characters were awesome, and the sweeping shifts in locale were well done. A new classic."
"811",4,"  Fun film overall. I would've liked to see more of T'challa with his father. Killmonger was the best part of the film."
"812",2.5,"  The Preview for the movie didn't grab me and I went into this movie with the same expectation as Ant Man. The difference was that Ant Man actually surprised me and was a fun movie to watch. Black Panther felt more like a political statement and after about an hour into the movie I was checking my watch. It really didn't lead up to Infinity Wars at all, which I think was strange since that is the next movie to be released. I am a huge Marvel Avengers series fan and own all the movies. Winter Soldier, Thor Rag, Avengers, Civil War, Guardians 1 are at the top of my list, but this might be the first Avenger series movie I don't buy."
"813",5,"  Awesome Movie. Only thing i wanted was more fighting from Black Panther like on Civil War"
"814",0.5,"  WTF.... horrible from the opening scene! What are people talking about? I have zero interest populist social commentary when choosing a super hero movie. They really jam it down your throat! Annoying at best. The Kendrick Lamar soundtrack was great though!"
"815",5,"  Excellent special effects. The story was Shakespearian. Characters well developed."
"816",1,"  Bunch of racist crap packed into a movie that shouldn't even be half as long as it is."
"817",1,"  It's bad, why is it so hyped?The bad: Script, writing is bad, it's poor and disjointed, stories are boring and don't make you root for the kingMain actor: it's poor version of Nicholas Cage, no emotions, honestly.. at some point I didn't care if he dies..The Good:GCI - unbelievable, it's Avatar-like, the scenery is amazing!Secondary actors: Brilliant! the General, sister and Ape king made the movie bearable.. Overall: Really bad movie.. the Black Panther idea is really good (mix of superpower and technology) but the story and poor acting broke it.. Wait for it on Redbox, it's not worth more than a dollar"
"818",1,"  Gee, not a single rotten tomato by the professional critic's guild. What a surprise."
"819",1,"  Kiddish Avatar-alike...Not worth"
"820",2,"  I wasn't crazy about the movie."
"821",2,"  Saw this and wasn't impressed at all."
"822",1,"  Not a good movie-- comic book movies belong in comic books. The movie completely lacked diversity."
"823",1,"  The acting was terribly distracting, I recommend for those who are into action ,the special effects was enjoyable"
"824",2,"  Weak first 30 minutes. Never really rises to the stanard"
"825",1,"  Finally a movie that wanted to make itself the worst Marvel movie. This was awful."
"826",2,"  Overrated. Too political!"
"827",1,"  Boring...reminded me of the SW prequels."
"828",1,"  The first third of the movie is very good and compelling. It then becomes increasingly boring with very little investment in any further character development or nuance. There is almost no super hero action and the character arcs all seem built upon making sure each character gets their big triumphant moment without enough investment to make it meaningful when they do so. There is very little black panther in this black panther movie and our hero loses almost every fight he is in only winning by sheer luck at the last second in most. Overall this is a sub par superhero movie with some good moments and a nice political narrative that carries the film in spite of all its other flaws. In the end it is boring however and the final ""epic battle"" is lame and without tension."
"829",2,"  I thought it was boring and I love Marvel and DC films."
"830",1,"  perfect effects. great costumesgreat soundterrible story! really, come on... i actually didn't care who's gonna die, the good guy or the bad guy.just wanted this ridicules story to end....maybe the worst movie EVER of marvel.too bad."
"831",4,"  You guys are so racist towards this movie. You are probably just a bunch of DC fan boys trying to dump some s**t towards Marvel because they are winning."
"832",2,"  TO be honest, visually impressive but the entire story was shallow and boring. Came close to walking out midway through because the whole storyline was so telegraphed that you could pick the ending a mile out."
"833",2,"  Boring. I don't understand why this movie is getting such high ratings. As far as I'm concerned it was a waste of a Saturday afternoon, not to mention $50"
"834",2,"  Overrated and hyped up too much."
"835",1,"  Huge hype equals huge letdown with this boring film. It is by far one of the worst MCU movies to date with a mind numbing plot, poor acting, bad cgi, meh action scenes, and forced humor. Sure, there are spots were the film works for a few minutes, but as a whole, Black Panther just isn't very good. Really can't understand how so many critics love this one and how anyone would give this 10 stars. My advice is wait for the digital/dvd release and save your money."
"836",1,"  Apparently the pleases the critics. Rating it so low to bring other peoples expectations down, its by no ways a bad movie its just disgustingly over hyped."
"837",1,"  seriously absolute crap, so cheesy, no storyline worth mentioning, they go against what they say they want to acomplish, crap"
"838",1,"  Why oh why for the love of all that is HOLY do we have to endure a 90 minute orgy of CGI with only like 30 minutes of story? Marvel is consistently guilty of this. I super appreciate the ""Origin Story"" but would love to see more ""STORY"" and less CGI nonsense. SIDE NOTE: Michael B. Jordan needs to be in more stuff. Loved him in The Wire and thought he did really great in Creed."
"839",1,"  Too much politics in the movie. If I wanted politics, I would turn on the news."
"840",2,"  I can't believe I spent 20 dollars and 2 hours + to watch such a terrible movie, while on the internet I can find ZERO negative reviews."
"841",5,"  Black Panther!!!!!!!"
"842",1,"  Predictable story, paper thin characters, pointless violence, I just got bored and ended up walking out half way through."
"843",1,"  Worst Averagers movie"
"844",1,"  I bought into the hype and saw Black Panther tonight. Based on the Rotten Tomatoes scores, this should have been the best movie of the year and one of the greats.I must not have drunk the right Kool-aid. This may have been the worst movie I've seen in years. It's got action and special effects but the rest is awful: The plot barely hangs together. It's hard to care about characters that are so weakly written. The audience walked out of the movie confused and low energy.You may win Political Correctness points for seeing and pretending to like this movie, but honestly, this emperor has no clothes."
"845",1,"  Not very good after all the hype. Sad to see most of the positive ratings are by people who have not seen it yet. This is misleading. Watch it then rate it."
"846",0.5,"  Looking at the Critic Reviews, I can't help but think how pathetic Hollywood is. 100%? Really? This movie was perfect? I love the virtue signaling bs. I'm won't watch it just because of the political nonsense. Let me know when we start making movies again."
"847",0.5,"  another stupid marvel movie. they are all the same why waste money and time"
"848",1,"  Overrated. I don't recommend. Possibly on the bottom of Marvel movies."
"849",3.5,"  As a Disney investor, I really want this movie to be good, but movies are getting so politically charged and partisan, Im afraid its going to be another 'Last Jedi fiasco' full of Hollywood self righteousness and preachiness. I pray its not going to preach to me. Most poeple today dont care about a persons skin color, race, ethnicity, etc. Really we dont. Just be a decent human being please and stop 'white-splaining' us to death. A message is not what makes movies great, its the acting, the production and a story that can stand on its own. I cant trust the critics anymore."
"850",4.5,"  I am very excited for this one! I like the trailers so far, and I love the costuming and the cast!"
"851",1,"  It's a decent movie,but the hyped killed it"
"852",1,"  After like 1/2 hour, the story becomes lame. No more surprises or twist after the reveal of MB Jordan back-story. Its too predictable & lame from that point. Action scenes almost until the last battle were all already shown us in trailers & thats all.Not hated it but it isn't a Marvel's entertaining & humorous style movie by any means. Felt like watching a classic bollywood movie."
"853",1,"  Really? Terrible. Nearly the worst Marvel film ever."
"854",0.5,"  No thanks. It wasn't very good."
"855",1,"  Muy mala. Hace mucho que no tenía tantas ganas de levantarme del cine (porque ademÃ¡s de mala es muy larga al pedo)"
"856",1,"  boring, cheesy low-rent effects, crap fight scenes, fake fake fake stupid worst show of the year, shoulda gone straight to video. Ratings propped up by trolls to fit a political agenda for a bunch of losers."
"857",1,"  truly awesomely AWFUL"
"858",1,"  Very disappointing it lacked a lot of element that a marvel movie has a complete waste of time that only thing good about this movie is the snacks I was eating"
"859",2,"  first time it was amazing but now its just getting old"
"860",1,"  The CGI in almost whole movie look ridiclious Didn't looked real at all and it semmed peculiar about the villan and the overall story and triend to wrap it in an nutshell it wasnt up to the mark but it was a still good effort"
"861",2,"  Can you just make a movie and stop adding in all your propaganda? Visually, the movie was stunning! Story was okay. Not really impressed."
"862",3,"  i guess I was expecting a better ,different movie because of all the hoopla.....this is typ[cal super hero fare.....bloodless fights,dead people alive again,plot that makes no sense.....I've actually avoided these movies for awhile,just because they're so pointless.....oh well.....what do I know...it'll make a billion dollars i'm sure...."
"863",1,"  I didn't make it past the first act. The action was great, but the redundancy of the second king origin story was unwatchable; they showed the exact same fight scene twice in the first hour (fight to death, with MMA rules). I will try again when its out on streaming."
"864",5,"  CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE"
"865",5,"  Eagerly Waiting for this one!"
"866",1,"  Didnt like it at all"
"867",5,"  this movie is going to be good"
"868",0.5,"  Another mediocre marvel action flick, brainless action like the rest. but theyll call you racist if u dont like it, so reviewers are keen on over-hyping it for ""breaking barriers"" regardless of quality."
"869",1,"  eh, just another generic, by-numbers flick from marvel/disney"
"870",1,"  Where are the user reviews for Black Panther?"
"871",1,"  This is just another super hero movie being overly praised.As a superhero movie, it is nothing we haven't seen before.As a movie, its another horrible mess with tons of plot holes, uninteresting characters with 0 development and mess of a story. Despise of what most ""critics"" say, this movie has not brought us anything new."
"872",1,"  It's basically the same Marvel movie again only with different hero."
"873",5,"  Ticket for Saturday night!"
"874",1,"  overrated. The villain was better than the ""hero"" #KillmongerWasRight"
"875",1,"  Overly hyped movie once again by the critics. Good thing I only paid $5 at the matinee because that's all this movie is worth."
"876",5,"  I'm open because I loved comics. I love the actors also and grew up on Marvel. Racial and political views are in almost every movie you see. You have to learn to choose what you get from movies and form your own opinions, separating biases, and appreciate story telling from the artists who worked hard to present it. I'm hoping for the best and excited to see the effects and CGI. Pass peace and love."
"877",1,"  Utterly over-rated and desperately overhyped for reasons of political-correctness. Identity-politics has rugby-tackled the Marvel genre and won't let go. Oh dear. (Iron Man, all is forgiven)"
"878",5,"  Omg I can't wait marvel forever"
"879",1,"  Another exceptionally boring marvel movie."
"880",4,"  i. want. to see. this. movie."
"881",1,"  i am really getting tired of all the dry & dull humour in these movies & honestly the acting was terrible."
"882",1,"  Average movie at best. Wished it had tied in with the MCU as well as a bit of a hint towards infinity war."
"883",1,"  this movie was a real disappointment to me personally. It let me down and seeing a build up to Infinity Wars and it let me down with an uninteresting plot and storyline. It also failed to entertain or to mesmerise. Even the comic relief wasn't even funny. Kilmore was a poorly developed character that they gave way too much time too. I don't feel like this film had any too much bearing on the Marvel Universe."
"884",1,"  What a disappointment. The movie has about 20 minutes of really interesting action time and the rest is a total bore. Total cliche of a movie that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth."
"885",1,"  Never laughed so hard, this movie is a joke ."
"886",3,"  This movie is going to take the political thriller of winter soldier and civil war to a new level of awesomeness!!! Cant wait!!!"
"887",1,"  More of a stand alone movie than anything addint to the MCU which is my biggest gripe. It makes T'Challa out to be a weak leader and I thought it was very one dimensional.I was expecting a lot more, yes there was SOME political leaning about black people but that didn't bother me. It was more just .... what was the point? That Wakanda will be sharing it's tech with the world now?Definitely dissapointed and the 97% rating from critics is like usual complete and utter crap that is already being dispelled. 77% user rating now and that will likely drop.Critis and Hollywood need to get a grip, the people of the world don't like the tripe they try to command people they like.2.5/5 stars for me, I'll watchg it when it is on HBO again, but it is no Thor or Dr. Strange or Iron Man, I will tell you that.I actually thought Black Panther had a much stronger, better and more fulfilling war in Civil War than he didn in his own moie."
"888",1,"  Too much drama and irrelevant teachings of imaginary African tribes.Barring few visual surprises, this one has absolutely nothing to offer."
"889",1,"  Most underwhelming and overhyped thing I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through."
"890",3,"  Not as fun as I had hoped"
"891",1,"  The WORST marvel movie I've seen. Acting terrible..Story terrible.. If you want to sit through 2 hours of political correctness run amok ... have at it. I think I'm done with the movies.. Hollywood. Look for this to tank next week."
"892",4,"  Pretty good film. For a Marvel film it was great, but I've grown accustomed to a lot of action and though this film had action the pacing in between was a wee bit too slow. Loved the spiritual elements, the geopolitical elements, and the family abandonment and the pain it can cause. Great message, good film."
"893",3,"  I'll see it, but I'm not expecting gold. It seems like it'd be just another forgettable film like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange.I doubt leave a lasting impact to me like the Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, Captain America, Ghost Rider, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil and especially Spider-Man (the superior series with Tobey Maguire, not the shitty ass series with Andrew Garfield) . . ."
"894",1,"  This is a visual spectacle...the CGi parts...but can't, for the life of me, understand the wooden statue performances. There are Oscar nominated actors/actresses (and one winner) in this movie who are saying lines, standing in place, showing nothing. If this is what the director was going for, then success. If not, I can't see the big hullabaloo. The women warriors were outstanding in action sequences---but said little. Michael B. Jackson should have at least been nominated for Fruitvale Station--should have Won an Oscar for Creed, but this is nothing comparatively speaking. When I think of Lupita's scenes in 12 years a Slave, I am still moved---as well as Daniel Kalaayua in Get Out. These performances are nothing next to those mentioned. I don't get it."
"895",1,"  boring, slow and bad acting plus terrible dialogue"
"896",1,"  One really over rated much hyped film, wouldn't waste your time seeing this bag of tripe"
"897",4,"  Don't look at all these 1/2 Star rating. It's a huge group bombing it to ruin the audience score. This was a sold 4 star movie"
"898",1,"  Awful effects, stilted acting and strange back story. I'm so tired of Disney's hype machine for these bad films."
"899",1,"  I saw it and didn't love it. I thought he message was important. But that doesn't mean the movie was good.Great message. Great actors . Horrible movie."
"900",1,"  Boring, and stupid. Does not even seem a Marvel movie"
"901",1,"  Build up is unjustifiable on this very avg movie. Complete waste paying for the theatre experience. Wish I had waited until it hits the bargain bin at Walmart"
"902",0.5,"  too politicized, as a movie, just another marvel thing"
"903",1,"  I don't get the positive reviews. This movie does not meet the hype. The Disney machine must be doing its thing of getting everybody excited about a mediocre movie and calling it the ""best movie of the year""."
"904",3,"  Fairly good movie Hollywood typical"
"905",5,"  I seriously can't wait to see this movie. History in the making."
"906",3,"  the movie was ok. A tad bit overrated if you ask me. but I love the look of the movie and everyone was beautiful. My people mad me proud."
"907",1,"  found to be slightly bland and not to my taste"
"908",1,"  below average boring."
"909",5,"  Got my tickets ready. Can't wait!!"
"910",1,"  Laughably bad, poorly written."
"911",1,"  Just another marvel movie, starting to get sick of them."
"912",1,"  Overrated and childish race bait. 5th worst MCU film"
"913",1,"  Acting is not so great. Storyline confusing and doesn't make sense."
"914",5,"  I have been waiting for a movie like this ever since I watched my first comic book movie over thirty years ago."
"915",5,"  Looking forward to seeing it!"
"916",5,"  Got my tix! Next weekend! Woo hoo!"
"917",1,"  Lol I slept through it, there went $38 for 2 tickets."
"918",1,"  Seen the movie, think real life lion king you'll get the plot. Found it slow, 1 fight repeated 3 tines, think this will drop off steep, after word of mouth. Infinity war please hurry up. Worst mcu movie so far, as bad as phantom menace talking trade federations. Only up point is showing strong women."
"919",1,"  Not 4 me I don't get into movies like this..."
"920",1,"  Meh...wasn't the worst movie"
"921",5,"  BRING ON THE VIBRANIUM WAR!!!"
"922",1,"  Superhero movies are played out."
"923",1,"  Saw the movie. It was OK. It wasn't bad but I found it's Social Justice messages annoying and that really detracted from the movie. I think all the over-the-top reviews are simply based on a desire to see the obvious racially charged movie do well, not on the actual movie itself."
"924",1,"  Nope, not at all interested in this."
"925",1,"  I don't like superhero movies because they are all the same"
"926",1,"  Cool action sequences, plot was a mess and the acting was weak"
"927",5,"  This movie is better than you expected, Marvel keeps cracking these great movie one after another."
"928",1,"  This movie was honest to god the most disappointing and least interesting Marvel movie I have ever seen. I feel this movie could have easily have been more interesting if they just spent more time on it. Black Panther is one of my favorite superheroes and when I watched Civil War I wanted to see more of the MCU version but I feel this movie took the amazing Black Panther from Civil War and made him boring. Also the movie is filled with deaths you don't even care about. *Spoilers* I feel Forest Winikers character was completely wasted. He got like 5 boring minutes of screen time and I feel like we were actually supposed to care about his death meanwhile I didn't. Also I feel the dialogue was a little out of place to. Especially when Forest Winiker was talking to Black Panther about how his dad created Kilmonger. Also I hated the constant switch in language from Wakandan 2 English. It made the movie overall confusing and hard to follow. This movie was overall disappointing and I found BvS more intereseating than this."
"929",0.5,"  horrible CGI, makes justice league look good"
"930",1,"  Ummm, no. Very disappointed. I am not going to applaud this movie because there are a bunch of black people in it. It had a plot that has been done numerous times before...main character: I am king. Antagonist: No you're not, I am King. Antagonist takes throneProtagonist goes through some redemption process and takes back throne.The EndThink Lion King without the talent and crappy dialogue.Enjoy"
"931",1,"  Meh. Just another cookie-cutter superhero film. Not anything novel or interesting enough to make me want to see it twice."
"932",4,"  Solid addition to the MCU. First quarter of the movie was slow but the backstory is necessary. It's not a fun and entertaining as GOTG or Thor Ragnorok but it's a solid movie."
"933",1,"  Interesting but very by the books. No real surprises to grab my attention."
"934",0.5,"  This film looks sad..."
"935",1,"  I did not see the hype in this at all. Felt very little in the way of caring about any of the characters or their decisions. I'm pretty sure the love interest subplot was an after thought cause I forgot about it entirely. Definitely wasn't anything to hoop and holler about, unless you're a fan of the Ape man and his ability to literally steal the show at every opportunity. Did not care for him being used as the only comic relief and the predictability of his actions. Wasn't the worst MCU film, I couldn't say it was worth the ticket prices though. Probably should have just waited for infinity wars."
"936",5,"  I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT WAIT! THE TRAILERS LOOK AMAZZZZIIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!"
"937",1,"  I was so hyped for this movie and it fell flat. The best bits were in the trailer and they switched the bad guys in the middle of the film!! It only got exciting 75% into the film...."
"938",5,"  I saw Black Panther at Atlanta screening. It's the best superhero movie since Captain America Civil War. This one is an absolute must see. Everyone will love this movie. No question it will have a well deserved special meaning for anyone with African roots. I have never heard so much applause during the entire course of a movie. This one will have legs at the box office. I would put good money on this one breaking a billion worldwide."
"939",5,"  I am thrilled and excited about this film for a variety reasons. As a woman, a mother, a person of color and child of the 80's who loves comics and super heroes, it means so very much. For me, it goes beyond the entertainment, the action and the fandom. It's the representation on the big screen that makes it so thrilling. When I was young, being a dark skinned black girl was treated like a crime. I was picked on, laughed at and called names because of my skin tone. But now, the amazing dark-skinned women in this film are revered, respected and seen as beautiful, awesome, kick-ass heroines. Coming full circle does not even begin to describe it. I can't wait to see it."
"940",1,"  Many of the fresh tomato critics summed it up too well for me to compete. I'm glad that even with Disneys immoral pressure for them to rate it fresh they still list it as ""2/5,"" or say their true feelings in the review."
"941",5,"  Can't wait to see this!! The sad comments by alt-right idiots notwithstanding..."
"942",1,"  Too many racist undertones . I could've been a great movie, but they didn't really follow the story and made raise a big part of it. Not worth your time or money"
"943",1,"  Saw it, another comic ripoff. Nice to know there was no huge dog at the end of the movie. Now the critics are either on the take with the studio or they are trying to be PC for the people that read their reviews, that's the only thing that can explain such a ludicrously high rating for what amounts to be a very mediocre action flick."
"944",5,"  It's clear to me that most of the people in the ""Not Interested"" section seem racist as h*ll. All I see most of them saying that it's impossible for this movie to have gained critical praise and that it's an SJW conspiracy. A movie with an all Black cast can only be bad or average? Besides, this is no propaganda movie, it's a Marvel film that is SET IN AFRICA and doesn't intend to be anything more than that, and I'm looking forward to it."
"945",5,"  im going to be seeing this february 16th lat @ night. ;)"
"946",1,"  Just returned from the theater, the movie was interesting, but not worth recommending to others. In regards to the marvel universe, Black Panther lacks a charm that makes others worth watching repeatedly. There was too much randomness that didnt align with a productive storyline. Was interesting, but I am not too enthusiastic about the film. 1-2 stars as a superhero movie, 1 star as a action movie in general."
"947",1,"  just an Ok movie, nothing special about this"
"948",3,"  Wakanda to the world, thinking it should start from Africa not the States. Michael Jordan had the best performance"
"949",5,"  Oh yea I can't wait!!"
"950",1,"  It has some flashy visuals and everyone holds a spear, but the plot is silly and most of the characters other than the protagonist himself are unlikable, especially his sister. I really don't understand why this movie has managed to wow critics when better movies than it have been snubbed. Its not particularly beautiful, and it has a lot of obvious CGI. It was about as enjoyable as Thor: The Dark World. I can think of worse movies, but I can think of much better movies as well. Its definitely one of the worst Marvel movies, with the exception of the aforementioned Thor film. Its also better than Fan 4 stic. By the time it was over I was pretty bored. Wish I had not bought into the hype about this movie, since it is massively overrated."
"951",1,"  Bad character development. Sad to see some really good actors having to bear playing in this total failure."
"952",1,"  This felt like a Michael bay movie, they spent too much time on special fx instead of the dialog. I can't get over how awful the acting was. They tried way too hard, but thats how 99% of Marvel movies are these days. Marvel movies dont have the rewatchability like most other movies, especially Black Panther...Try again Marvel!"
"953",1,"  Boring movie. Very political. Not worth seeing. Has zero marvel quality."
"954",1,"  This movie made an enema seem pleasurable."
"955",5,"  cant wait to see this movie it looks awesome"
"956",5,"  Well done. Good villain. Good acting. Very good for a comic book movie"
"957",5,"  As a fan of the Black Panther comic, I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. The costumes were gorgeous!"
"958",1,"  Boring plot, poor acting. Do not waste your time."
"959",1,"  Aside from Black Panther and his fictional African country being EVERYTHING Trump is all about... even down to the wall around it! I think this was the most terrible movie I've ever seen."
"960",0.5,"  Not really interested, looks like a B grade marvel movie. Still will go to see and review"
"961",1,"  The movie did not live up to all the hype. Just another cookie cutter super hero movie with the same old rehearsed fight scenes."
"962",5,"  This is the fantastisc!"
"963",1,"  What a piece of crap....lackluster...some special effects visuals...story was weak...cast was ok...not that great....sorry, cannot just say it's good for the hell of it....the good aspects were its connection to the MCU...that is all...pretty crappy in my opinion....do better next time Marvel...."
"964",1,"  it's so horribly overrated."
"965",5,"  I can't wait to see this masterpiece."

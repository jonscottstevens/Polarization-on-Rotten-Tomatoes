"1",3.5,"  I enjoyed this movie. It slowed down too much in the middle for my liking, but the animation is really beautiful."
"2",5,"  I'm an old Nana and still am attached to my old Beatrix Potter books. But I still LOVED this movie! Absolutely delightful and plenty of laughs. People need to view movies with open minds."
"3",3.5,"  When it switches to the traditional illustrated animation of Beatrix Potter's paint and line work it's like magic. Well produced, designed and directed. The story is a little flat, and drags in places BUT the jokes are enough to keep a 7 year old and 9 year old on the ground crying with laughter. Domhall and Daisy FINALLY put on good performances in a movie. All round good fun for the family."
"4",4,"  Tremendous fun. Made me laugh."
"5",3.5,"  'Peter Rabbit' is a surprisingly fun film which successfully blends live action comedy with impressively expressive animation."
"6",4,"  Surprised me and was an amazing adaptation from the beloved books"
"7",4,"  Really funny family film. You have to wonder what these reviewers who give bad reviews see. Perhaps they should sit in a room full of families rather than sombre serious people looking for the next great thing. Lighten up! Family loved it. Laughed all the way through."
"8",3,"  That whirring noise you hear throughout the film is Beatrix Potter turning in her grave. Okay it's not that bad and to be honest this Peter Rabbit meets Home Alone is entertaining enough. Updates of old characters are not that uncommon these days - Batman, the whole output of Boomerang etc so it's only fair that Peter Rabbit gets it too although he already has on CBeebies. Some of the older concepts seem rather dated and quite frankly objectionable - thinking Rabbit pie here. James Corden as the voice? Well I'm not sure about that. However his performance is OSCAR worthy compared to his last one in the awful Emoji Movie."
"9",0.5,"  Awful on so many levels. Peter is naughty and rude at best, a pre-meditated murderer at worse. The film is crass and has a poor script. Very disappointing. My child was very upset that Peter tried to kill for a second time by firing a blackberry into Mr mcGregor's mouth even though he was allergic to it. He would have died had he not had an EpiPen. After we had a spell in hospital with anaphylaxis, this was really offensive and scary. Peter is a complete lefty marxisit who wants to take what others work for. just wholey bad bad bad"
"10",2,"  I didn't find it very funny and think it would have been better with potters original cartoon rather than this cgi rubbish. But the children in the cinema seemed to enjoy the violence a lot so I guess I just got old"
"11",1.5,"  If this wasn't ""Peter Rabbit"" but some generic animated film, I would have had far less problems with it. It is funny in places, and entertaining, but in the first half of the film displays an almost malicious under current with the rabbits dialogue more akin to some feral gang. I didn't really want my kids (5, 7, 9) to be watching it and siding with the rabbits. It's clearly been written with an American market in mind. By the end, the tone has changed and I don't consider the film a complete dead loss, but it's such a waste of potential. Paddington showed twice that you can retain the heart and charm of the original characters and themes. Peter rabbit is a lazy lowest common denominator effort that exists on the brash and lairy and a delight in violence that simply wasn't part of the potters original characters. Hence, in watching this I feel more like something was stolen from me rather than I wasn't intentional something new - a new worthy interpretation. It's like going to see the next terminator film only to find out it's about how humanity and skynet worked out their differences after a terminator fell in love with a resistance fighter, and most of the film unfolds in Shakespearian parlance. I ordered a hotdog, why did you bring me a falafel? I mean, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this felafel, other than the obvious fact it's not a hotdog. And that's real pity because I really wanted to like this film much more than I did, and really didn't have huge expectations, it was just so very far from the mark."
"12",5,"  Love it! Havent a good laugh in a long time"
"13",4,"  This movie has just enough comedy targeted at adults to keep you interested."
"14",2.5,"  The visuals of nowadays animation movies are absolutely mind-boggling. Even if it's only for this, this flick is worthwhile, even for an adult, as the animals, in their basic aspect as well as in their movements look perfectly real. I quite enjoyed it, though it is naturally more of a juvenile movie. The sound track has some good underlying Brit songs which give this flick a special touch. 5/10 points."
"15",1,"  Very disappointing. The whole thing was extremely violent. The rabbits gloriously celebrated the death of Mr. McGregor (they showed him die and Peter poking the eye of his dead body) and the rest was them brutalizing Mr. McGregor?s nephew, who constantly tried to murder them. The entire movie was filled with adult themes and humor. Certainly did no justice to Beatrix Potter. Should have screened this one better."
"16",3,"  A fun kids film, some laughs for adults, but maybe the most unlikeable main character I've seen for a long time, ."
"17",2.5,"  Petter rabbit tell us a funny story but it falls in a movie with anything fresh for the genere"
"18",1,"  Awful movie. There are a few funny parts, but this movie is not appropriate for kids. Let's start with watching a man die; he falls to the ground and dies. The rabbit's attitude is ""Oh well"" and then says the man deserved to die. Immediately after this death, the rabbit begins partying and moves into the man's house, because he says he deserves it. Then there is the long drawn out romance and kissing scenes between the human woman and human man that take up way too much of the movie. So many kids are turned off by that. I love kid movies, but this one is definitely not one to love. Extremely disappointing."
"19",0.5,"  Terrible, listening to that buffoon corden is torture"
"20",0.5,"  Ever since his father was put in a pie and eaten up by the grumpy old farmer Mr. McGregor (Sam Neill), Peter Rabbit (James Corden), his sisters Flopsy (Margot Robbie), Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki) and Cotton-tail (Daisy Ridley) and his cousin Benjamin Bunny (Colin Moody) spend their lives stealing vegetables from his garden, while also spending time with their human guardian Bea (Rose Byrne) who loves animals and painting. When Mr. McGregor dies of a fatal heart-attack, Peter thinks that his troubles are over for good. But when the old farmer's snooty nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) moves into the house with bigger and better rabbit-traps than ever, Peter vows to drive him out forever, especially when Thomas starts falling for Bea....Before J.K Rowling brought Hogwarts to life, before J.R.R Tolkien took readers to the mystical land of Middle-Earth, hell even before Michael Bond introduced a lovable bear with a passion for marmalade, the most iconic series of children's literature that ever existed were the stories published by Beatrix Potter. One of the most important contributors to the conservation of the Lake District and the National Trust, she was best known for the publication of her animal stories between 1902 to 1930 with her most well-known creation being the mischievous Peter Rabbit. Since then her stories have been adapted multiple times over the years, from a 1971 ballet film, A CGI show on Nickelodeon, the autobiographical film in 2006 Miss Potter, which told the story of her tragic relationship with her publisher Frederick Warne and finally The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, a 1992 animated mini-series that, in this reviewer's opinion, is one of the most beautiful, underrated examples of British Animation which isn't suprising as it was created by Dianne Jackson, best known as the director of the more famous short The Snowman who sadly passed way in the middle of the show's production.Making a live-action adaptation of these timeless stories was admittedly going to be a hard task to do in this day and age where adaptations are the norm and trying to remain faithful to the spirit of the source material while also doing your own spin on it can make or break a task like this. But as Paul King's excellent Paddington films have shown us, it isn't impossible. So what do you after watching those examples........................................................................................................................you give it to the same Dick-heads who thought twerking Nativity doves and a movie about Emojis was a good idea!Of all the terrible live-action reboots that have disgraced the silver screen over the years such as Josie and the Pussycats, Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas, this may be the worst example of those films ever made. Taking Sony Pictures Animation's worst traits which include desperately trying to be hip and cool with kids, obnoxious comic-relief and adding in so many dated pop songs in their soundtracks and amping them up to eleven in this modernized train-wreck is an insult not only those timeless stories, but is a giant middle-finger to adaptations in general. Look, I know that directors and screenwriters have to change things up from time to time, but they at least either try to keep the spirit of the original story intact or tell an equally timeless story themselves that can stand on it's own as an excellent film on it's own right, like Disney's Animated films.This does neither as it's story is so cliched, predictable and boring that one can even notice that Sony has blatantly taken the entire plot from their own Hotel Transylvania in it's narrative structure of someone finally getting rid of his enemy, only to discover that another enemy has decided to live on their land and fall in love with a female relative of the protagonist.Aside from Sam Neill's amusing cameo as the classic Mr. McGregor and Domhnall Gleeson getting a few funny moments as the overly snooty Thomas, the cast ranging from James Corden's obnoxious Peter Rabbit, Daisy Ridley's annoying ""weird"" sister Cotton-tail, Rose Byrne's awful ""Pixie-Dream Girl"" stereotype Bea and the cameos of other Beatrix Potter characters ranging from Sia's Mrs. Tiggy Winkle who encourages theft and vandalism, Ewan Leslie's Pigling Bland, once one of the politest and nicest characters in Potter's stories whose now reduced to a bad running gag in which he has an eating disorder and screams all the time, and the once terrifying Mr. Tod (Fayssal Bazzi) whose now obsessed with streaking and parties, are all so painful to watch that it, (I can't believe I'm saying this) makes the Transformers from the Michael Bay films look more closer to their own source material than these examples.Animal Logic's skill in creating some of the most incredible character animation as seen in the Lego movies and Happy Feet is sadly wasted here, as aside from one sequence that uses some beautiful hand-drawn animation drawn in the art style of the books that shows Peter's backstory and the death of his father, most of the realistic character animation is not suitable for a film like this.Overall, Sony Animation's Peter Rabbit is a travesty of a film that spits, shits and vomits on the legacy of Miss Potter and serves as further proof as to why Sony has one of the worst mainstream animation studios out there. You'd think that their recent Razzie Awards for The Emoji Movie would teach them a lesson, apparently not!"
"21",5,"  It was a really enjoyable movie even being a kid's movie. I really liked it. Very funny"
"22",3,"  I enjoyed the film... loved Hux & Rey... I mean, Domhnall Gleeson and Daisy's characters. They stole the show for me. Peter himself was gawd damn awful... in terms of personality and Corden's wooden, read directly from the script, emotionless voice acting. Was he the best they could find? He made Peter annoying as hell. Rose Byrne's character wasn't that fun either. Still, Domhnall & Daisy made up for it. Take your kids... fun family movie."
"23",3.5,"  its a sweet and funny movie. that's safe for kids and enjoyable for adults."
"24",4,"  Cute and funny, sure to entertain the kids."
"25",1.5,"  noooooooooooooooooooooo"
"26",3,"  Delightful and charming. Peter Rabbit is not perfect, but certainly kept the children rocking with laughter as they watched the naughty rabbit cause mayhem in MacGregor's garden. The animation is impressive and almost seamlessly weaves into live action, and then into Beatrix Potter's classic water colours. Enjoyed the poignant backstory reflections of Peter's father without being overly melodramatic. A fun film even for the adults."
"27",4.5,"  Perfectly blended movie of the original story with pop culture, as well as the right temperature for a family. This film appeals to both kids and adults. Best ""kids' movie"" I have seen in a long while!"
"28",5,"  Adorable, humorous, charming and a heartwarming tale just in time for Easter and spring! You will be hopping as fast as you can to catch up with the rabbits and all the other animals that are, once again, calculating how to get into Mr. McGregor's Garden. Peter Rabbit is based on the books by Beatrix Potter. Beatrix Potter lived from 1866 to 1943 and is one of the best-loved children's authors. She wrote and illustrated 28 books and each one has been translated into more than 35 languages. They have sold over 100 million copies. This is important because one of the main goals for the director and the cast was to stay true to her vision. The beauty of this film is that the rabbits all look as if you could touch them because the animation is so life like. The scenes with the garden and house look like places that I would enjoy living because they look like a fairytale that came alive. Of course, if you don't share your vegetables your life will not be enjoyable. The moral of the film is about getting along with others, telling the truth and being honest. Everyone makes mistakes and we need to find a way to fix them. Thump, click, crack, snap, thud - all these noises, plus thousands of other sounds effects add to the humor of this film. The music is outstanding. I cannot wait to purchase the soundtrack. There is a combination of movie symphony music, sounds from the 80s, new original songs and a plethora of songs and sounds that will put a smile on your face. Of course, the comical James Corden makes a perfect bunny. Peter Rabbit is my favorite character, full of sassy and classy moves and words of wisdom. His humorous and quick-witted lines made me burst out laughing when I watched the film. He also has a very kind heart, which I love. Corden brings his quirky personality that we see on his late night television show to this part.On the other hand, I also love the adorable Flopsy (Margot Robbie). She is so cute and cuddly, knows how to fend for herself and I just love her. She is the perfect role model for kids because she teaches how you can be both smart, cute and a fighter. Margot Robbie adds a bit of quirkiness to this character because she is the one and only Harley Quinn. She is the complete opposite - serious and tough - in the recent movie Christopher Robin. I loved meeting her in person.My favorite scene is when Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) is electrified by the bunnies. This scene is absolutely hilarious and quirky. I could not stop laughing. Seeing bunnies figuring out how to use an electric fence was shocking. Ever caring, kind Bea (Rose Byrne) is the sweetest. She is the hero who protects the animals at all costs. I relate to her a lot. She is funny and a bite odd. Cotton-Tail (Daisy Ridley) is one tough bunny. You know that this film is magnificent when the star of Star Wars appears in it. Cotton-Tail is young, yet very feisty and tough. It reminds me of her character in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I recommend this film for ages 6 to 18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. Kids will adore the bunnies and the other talking animals. The teenagers will love the hummer and fun scenes that the younger kids don't understand. This film is a perfect for the entire family so grab a bag of carrots, radishes and turnips and head to the theaters.Reviewed by morgan b., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org"
"29",0.5,"  THIS MOVIE ISN'T JUST GENERIC ITS SURPRISINGLY EVEN WORSE THAN THAT.  18%"
"30",4.5,"  Very cute and family friendly. I took my 3 year old son and 13 year old cousin. We all enjoyed the movie and several laughs along the way. This was my son's 2nd in theater experience, the movie held his attention and he is repeating scenes and dialog back to me, over a week later."
"31",2.5,"  Only 3 things good for this. No potty jokes, some actually good jokes and magic animation. But it was so boring! When i saw it at the cinema i talked with my friends the whole time. We talked how bad the movie was. So many good things could happen and didnt."
"32",5,"  Me and my grandson went this see with two other pen classes laughs constantly and I loved it. The storyline and the action thru out the the movie was great and very unexpected you don't know what's coming next.. And so cute . graphics awesome"
"33",5,"  fantastic animation!"
"34",3.5,"  For an adaptation of a beloved children's book, this movie is not half-bad."
"35",5,"  I absolutely LOVE this movie!!!!"
"36",2.5,"  Character development was nothing but trash itself, not even the whole plot can make the writing better only the animation saved this film"
"37",5,"  For children perfect"
"38",4.5,"  Great family film, my 4 year old got a little bored fir the last half hour. I'd recommend x"
"39",5,"  Kids loved it and so did I!!!! Great movie."
"40",5,"  Fuuny movie. I watched the movie with my kids and enjoyed it as much as the kids did."
"41",0.5,"  Peter rabbit's animation looks just like the smurfs, & has a way different plot from its book. It is by far, Daisy Ridely's worst movie."
"42",5,"  My husband and I went to see this movie shortly after it came out. It is my new favorite animated movie. It does not have much of the ""Shrek"" humor, more of ""Home Alone"" type of antics. Kept true to the story book with a modern twist. Loved it so much!"
"43",0.5,"  Peter Rabbit attempts to use repetitive humour to save this predictable and unenjoyable film."
"44",3,"  I wanted to like this film and felt it would be fun but I just found it fairly crass and annoying. There are some good bits of slapstick humour and a few good puns. But what really ground my gears was James Corden and his constant loudness and overbearingness.The original books (as far as I can remember from my bunny years) were pretty alright and genteel. But I felt this was written by a London ghetto creature imposing themselves on the countryside. Like there was a point where all these animals go into the house, party and trash the place. And I just felt NO. This isn't respectful to the original at all and its not fun. Then another scene where the sweet singing sparrows keep falling out the sky or are hit by catapults by the bunnies. And it was just like no, you're ruining the spirit of this!The annoying thing is it was constant action, constant James Cordon being James Cordon. It did have some good points and was funny in places. On the whole I enjoyed it, but I want to cork James Cordon's mouth with a big fat carrot and rewrite the script so it was a bit more nuanced and 3-dimensional."
"45",3.5,"  brilliant cgi and animal characterisation - innovative treatment of an old favourite - some mistakes with violence and house trashing broke the spell for me"
"46",4.5,"  Cute. Entertained the kids and adults."
"47",1.5,"  Makes Vague Attempts To Hark Back To The Original Cartoon & Bring Things Forth Into A Modern Retell, Which Is All Well & Good. The Downside Is The Overt Focus On Slapstick & Innuendo Adult-Humor, Which Confuses The Genre & Overall Mood. There Is Much Fun Within Things, But It All Coulda Been Done Much, Much Better. I Tired Quickly Of The 'Wylie Coyote' Genre That Peter Rabbit Imbues As He Attempts To Steal & Mock His Nemesis..Loses Its Way As Things Side Step Ms Potter's Charming Ideal Of Rabbits."
"48",5,"  Its funny and enjoyable movie including alots of fun in thid movie..!! But i don get it why its need to be PG13 nothing is so wrong on that movie...!!!"
"49",5,"  Loved it. Funny, spirited, musical, just plain fun."
"50",3,"  most enjoyable - loved peter rabbit"
"51",5,"  I wondered if an adult I would enjoy it with the kids but I was greatly surprised but the acting and animation. I laughed at many scenes. Good Job."
"52",4,"  didn't like the book as a kid, absolutely loved the movie"
"53",4.5,"  I loved this movie. I really liked the fact that someone made a cute movie where one of the animal characters didn't have to die (like in jungle book.....bambie.....etc. Animation was excellent. Story was cute. Kinda tom and jerry type comedy. One complaint is the trailers spoiled some of the best fun gags in the movie, so that was a bummer. But really a great time watching this movie. I don't understand why more people didn't give it great ratings."
"54",5,"  Kids loved it, very entertaining"
"55",5,"  Great fun. Soundtrack was really good. Corden was endearing. So many Star Wars people involved... Daisy Ridley, Domnall Gleason,Rose Byrne, and Rob Coleman."
"56",5,"  AMAZING film!!! Very funny & for me a childhood classic was brought to life. Well worth a visit!!!"
"57",5,"  So far the best family movie all year. To those SJW types. get a life."
"58",1.5,"  Would have made a cute 20 minute movie before a movie movie or background muted movie at an Easter egg hunt... either way I'm glad I only paid for one of my three kids to see it with me."
"59",1.5,"  Felt compelled to review this in case people thought it would be a charming movie about a beloved character. Aside from the odd comedy moment it was awful from start to finish. My little boy asked me if it was 'still the Peter Rabbit movie' at one point because it had veered off in some random direction. I felt most sorry for the family next to us who had brought their very elderly grand mother who presumably was looking forward to enjoying a beautiful movie with a classic character but instead got this. If we had been nearer the aisle I would have left the cinema and I've never felt like that before."
"60",5,"  I've been to see this yesterday evening after 30 long horrible minutes of being stuck in a cold queue. But never mind that!Everyone comes to the cinema expecting a lovely storyline, a talented cast, non-stop humour, and even better - James Corden. This movie has a lot of that.Yes, I have to be honest, I've enjoyed this movie from start to finish! Even the audience seemed to have enjoyed it! If it was just a cartoon movie, I wouldn't like it at all.But it seems to me that this is better and funnier than The Emoji Movie.I'm not into reading the original Peter Rabbit books, granted, but this film really shows that Peter Rabbit is a sweet character, even though he might not be the same as Paddington.Seriously, if you miss this film, you'll be having a meltdown!"
"61",4,"  My son loved it. The entire theatre laughed throughout and my son couldn't stop talking about his favourite parts afterwards. Forget what the critics think - a happy child = a good movie."
"62",2.5,"  Great for kids. Not too bad for adults. Very well made. Nice scenes of London."
"63",5,"  Loved this film really not sure what the bad reviews are about. My 5 year old was LOL as were most of the Cheltenham audience"
"64",4.5,"  Funny and enjoyable."
"65",5,"  Funny funny funny! Must see movie. Our family had a blast!"
"66",5,"  ME ENATAR ESTA TAMBIEN PERO QUE LATIMA QUE NO ESTE LA LILY BOBNMEN, PERO LA PELICULA DEBWE DE ESTARA RE BUENA,"
"67",5,"  I went into it expecting to hate it. It was adorable. The story was entertaining and full of laughs. Lots of jokes for kids and parents. I hadn't seen any trailers, I had only word of mouth ideas on the quality of the movie. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The kids were both raving the whole way home. I especially enjoyed that it wasn't just a retelling, but an entirely new story."
"68",3,"  Not bad. Not to corny get jokes fun for the whole family. Go check it out. Worth seeing with the kids"
"69",1,"  I can't stand to hear James Cordons irritating voice but appart from that I'm unbiased in my opinion. The movie is terrible."
"70",3.5,"  I thought I would hate this movie and that my 5yo daughter would be bored to death. However, it was surprisingly fun to watch! My daughter actually LOVED it. Even my husband liked the movie, which is saying a lot."
"71",1,"  How to ruin a great childhood story"
"72",5,"  fun and entertaining, pleasantly surprised."
"73",4,"  Unique story surprised me! Like Babe movie"
"74",5,"  Grew up with the books and it is a great fun film for kids."
"75",1.5,"  My 3 year old wanted to see this movie so bad. I took him and he made it 45 minutes in and taped my hand said ""Daddy, I want to go home and play outside..."" I was so thankful. The movie was boring, forced, and reeks of pre-screenings, corporate meetings, and focus groups. I got a refund, took my kid home and we played in the sandbox together. So all in all I got a pleasant experience out of this movie."
"76",0.5,"  Way to ruin another story with PC writing and CGI. Oh well, does anyone care anymore?"
"77",4,"  I did not expect much from this movie but I found it to be very entertaining."
"78",5,"  the best movies ever"
"79",0.5,"  cgi isn't getting any better, But they keep filling their movies with the defective crap anyway."
"80",5,"  It's fun and funny. I laughed out loud a few times and the kids were entertained."
"81",5,"  hahaha this some funny stuff"
"82",5,"  Me and my nephew (7 years) ABSOLUTELY, loved this movie. it was so adorable and funny. i ABSOLUTELY loved the casting, the voices of the bunnies. 10/10 i would give this film."
"83",3,"  me gustaria ir aver esta pelicula porque es divertida y entretenida la recomiendo pero ,la voy puntuar con un tomate."
"84",2.5,"  A trailer is just like the 2016 movie ""Ghostbusters"". I Am not a really sarcastic."
"85",3.5,"  fun for the whole family. Much better than i thought it would be."
"86",3.5,"  My seven year old daughter liked it a lot. I will say as an adult, i didn't mind it. Silly nonsense but cute and enjoyable. I appreciated the fact that it was on the shorter side for movies."
"87",3,"  Cute movie and cute live action with animation. Gleeson and byrne are sweet together. Very funny!!! Not the Peter of the books though, be forewarned."
"88",3.5,"  pOUR UN film de famille c'est bien (et CA L'AIR QUE LE NOUVEAU LOOK DE rOTTENtOMATOES MET LES COMMENTAIRES UN MAJUSCULE :( )"
"89",4,"  I took my grandkids. We all lovEd it. There were many laugh outloud moments and i loved the way it Incorporated the author Into the story. I am glad i don't always let reviews make my decision about movies."
"90",4,"  Cute movie, loved the setting- really good if you're looking for a feel good movie that's easy to follow. Yeah, it's predictable and corny at times, but IT's Honest in it's intentions and isn't tRying to be more then what it is."
"91",5,"  I loved the movie. It was funny and light hearted."
"92",5,"  I think it was a really good movie."
"93",3.5,"  Raving rabbits. So you may already know the story of this rabbit named Peter who wears a blue jacket and repeatedly tries to get into his neighbor's vegetable garden for obvious reasons. This is taking it to the next level, and Peter (James Corden) has so many tricks up his sleeve that he will likely murder someone if he's not careful. I really only watched this in theaters because 1. I have a MoviePass, and 2. a mostly positive review caught my attention. I really haven't forgiven James Corden for being the worst part of the worst movie that came out in all of 2017 in The Emoji Movie, so I wasn't chomping at the bit to support his next project. When I had heard that he is actually unknowingly the villain in his own story, it was a dynamic that caught my attention. This movie is surprisingly decent. Now I could have very well just been in the right mood for this, but this was exactly what I was looking for on a lazy day off. The animation looks pretty good all things considered, and there is mischief, pranks and shenanigans throughout. I never at any point got bored with this, and while I may not have been getting big belly laughs, I did get a lot of chuckles and smiles watching this rabbit make Domhnall Gleeson's life a living hell. And speaking of Domhnall, he is having a lot of fun in this role. I don't know if he has any children or not, but sometimes actors want to let their proverbial hair down and do something wacky like this for kids to enjoy, and if their heart is in it, it will translate very well to the audience. That is exactly what happens here. Surprisingly, there is actually a controversy surrounding this film involving a plot point with a food allergy. While I will admit that it is kind of messed up when you see it happen, it felt in step with these somewhat malicious rabbits, and it didn't bother me all that much. This is cute and significantly better than it looks. I do think that kids will really like this, or if you just enjoy family films like I do, you are just going to have a good time with this. It doesn't do anything groundbreaking, and it is predictable as the story plays out, but it actually does a good job of setting up recurring jokes, and it is just better executed than you probably expect. I give Peter Rabbit an unexpected recommendation."
"94",5,"  AnimaTionn is fanastic. Rabbit actually hop. Plot is about love, changiing attitude, and admiting your actions. Warning dealth at beginning is not considered as bad. It is key to plot however."
"95",2.5,"  Pass me the carrots...............Mopsy, Flopsy, and Cotton-tail------juvenile delinquents.Okay for the little ones, but don't expect it to follow the book. Expect it to follow the Den of Thieves! Politically correct shaming for mocking allergies---say it ain't true! For your $8 you'll get $6.91 worth of entertainment, but your kids will be happy...."
"96",4,"  This movie is very funny, but for it's intention to be funny, it sometimes messes up charming moments."
"97",5,"  LOVED IT! SAW THIS WITH MY 12 DAUGHTER AND LITERALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD THE WHOLE TIME. IT'S KID-LEVEL HUMOR WITH GROWNUP SMARTS. DON'T ANALYZE IT-JUST ENJOY IT."
"98",3,"  Fun for younger audiences or fans of the books, but no story interesting enough for adults."
"99",3.5,"  Yes the second half of the movie is full of clichés and most of its jokes are silly and repeated, but the movie is a sweet adventure that has surprisingly smart slapstick humor, gorgeous 3D animation and good voice acting specially from James Corden who voiced the titular character."
"100",5,"  I loved this movie, it was ADORABLE AND VERY CHARMING."
"101",4,"  a fun and hilarious movie and an enjoyable movie to watch with a family"
"102",3.5,"  Decent and fun film for the family. A couple memorable scenes to walk away with. Memorable characters. What movie did the critics watch?"
"103",5,"  This movie was wonderful. I loved it as much as my kids (11, 9 and 6)"
"104",5,"  Loved it!!! The technical aspect of it is fascinating."
"105",4.5,"  How this excellent movie get rotten in here, and by adults ???They must rate this film by children, not adults...And why nowadays adults so fragile, and told this movie so violent ???"
"106",3.5,"  This was a fun movie, think of an animal to people movie from the perspective of the Killer Rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Good visuals, but also awesome sight gags, dialogue, and pretty good jokes. Definitely entertaining!!"
"107",5,"  The movie was good and fun"
"108",5,"  Great family movie. Entertains the kids and adults. The soundtrack is also enjoyable enough for adults that I may actually download it! It's real music (Bon Iver, and some 90's favorites that parents will appreciate and not contrived Disney crap)"
"109",3,"  Not the Peter Rabbit I remembered from childhood. I half expected this lagomorph to whip out his iphone to tweet to the twitterverse. While this film was diverting enough for my six year old daughter, I found myself rooting for Domhnall Gleason to make some rabbit stew."
"110",3,"  It was okay. It had it's moments. I still find it odd that most ""kids"" movies seem to be aimed more at ""adults"" now. I don't find it surprising given the current culture - just odd."
"111",4,"  Super cute! Great movie if you want to see something somwrhinfg light hearted and fun!"
"112",2,"  This movie tries its best to amuse little kids. There are countless ""butt jokes"". It's very obvious that the creators attempted at making this a funny movie. Ultimately, the amusement and jokes fail. This movie had a lot of potential, but unfortunately, it didn't meet up to these expectations."
"113",0.5,"  The reason this movie does not succeed is because it is illogical. Peter rabbit is a disappointment."
"114",4,"  Went with my niece and my nephew, it was cute I really enjoyed it"
"115",5,"  It's nonstop fun with comedy for everyone!!!!!!"
"116",3,"  Story was lacking in some spots. Animation was great, great cast."
"117",3.5,"  Cute good fun, especially one for date night. James Corden's humor shines bright."
"118",2,"  I have seen it. it's not that bad but its a bit of a let down"
"119",5,"  Super cute for the kids!"
"120",4,"  I never read the books as a kid or anything like that, so as a movie I really enjoyed it. I found it an amusing movie that I don't mind watching a third time. I seemed to have enjoyed it as much as the elderly couple behind me in the theatre. I don't need a complex plot to make me feel like I just watched a good/decent movie."
"121",0.5,"  Horrible scene where they almost murdered a a person by taking advantage of his allergies."
"122",1.5,"  Didn't we learn anything from the Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day movie?"
"123",4.5,"  Super funny movie for kids and adults"
"124",3,"  Fired Up!: Hilarious!Easy A: Hilarious and Charming. Even better!Man, this guy is on a roll...Friends With Benefits: Meh.Annie: Uh oh.Peter Rabbit: Who are you, Will Gluck?...I liked it more than I probably care to admit..."
"125",0.5,"  Probably the best animated movie of all time! I love when peter got shot in a dark alley way and bled to death. Awesome acting and cg ilke star wars episode 1. i miss peter laugh please comeback I love you and rweally want yoour love"
"126",0.5,"  Rabbits r gay and autistic."
"127",3,"  RT rating has this one exactly right at 58/60. I enjoyed the wholesome just- like-I-remember-it-as-a-kid feel of the book. Young children will enjoy this. At the risk of curmudgeoning, I feel that the birds suddenly rapping and singing popular songs spontaneously took away from it for me. It had some other elements of that formulaic snarky self-awareness that plagues all modern adapted films. And even (spoiler of a spoiler alert) fell back on the campy stepping on multiple rakes gag. (Deep breath). Overall, though, my family of Middle age, young adult, and grade schoolers enjoyed it."
"128",4,"  If you have little ones who are familiar with Peter Rabbit then go see it with them. Plenty of laughs for the adults and great time spent together with the kids."
"129",3.5,"  Cute. And better than I expected."
"130",4,"  Peter Rabbit - Review (2018)The Good Its much better than its suppose to be The Running gag with the Birds singing The Stellar cast - Domhnall Gleeson, Rose Byrne, Sam Neill, James Corden, Daisy Ridley, Margot RobbieThe CGI animation is pretty good Its cute and warm hearting for the entire family The Electric fence gag The Bad The story is quite simple The weird choices of songsSam Neil is quite wasted some what Overall: This was a fine alright kids movie to watch Overall Grade: B+"
"131",1.5,"  This is a bastardization of the lovable rabbit we know and love."
"132",5,"  i dunno i actually really liked it because it was cute. sometimes you dont really need to analyze things in order to enjoy them."
"133",0.5,"  worst movie for childrens"
"134",2,"  This is probably a fun movie for the little ones. Age range 2 to 5 years old. Unfortunately, where movies like Ice age and other animated blockbusters have something to offer for everyone, Peter Rabbit gets stuck in seen-before slapstick sequences and repeated chase-scenes. The story-line is bumpy, like the writers were struggling with their lack of imagination and originality. It's difficult to actually say something about this movie, because the moment it's finished you've already forgotten you've watched it. I'm sure the Beatrix Potter-fans have something more to say about this movies. I have never read the books about Peter Rabbit, so I wasn't influenced while watching, but certainly wasn't impressed. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter"
"135",5,"  I thought this movie was charming. My grandchildren and I enjoyed the story and the humor very much. They talked about the movie for day's after seeing it. It was refreshing to watch."
"136",1.5,"  Actually a let down, I loved the books as a kid and unfortunately this just lacked all the charm of the books and the whimsy."
"137",1,"  Not the Peter rabbit I remember."
"138",4,"  This is a fun movie for the kids and adults. I laughed a lot."
"139",5,"  Very entertaining for the whole family. Ignore the Critics."
"140",5,"  I thought it was a great movie. Funny and clever."
"141",5,"  It was a great movie! If you want a good laugh this is the movie for you!!! Domhnall Gleeson did an amazing job! James Corden and Daisy Ridley were spectacular as well! I loved the movie so much!"
"142",3,"  It was a good show, just not a great one. Had funny moments."
"143",3,"  A very cute and funny movie. Decent enough to keep an adult interested throughout. The jokes were aimed at both adults and children and were reasonably funny. The only thing that didn't really fit was the poor choice of soundtrack music - modern pop songs just didn't fit with the countryside idyll the film was trying to portray."
"144",5,"  This movie is great. It is truth that 90% now that movie are fallling for their neighbors. Like one of my friend does. But there are no such things as talking rabbits. But....the movie were fun."
"145",2.5,"  Cute, but not the true heart-warming portrayal I was hoping for. Too many adult themes for kids (wild partying and seemingly high or drunk characters) and too shallow for adults. We didn't get to know the characters enough to love them and I felt jipped by Peter's shallowness.  The movie was amusing, there were a lot of cute tender moments, but not enough to leave you satisfied with what the real story of Peter Rabbit was truly all about."
"146",3,"  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
"147",3,"  Great animation and the rabbits looked wonderful. Peter's bullying arrogance and frat boy mentality felt uncomfortable and forced, far from the spirit of the source material."
"148",0.5,"  James Cordes doesn't belong in movies"
"149",5,"  Peter Rabbit is the best movie of the century, honestly if you haven't seen it, you haven't lived. The physical comedy done by Domhnall Gleeson is absolutely hilarious. The voice acting by Daisy Ridley, Margot Robbie and more were impeccable. The CGI is stunning and believeable, it's got a nice story that your kids, teens, adults and seniors will love. Literally everyone will love it. I reccomend Peter Rabbit to anything that breathes, even things that don't breathe, so kids, bring your pet rock."
"150",2.5,"  A modern take on a childhood classic that feels slightly dated in its comedic execution."
"151",5,"  I hated it it so much i barfed"
"152",4.5,"  This was quite a fun romp. Lots of themes on loss and love this movie comes out a winner. I really enjoyed it and look forward to more Peter Rabbits!"
"153",2.5,"  Not nearly as bad as the 2010 Alvin or Smurfs movie. There are things I liked and things I didn't like. Its alright :) I was kind of pleasantly surprised."
"154",5,"  I love buns and I loved this movie"
"155",5,"  Cute and funny. Love cheesy in spots..but I like that combined with cute and funny"
"156",4,"  Cute film. Kids loved it. The rooster was hysterical!"
"157",4,"  Very funny and entertaining! Kept my four year son laughing out loud:)"
"158",3.5,"  Probably kids 8-12 would like this movie the most. Its not really meant for kids under 6. You may have to have a discussion about DEATH if you let your 4 or 5 year old see it."
"159",3.5,"  Omgz it was so adorable. What it has to do with the original books, I have no idea. But it was cute and funny and I that's probably all that really matters."
"160",3,"  The American retelling of the British classic, Peter Rabbit, is adequate as fodder for parents who want to bring their young children to the movies for more than ten minutes of peace and quiet.  Headlined by amiable late-night host James Corden, the increasingly ubiquitous Domnhall Gleeson, comedy vet Rose Byrne, and the voices of ""Star Wars stud"" Daisy Ridley and recent Academy Award nominee Margot Robbie, Peter Rabbit was guaranteed to have some charm and the well-rounded ensemble helps keep Peter Rabbit afloat. James Corden's Peter Rabbit is sometimes obnoxious, always mischievous, but generally charismatic; at the end of the day, he's an animated rabbit you can get behind. Domnhall Gleeson plays the obsessive Mr. Thomas McGregor, who wants nothing to do with the wildlife of the area and may be too complex of a character for a movie like this (this is not a bad thing, it just surprised me that a character who is not presented as all bad or good showed up in a children's comedy). As far as his performance goes, Gleeson is pretty amusing to watch as he balances his fixation on getting rid of the rabbits permanently and hiding those feelings from Bea. Sometimes I heard a little General Hux (his character in the recent Star Wars movies for those unfamiliar) in his voice - I thought in one scene in particular he was about to go on a tirade about how the rebellion will bow down to the First Order. Rose Byrne and her character Bea go underused in the film; she shows up here and there, but the audience doesn't learn much about her other than she does not paint well and is a friend of the rabbits. The movie's ending would have been more dramatic and the audience more connected to the outcome if greater attention had been paid to her character.  The animation of all the critters is not stunning, but certainly good enough to not distract. The humor is primarily slapstick, with traps and chase sequences in the garden galore. There are also a lot of verbal jokes, some more clever than others. Overall the comedy isn't the laugh out loud variety, maybe more of a light chuckle. There are positive themes of family and the beauty of nature for children. Ultimately, Peter Rabbit is not as bad as I expected; I had a reasonably agreeable time watching it. P.S. I'm not interested in weighing in on the infamous allergy scene; the fact that I saw the movie after the controversy arose should say enough about my feelings towards the subject."
"161",3,"  Fans of the Beatrix Potter books may not be happy, but you can't please everyone. I know the rabbits are CGI creations, but they are just too damn ADORABLE to resist! Rose Byrne and Domhnall Gleeson are pretty darn adorable, as well. Sure, the film is overloaded with slapstick comedy and violence, but it's a basket full of fun!"
"162",1.5,"  The movie is not completely horrible; it's just not remotely related to the story of Peter Rabbit. If you are a fan of Beatrix Potter's work, you might want avoid this movie. If you are instead just hoping to see a rather flat movie about a rabbit who is a self-centered jerk, this one will suffice."
"163",3,"  This movie was honestly quite a bit of fun. I was laughing throughout. I found the humor to hit more than miss, for me. I think James Corden did great as Peter Rabbit. I am not familiar with the books, and I bet this isn't a faithful adaptation, so keep that in mind. If that is going to bug you then this movie isn't for you. But as a film itself, I found it to be really fun and its worth checking it out. Kids would love this movie"
"164",2,"  IF YOU ARE READING THIS THEN IT IS PROOF THAT RT IS BLOCKING NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF BLACK PANTHER!!! That being said this movie, Peter Rabbit, suffers from a complete over representation of ""diversity"". It's a shame when a movie based in Europe is filled with non-Europeans. All the Anglo British are represented as rude, stupid, evil, and eccentric while all the Non-native British are represented as noble, wise, and kind."
"165",5,"  Great movie to watch and bring the kids to. Full of funny loving moments"
"166",5,"  I took my 12 year old son to see Peter Rabbit and it was VERY funny! I was laughing louder and harder than some of the kids in the theater but every child and parent left with a huge smile on their faces and wonderful memories!"
"167",4,"  Fun movie with great laughs"
"168",2.5,"  Although not the best version of the classic Peter Rabbit story, Peter Rabbit is still a generally enjoyable film with interesting characters and a fun story."
"169",5,"  Greatest movie of 2018"
"170",5,"  Excellent family movie! Great animation and just enough comedy to keep all ages entertained!"
"171",3,"  Clever, although I feel like most of the humor was for the adults. Definitely a fun movie for the family."
"172",5,"  I loved it and so did my daughter and grandchildren. I'm buying it when it comes out!"
"173",5,"  This movie was funny from start to finish. My entire family hasn't laughed so hard at the movies in years. My ainxty 13 year old loved it! At times, it has some ""home alone"" moments. I'm not sure why, but it was still funny. I'm not sure why the ratings are so low, it was a pleasure."
"174",5,"  Much better than expected. Worth watching with kids!"
"175",5,"  Very funny, clever animations. I would watch this again for the fantastic illustrations."
"176",5,"  Raspberry scene were very funny"
"177",5,"  I loved this movie it was very very very funny even my grandfather was laughing it was one of the best movies I have ever seen!????"
"178",4,"  cute movie, some funny parts"
"179",5,"  Cracks me up that this is so low rated. EXCELLENT version of Peter Rabbit - I liked the artistic license, it wasn't too far - it was well acted, well done digitally - and I loved it, my kids loved it AND my grandchildren, most importantly liked it! Thanks for the acting, the interpretation and making a ""smart"" movie."
"180",5,"  Absolutely hilarious. A modernized classic."
"181",1,"  Terrible movie - keep your kids at home and rent a Pixar film"
"182",4,"  This was a fabulous movie... I hadn't laughed out loud that much in months. Wonderful adult humor, great animation and storyline. I'm sorry some found the allergy portion an issue. We used it as a point of discussion with grandkids afterwards. This was a wonderful couple hours of escape from a gray day. Enjoy!!!"
"183",5,"  One of the funniest and most enjoyable movies I have seen recently."
"184",3,"  Decent movie but the frenetic camera and CGI work was a bit nauseating."
"185",3,"  My 8 year old boy loved it! I liked the moral of the story!!"
"186",3,"  I have to admit that I did not go in expecting to like this mainly due to the fact that I don't like cgi mixed in with real life actors and set. This movie surprised me. The toilet humor that is in so many of these movies was scant (maybe one scene), James Cordon as Peter Rabbit was okay, and while they did throw in current pop songs, they didn't last very long. The main human characters (one of them being Dominic Gleeson of Star Wars fame) did have good chemistry and I wasn't bored watching them together. So many of these Live Action/CGI movies have human characters that are just boring and don't really contribute to the plot enough for it to be non animated. Here I think it works. It's not perfect by any means, but the rabbit characters are all fun and interesting. If you're going for a straight adaptation, you will be disappointed (although original illustrations are featured (with a an actual purpose) as well as some beautiful animation. However, it was good and if all cgi/live actions tried what Peter Rabbit managed to do okay, then I would be more optimistic with these types of films."
"187",5,"  I saw this with my mom and 3 year old nephew. I thought it was a really cute and funny movie. I definitely recommend it."
"188",4,"  My grandson's (age 6 and 8) and I loved this movie! Funny, uplifting film. So glad we saw it."
"189",5,"  perfect 2018 story telling for adults and children alike. Loved it and it is delighting many of our friends. Lighten up, and recognize the moral story in yourselves."
"190",3,"  Ok. Kids liked it. Not much for the grown ups."
"191",1,"  Even Popeye was a better Easter movie than this dreck. I mean who is the target audience? Retarded kids under 10?"
"192",4,"  This one is not deserving the bad reviews. It's a fun romp, like a modern bunny slapstick musical. Loved it, laughed out loud, am picky, but this one is going to please those who understand British Humor. Benny Hill meets Monthy Python in a sweet way."
"193",3,"  Worth a view on bluray."
"194",5,"  Great movie the kids laughed & so did I and I hate cartoons.."
"195",3.5,"  It was 7/10 for me iv'e seen better Anime but not the worst"
"196",5,"  It's great for young kids. However, your 12+ year olds might find it boring. Extremely cute movie though! If you have kids 10 and under, hop to this movie quickly. They'll love it!"
"197",4.5,"  I went to see it with my best friend and we both really enjoyed it! It was sweet and good movie for kids and adults to go see!"
"198",4,"  An interesting take on the classic novel that updates the classic story and stays close to the source material. Domhnall Gleeson, Daisy Ridley, James Corden and Rose Byrne star in this movie that's fun for the whole family."
"199",2,"  This movie unexplainly erected to the point where I dont know where my sexuality is leading! Im no longer a virgein! Thank mr rabbit!"
"200",5,"  Seeing that how good the trailer was, i wanna see this so badly, i think this is #1 on my to-do list, to see this amazing masterpiece, i don't even care if Fifty Shades took Gold, this movie is just a awesome, piece of, masterpiece, too good, i hope this a even more success for Sony Pictures Animation, they took the #1 spot for me, just of how good the story is! and the animation, just, just the best, this is the best artwork i have EVER seen in a movie! this looks like the beginning of sonys best movies ever, but this deserves 1st place."
"201",5,"  hilarious movie, loved it"
"202",3,"  It definitely had some funny bits and the actors were endearing."
"203",4,"  No idea why this rating is so low, if you like Bugs Bunny you will love this. Its awesome."
"204",3,"  It was sometimes funny, a story seen and seen again but in a rabbit version, where a guy suddenly comes into everyone lives and the hero tries to ruin it all.The casting for me was really hard, I don't really like James Corden and hearing him for 1h30 was a pain.It's a nice movie for kids and people who don't want to think a lot, or just to have a nice time at the cinema.The image though is very nice and enjoyable."
"205",0.5,"  Just awful. If you want an animation film, wait until March for Isle Of Dogs"
"206",5,"  Great for kids and adults...timing of humor was impeccable."
"207",4,"  The slapstick didn't always work and some of it was a bit too violent. The heart was very well done. Most of the time these type of CGI animal movies fail, but this one of those rare exceptions that turn out good. Not the best film, but still a great one."
"208",4,"  Though some jokes don't work and some of its best slapstick gets old, it's pretty funny and does have a lot of heart in this film. Wasn't expecting to rate this movie so high, but I generally enjoyed. The pop songs weren't good, only a few worked in the film."
"209",5,"  This movie is HILARIOUS! now it isn't as good as Paddington or Coco but really enjoyed this flim!Now the snowflakes cryimg about the Epi pen scene, I didn't anything offensive about that and thought it was funny as any other scene movies have done in the past.People need to get stop with the PC and being sensitive about everything! I think people just wanna cry-wolf cause they can't whine about anything else! Grow up people!"
"210",2.5,"  Peter Rabbit is a cute but disposable family film that has some appealing animation, heart, and a self-aware sense of humor that pokes fun at several kids' movie clichés, unfortunately the plot is rehashed and suffers from repeated jokes as well as unfunny giggle fests for the little ones, and a soundtrack that doesn't really fit a Beatrix Potter environment!"
"211",5,"  HILARIOUS. for all ages."
"212",0.5,"  This movie deserves zero stars. It is incomprehensible how Sony can joke about a life threatening medical condition, especially in a children's movie. Would they joke about slipping sugar to a diabetic person causing them to go into a diabetic coma and die? This is not about political correctness or parents being snowflakes. Food allergies can and do kill. And an epi-pen does not always stop anaphylaxis. Regardless of the food allergy scene, Beatrix Potter must be turning over in her grave to see her beloved and mischievous Peter Rabbit, turned into a sadistic bully."
"213",1,"  the food allergy scene is so unbelievably out of order. making light of such a serious thing is not ok. my son has several severe food allergies and the thought of someone throwing those allergens at him is terrifying. shame on you Sony."
"214",5,"  ONE OF THE GREATEST KIDS MOVIE!! Goes hand in hand with the book and was hilarious with the .sarcastic humor. Also the animations were absolutely fantastic Love Love Love!!"
"215",3,"  Will there ever be anything Hollywood won't make a movie out of? So far this year, we've had movies based on a song, a minutes-long incident, and now Peter Rabbit, the old children's tale from British author Beatrix Potter. It makes for a companion to Paddington 2, as both are about British animal cartoon characters, only while Paddington 2 is about a friendly bear in London, Peter Rabbit is about a rambunctious rabbit in the countryside.True to the setting, Peter Rabbit has a bright visual design. Vibrant foliage and garden plants litter the film. The countryside setting is itself picturesque (maybe literally, because I'm pretty sure the backgrounds are matte paintings). Bizarrely, that's the most delightful part of this movie. Even though Peter Rabbit is known for being a wholesome family story, the movie adaptation opts to base its style entirely on slapstick comedy. Most of it is too crude or immature to stick, but some gags managed to make me chuckle. Peter himself is characterized as a hard-to-like rogue. As for animation, most of the animals have lifelike CGI, with some exceptions, like a rooster who looks blocky and unfinished.However, Peter Rabbit has one saving grace. While the movie features, narration, training montages, and alternative and hip-hop (get it?) hits like any cliched family film, it utilizes these tropes to display self-awareness. At times, it feels insincere, but it brings a much-needed moral that redeems the otherwise blasphemous slapstick. Peter Rabbit tries to succeed by disregarding the source material and going down a conventional path. Barely, just barely, it pulls it off."
"216",2.5,"  Peter RabbitInitial Reaction: How many Peter Rabbits are there out there?Main Characters Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny: Two rabbits voiced by James Corden and Colin Moody. Bea: She's the next door neighbor. She 's played by Rose Byrne.Plot Summary Peter, his family, and his animal friends are doing their usual routine: Get into McGregor's farm and get as many vegetables as possible. But after a certain rain goes wrong, Peter gets caught by McGregor. But the old guy suffers a fatal heart attack and is whisked away. The animals think they've got their problems solved and have run of the place. However, a distant relative shows up several days later to fix up the place. The new guy, Thomas, turns out to be just as protective as the other McGregor - which really angers Peter Rabbit. However, Thomas' plans take hit a bump when he and Bea take a liking to each other. This makes Peter want Thomas out of the house even more.SCORINGMain Characters Peter and Thomas have some great moments near the end of the film, but there's not much to like about either one of them.  And I don't really like Bea because she's stuck in the typical ""girlfriend/peacekeeper"" character. SCORE: 6Supporting Cast The rest of the animals are okay, but not memorable. There's a hedgehog who acts like and elderly woman, several rabbit sisters arguing who's the oldest and the Peter's best friend who goes anywhere just to help him out. SCORE: 5Plot The film goes a bit overboard with the revenge plot between Peter and Thomas. Then it tries to resolve the problem in a way that's really short and ridiculous. SCORE: 4Originality It's your average family film - with talking animals. Wait, that still makes it your average family film. SCORE: 5Violence Factor A lot of bad things happen to Thomas - he gets electrocuted, has bear traps clamp onto his hands, suffers from huge falls, and so on. And yet, he's not hurt at all. Ridiculous. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film tries to show what happens when a small conflict gets out of control, but the way that conflict is resolved is a bit too fast and tidy.  And they fudge the rule about the animals and humans talking to one another. In several scenes, they can't do that but in a key scene, a human is having a normal conversation with an animal. SCORE: 5Final Score (out of 60): 29 % Score: 48.33% Peter and Thomas needed to be less of jerks then they are, and the main conflict needed to have a better resolution."
"217",0.5,"  Bad Bad Bad and not appropriate for young children. Id give this 0 stars if possible. very disappointing"
"218",3.5,"  ""Peter Rabbit"" (PG, 1:33) is a shocking movie to contemplate. It's shocking to think that it took more than a century for the mischievous bunny of British scientist, illustrator and writer Beatrix Potter's early 20th century children's books to get the big screen treatment. Ah, but it was well worth the wait.In this live-action adaptation, the CGI Peter is voiced by James Corden. He leads his complicit, but more cautious little sisters, Flopsy (Margot Robbie), Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki) and Cottontail (Daisy Ridley), along with their clumsy cousin, Benjamin (Colin Moody), on regular raids into the garden of mean old Mr. McGregor (an unrecognizable Sam Neill). Peter is not just mischievous, he's selfish and reckless, often tempting danger in his pursuit of his ill-gotten vegetables. McGregor is in a constant battle with Peter, but just when it looks like the Old Man may have finally gotten the upper hand, he keels over.The country estate then passes to the meticulous and ambitious London department store supervisor, Thomas McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson). Thomas travels into the country to fix up the place so he can sell it and finance his dream of opening his own toy store. He soon finds himself in his own cat and mouse... er, human and rabbit... game with Peter. Doing her best to protest Peter from Thomas (much as she did with Peter's late great uncle) is next-door neighbor and animal lover Bea (Rose Byrne). As Thomas starts to fall for Bea, their blossoming relationship complicates his attempts to be rid of Peter once and for all. ""Peter Rabbit"" is a fun family film. The battles between the McGregor men and Peter get kind of mean-spirited at times, but the violence is mostly of the cartoon variety. The script by Will Gluck (who also directs) and Zareh Nalbandian is mostly well-written and cleverer than your average anthropomorphic animal tale. The voice cast is very good, Byrne's winning presence naturally enhances enjoyment of the film and the usually serious Gleeson proves surprisingly adept at comedy, especially the physical kind. Peter's personality and imperfections remind me of Surly Squirrel in the ""Nut Job"" movies, but Peter's a little bit sweeter. In the end, despite some uneven storytelling, Peter learns some lessons, as do the main live-action characters, and Movie Fans get a pretty enjoyable hour and a half at the movies. ""B+"""
"219",0.5,"  This mean-spirited ""kid's"" film is a shameful depiction of a childhood classic. Whether your family deals with life-threatening food allergies or not, you will want to skip this waste of time unless you are interested in showing your family a ""how-to"" guide to being a bully. If you don't think kids follow the examples they see - like the sweet little bunny main character here - because ""come on, kids are smarter than that"" then I give you two words: Tide Pods. In this movie, said cute bunny intentional attempts to kill another character by forcing a deadly allergen in his mouth. And it almost works. How is this funny to anyone? Kids with these conditions didn't choose to have to deal with fear with every bite they eat just as much as kids with cancer or autism didn't choose their conditions. Yeah, it's just a movie BUT IT'S A KID'S MOVIE. These stars, producers, directors, studio execs should be totally ashamed of themselves for perpetuating this junk. SKIP THIS FILM."
"220",1,"  Sony has proven themselves again to be the EA of Cinema with this abomination that would cause beatrix potter to roll in her Grave"
"221",4,"  It's a good movie, yes it has a food allergy scene but it's not saying it's ok to to tease or bully someone about it. That's where parenting comes in, stop blaming others and own your parenting. Do they need a disclaimer for every scene in that movie? Harming animals, burglary, destruction of property, breaking and entering... come on it's a movie, educate your children. They've seen worse on TV and the internet and if they haven't they will."
"222",1,"  What a wretched film. I think Peter was supposed to have ""attitude"". If ""attitude"" means being a mean spirited bully then they succeeded. The allergy scene was cringe worthy. Why do I think we will be hearing stories about children with allergies being e endangered for months over that brainless segment."
"223",2.5,"  Cloying and contrived. A little too arch. They didn't delve enough into the animal world and the animal characters came across as cartoons rather than drawing you in. Very pretty animation but the lead cgi characters weren't that interesting and their dialogue was lackluster.The human characters *were* interesting and had a far better story, dialogue, characterization. Domnal Gleason was great fun! Wish he was more the lead rather than the rabbit. Decent enough if you're interested in the property, having read it as a child. Children will probably enjoy the animal characters."
"224",0.5,"  Food allergy bullying is not ok. My child, who has a food allergy, said, ""If I made a mistake and was mean to rabbits, I would not want that to happen to me"" . Sad!"
"225",5,"  Peter Rabbit was very entertaining. Appropriate for both children and adults."
"226",5,"  Excellent movie for all ages. We took our 6 yr old twin grandsons. We all thought the movie was hilarious. Highly recommend this movie for your family. Very cute animals."
"227",5,"  So charming enjoyable for the whole family!"
"228",5,"  The best movie ever do not listen to the critics they are lying about the rating of this movie it is 100% not 58% is one of the best movies of 2018 please do not listen to these critics go see it enjoy laugh your head off it's a great movie not one part is bad"
"229",4.5,"  I loved this movie. With the sensibility of George of the Jungle, this somehow manages to juggle a fun story with as many winks and nods and weird side jokes as possible. It goes the distance and weird ways and doesn't shy away from dark turns and absolute absurdity. I look forward to seeing this movie again."
"230",0.5,"  NO reason to include a food allergy attack that nearly resulted in death in a movie geared toward kids. One in 13 kids has a food allergy. Scary and violent scene."
"231",4.5,"  LOVE...LOVE...LOVE!!! I would look at Beatrix Potter's books for hours on end dreaming up the stories that continued beyond the pictures and the words on each page. This movie took me back to those moments. And to watch the glee on my son's face as he watched Peter Rabbit come to life; surrounded by his rabbit ""family"" that have long listened to the Beatrix Potter books and who have a ""life"" of their own, with mischief much like that of Peter's...well, this movie wins every award in my book! Well done!"
"232",5,"  This was an adorable movie! While it doesn't fully follow the book(s), there are so many points where someone familiar with them will have 'aha' moments. We definitely enjoyed it and very well might see it again!"
"233",5,"  Very good and funny made me laugh and I'm 30"
"234",0.5,"  If I could rate this a zero I would. This movie is disgraceful. -a mother of two children with life threatening food allergies"
"235",1,"  Murder by food allergy is not funny"
"236",0.5,"  Food allergies are not a punchline."
"237",0.5,"  If I could give it zero stars I would. Wholly inappropriate for children. Terrible writing."
"238",4.5,"  Incredibly funny with its moments of heartfelt beauty, Peter Rabbit is visually stunning and is an amazing achievement for Sony."
"239",4,"  It was fun....in a silly way"
"240",4,"  It was filled with witty humor and adult"
"241",4.5,"  People will criticize the crap out of anything. It was cute, fun, and enjoyable! My son and I loved it!"
"242",5,"  This was a fantastic family friendly movie. One of the best kid friendly movies I have seen in a long time. Very engaging and witty and the characters were loveable and fun! For all the SWJ's who were upset about one of the characters using having to use an epi-pen for their allergy, you are being over sensitive and ridiculous. It was nice to watch a movie that didn't have a political message unlike Paddington 2 which was so sappy and over the top I almost gagged."
"243",0.5,"  It is NOT fully to make light of allergies... especially to children. ??????"
"244",4.5,"  Charming and enjoyable. Good cast with amazing animations. As adults, it made for an entertaining and feel good evening."
"245",1,"  My allergic child was terrified to watch someone attacked by their allergen. She almost died from eating her allergen."
"246",0.5,"  In 2018 can you still be so thoughtless to try to cop a cheap laugh on food allergies? Everyone involved with this production should be ashamed."
"247",0.5,"  Yuck movie .making fun of people's life threatening allergies and teaching kids to throw allergy causing food at anaphaltic kids"
"248",4.5,"  Great movie! Didn't expect to enjoy it but my kids wanted to go see it! I was pleasantly surprised! Very funny!"
"249",1,"  I'm digusted you found cheap laughs in calling food allergies fake and trying to kill off a human by attacking him with his food allergy. If you ever watched my beautiful child stop breathing, as I have, I hope it wouldn't be as funny to you. Dangerous message, disappointing execution. I'm very sorry we wasted the money."
"250",5,"  Fun for the whole family! Great writing, James Corden shines!"
"251",3.5,"  the classic book from Britain comes to life on screennot an 100% faithful adaptation but the kids will love it regardlessa cool cast from James Corden to Rose Byrne to Domhall Gleeson to Daisy Ridley to Margot Robbiethe film does have a rocking soundtrack to go with the flawless animal CGIthe movie just suffers with having a made-for-TV vibe and succumbs to the over-Hollywood product with trying to be hip and modernstill, Peter does learn to grow as a character always thinking of having fun with no regard for danger since he lost his parents with the last owner who watched over the garden they sneek into on a daily basiswith the arrival of his relative and their next door neighbor falling in love it threatens their natural ordercan Peter and his family co-exist with this new enemy of the garden?this could have been a TV special instead but the families will still find some enjoyment"
"252",1,"  Horrid. There's a scene where one animal has a deadly food allergy and says blackberries make his throat close up. The other animals, to be mean, start throwing blackberries at him, trying to get them in his mouth so he has an allergic reaction. They succeed and the animal goes into anaphylaxis and has to use his epi pen. How disgusting that they would put this in a kid's movie, not only making fun and light of kids with food allergies (and food allergies that are deadly no less), but it also gives bullies the bright idea to use deadly food to bully a kid with an allergy. Shame on everyone involved in this movie. I can't believe not a single person said ""wait, this isn't a good idea""."
"253",5,"  THIS IS THE BEST SONY MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!"
"254",3.5,"  My whole family really enjoyed Peter Rabbit. We loved the music- the parodies alone were worth the price of admission! We loved the acting and voice acting! James Corden was so great as Peter Rabbit. And we loved the laughter most of all! A fun comedy! Check out blogs and reviews to figure out if it is right for your kids. There was definitely some rude/bathroom humor- but it was not too heavy. A lot of the adult humor was very tactfully hidden. You do not need to take kids with you to laugh in this movie! It's a cute, comedy adventure! Good for the whole family! Check out our review and discussion guide at DownTheHobbitHoleBlog!"
"255",0.5,"  This movie had the potential to be spectacular. It has tender, charming moments worthy of Beatrix Potter's characters. BUT the over the top sadistic nature of Peter had me uncomfortable for much of the movie. I am sorry I took my kids, and I feel like someone owes Peter Rabbit fans an apology."
"256",5,"  Loved it! I thought it was a ton of fun, full of laughs, and pulled at the heart strings at just the right moments. Very clever and great tunes as well! Highly Recommend!"
"257",2.5,"  There's nothing wrong with a kids flick, is there? Kids like images, and they can easily be entertained. There are many examples of movies that have been released for kids, especially those from Disney, that have appealed to kids and have found great success. And then there's ""Peter Rabbit"", an adaptation of the stories by Beatrix Potter, that sort of misses the mark when it comes to making a movie for kids. While the film itself isn't terrible by all means, it does suffer quire a bit. More so in favor of the movie's direction than anything else. ""Peter Rabbit"" may be a kids movie, but it seems as if it is caught in its own trap of familiarity.The story follows the titular Peter Rabbit (James Corden), who, along with his siblings Cottontail (Daisy Ridley), Flopsy (Margot Robbie), and Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki), and his cousin Benjamin (Matt Lucas), steal vegetables from a nearby garden. But the garden belongs to Old Man McGregor (Sam Neil) who hates rabbits with a passion. One day, McGregor suddenly dies, and an heir named Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) is not too happy with Peter and his clan. Now, Peter must use his wits to get rid of Thomas so that the garden will be free, and their neighbor Bea (Rose Byrne) can accept either Peter or Thomas for affection.""Peter Rabbit"" offers up nothing new or exciting from previous kids films that make this film interesting. Going off the deep end, the major problem with this movie is with the pacing. The movie flows at an incredible pace, not allowing the viewer to slow down and take things in. This, in turn, can be attributed towards the camera; it moves rather fast, and all of the cuts in the movie make the viewer question what just happened.Throughout the entire production, we have a combination of both live action and animation; the animation provided by Sony Pictures Animation, which feels weak when compared to their previous features. Going right into the main flaw, the animation looks very realistic, and could have represented the actual drawings from the books that the main character comes from. Speaking of, there is a little section at the beginning of the film where we get to see the backstory of Peter, told through hand drawn animation, which is represented beautifully. Had the production used the art that was here on their key central characters, then the movie would have been fine to look at.The major problem with the film as a whole, is with the story itself. As one watches the film, they can find where the first, second, and third act is located. As well as many moments that do not make sense, and knowing where the film will be headed. ""Peter Rabbit"" has predictability written all over it.With that being said, there are one or two things that the film does manage to pull off. First, the cast does do a good job, despite the material they are given; all of the actors are given an over-the-top performance, but not too heavily. The one thing that does make the movie stand out is the cinematography. Everything from the landscapes to the sets, the movie more than makes up for it.But all of this doesn't excuse ""Peter Rabbit"" a standard by the books kids film.In conclusion, ""Peter Rabbit"" tries to be a good kids film, but ends up hopping away with its own mistakes."
"258",0.5,"  Not seeing this. Peter promoting food allergy bullying where the victim needs to use epinephrine is irresponsible in normalizing food allergy bullying. Food allergy bullying is already a problem for kids today, why promote it? The movie didn't need this scene to make the movie. Meh, I'll pass. Paddington 2 sounds like a more positive, fun movie to me."
"259",0.5,"  How dare the folks creating and producing children's entertainment that normalizes brutality to those with a food allergy? Why does this film include a scene where the identified character with a life-threatening food allergy and is targeted to die by others ""shooting"" that allergic food into the mouth of the allergic character? This is a hideous message for all children, let alone the very young who struggle to understand how they fit into society where they might be killed by accidentally eating the wrong thing, but now, they might also be intentionally killed by a bully? The entertainment industry needs to have a food allergy ""Time's Up"" moment, as well. Especially when it comes to the messages we are bombarding our children with. It is absolutely wrong to normalize bullying a child with a life-threatening health condition they neither asked for, nor wanted, but will have to spend the rest of their life trying to deal with. To include narratives where bullies go after those with an anaphylactic allergy just for laughs is nothing short of sociopathic. Writers, producers, directors, comedians should raise the bar when it comes to food allergies, because making fun of someone, usually a child, who can die from, say eating a peanut, is the same kind of cruel humor we longer tolerate anywhere else because it's just plain wrong. Didn't Punch and Judy in the Victorian age do comedy where ""the baby"" was constantly killed? Why isn't that done now? Well, because it's a crappy message, frankly, and targeting kids with life-threatening food allergies is the same thing. Stop using children's entertainment to normalize any bullying. Especially toward children who suffer great depression and enormous anxiety, and loneliness about the dangers of their allergy. When I was very young my mother took me to the Lake District to go see where Beatrix Potter lived. We owned every copy in print of her lovely, gentle, sweet books (Tales). I find it tragic that almost everything her work was about is being hacked and twisted into some angry, sociopathic war movie with messages of bullying and harm and anger being the driving force of the film. Not sure which writer came up with a film with hostility toward Potter as it's core engine, but it should appeal to those who don't care a bit about raising healthy children."
"260",1,"  This movie basically let's children know it's okay to bully and taunt someone with life threatening allergies. Is this want we want to teach our kids?"
"261",4,"  It is a movie for kids, but I thought it was pretty fun!"
"262",0.5,"  Makes me SICK to see a movie company make light of people with life threatening food allergies! You should be ashamed of yourself for doing so!"
"263",5,"  Entertaining in many ways."
"264",2.5,"  The film is amazing with its comedic ways but lacks in plot.5/10"
"265",0.5,"  Trying to get back at someone by exploiting their food allergy? What a terrifying, disgusting and irresponsible notion to perpetuate."
"266",5,"  Very cute and very funny a must see with the kiddos!!"
"267",5,"  i luved it was so amazing u should watch it!"
"268",3.5,"  I am looking forward to this movie, the trailers look fun and I have become a Domhnall Gleason fan so this will be interesting. I will update with a proper review after I see it. Needless to say, I am certain it will be better (much better) than The Last Jedi. UPDATE: Plan to see it soon, as of this writing critics are rotten at 57% and audience is fresh at 77% -- unbelievable how wrong the critics are in most all cases, so I am expecting a pretty good movie now.My Take ....Ok, saw this movie and really enjoyed it. I was more than right, I was spot on. This film is 10X better than that abomination called The Last Jedi. This movie had everything that The Last Jedi did not. A strong plot, good character development, an intriguing story, and plenty of fun to go around. The jokes were expected and did not fall flat, there were no glaring plot holes and the film did a nice job of extending continuity to the source material (though I would not begrudge a person not liking this movie because it does not present the characters in a such a way as the source material did). It was fun, it was consistent, the tone was proper and the message was clear. I would definitely recommend this a good family night out with kids in the 6-12 range."
"269",5,"  This is a very clever and hilarious movie that I highly recommend to people of all ages. Bob Fitzpatrick and I went to see it tonight, and since we were at the 6:45 show, there were a lot of children in the audience. If you want to laugh with abandon at all the scenes, including the ones that involve butts and vegetable hits to the groin area, try to see it when younger kids will be in the theater so you can hide your own guffaws in their cackling. But even if you don't have the good fortune to see it with a load of children, there is plenty of less embarrassing stuff to laugh about, too.The plot is inane, but it's a good enough vehicle to provide a ton of great visual jokes. The dialogue is fast and smart, and like the best Disney movies, has the possibility of multiple layers of understanding. Everyone will be laughing, although what's funny about it will differ, even for the same lines sometimes. The live action characters in this do a very entertaining job and the animated characters' voices are perfect. There is quite a bit of good music in this movie, and some really cute dancing by the animated characters. I don't feel I'm doing this fun movie critical justice, so I'll just close this out by urging you to go. It's 95 minutes long and I swear you will leave smiling."
"270",5,"  The movie was adorable and funny. Nicely done!"
"271",4,"  Maybe it's because I saw it in a theater full of kids and families, but I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the classic tale. Very cute with a serious layer of effective slapstick humor, I legitimately laughed out loud several times. The casting and voice talent was well done. I highly recommend taking the kids to this one."
"272",2,"  To be fair, I went into this film with blinders on. Despite my trepidation at this being a Sony Pictures release (the same studio that botched both the Chipmunks and Smurfs franchises multiple times), I was still riding the high of Paddington 2 and was looking forward to another film that would put a loving yet fresh spin on a classic British children's character. BOY, was I disappointed! So much crass, juvenile humor, poorly written characters, and disturbing changes from the original source material( certain characters are deceased that weren't in the original books and cartoons, the animals turning the manor into a frat house, etc.). Growing up with the TIMELESS BBC Beatrix Potter collection, it was very hard to see such an integral piece of my childhood being used for a cynical down season cash grab. I wouldn't even take young children to it. Show them the BBC version instead, it's far more interesting and takes its time with the characters (ironic for a 30 minute special vs. a two hour film), and the art style (which they shamelessly incorporated at parts here too) is a wonder to behold. SAD!"
"273",3,"  An enjoyable family friendly ride. I enjoyed myself while watching this movie but the families in the audience seemed to of had more fun. There were some good laughs in this movie but there are also a few throw away ""fall down and get hurt"" jokes that were obviously meant for children. Overall it was a cute movie but no need to watch again unless occompanied by a child. I'd recommend for a family for sure, other than that don't rush to watch it but keep an eye out for it on a lazy Sunday afternoon"
"274",5,"  We loved this movie! A perfect movie for children and adults."
"275",4,"  Well done... funny... my son and I loved it."
"276",1,"  I never asked for this."
"277",1,"  Peter Rabbit is the latest in a long line of kids movies based on dignified and beloved works of children's fiction that replaces the dignity with shrill, unfunny modernity. Peter Rabbit takes Beatrix Potter's lovely rabbit stories and wipes it's furry feet on them with a terrible pop soundtrack and sub-Home Alone style gags so jarringly violent you begin to wonder if they belong in a kid's flick. https://geeks.media/movie-review-peter-rabbit?_ga=2.200374190.1417020870.1515348633-953607229.1513947710"
"278",0.5,"  This film is a disgrace to the wonderful masterpiece of a book by Beatrix Potter. How did this get decent reviews from critics so far? Makes me worry about the future state of humanity...F, 0/10"

"1",5,"  It is a amazing film it has inspired me to come put and tell my peronts that i am gay. It is the nest film that i have seen in a long time."
"2",4,"  A great coming of age story focusing on a gay teen, that shows the struggles of being in the closet and coming out to friends and family in a great way. I love the LGBT representation in this and the movie itself is a great mix of funny and emotional. Definitely recommend seeing it!"
"3",4.5,"  This movie was nice without being overly saccharine. Hufflepuff-esque one might say. Hitting all the right notes, Love, Simon showcases an accurate interpretation of a young gay adolescent; from the way that Simon's attention quickly jumps from potential suitor to potential suitor or his aptly decorated room and penchant for Panic! At The Disco.However, this movie's lack of.. anything, lack of advertising and lack of flair, leaves it stuck in the middle with little development of the characters. The characters, while relatable and each woven easily into the narrative are almost two dimensional, flat and limp on the screen. This two dimensionality of the characters fortunately, does not take away from the general enjoyment of the film and the director seemed to be striving for a film about the average and has achieved his goal.My one wish for this film? More screen time for the main love interest. Spoiler alert. Bram, who turns out to be Blue lacks dialogue or any meaningful connection with Simon. It is heavily implied that they have spent time together off screen but apart from a drunken montage together, they barely see each other.In conclusion, great movie but not the one to watch if you're looking for depth and meaning and metaphors. Enjoyable, light hearted but still touching on serious issues. A must see for any LGBT+ teen.Kudos to Greg Berlanti for adding just a touch more diversity to Hollywood's white washed, overplayed, heterosexual rom-com scene."
"4",5,"  A very nice movie indeed. Made me feel ""Gay""! Yay!"
"5",4,"  Really good. Saw it with my husband (and without our teenage daughter) and we both liked it quite a bit. I'm a sucker for a good ending."
"6",5,"  Love, Simon is just what has been needed for awhile now and it does what other movies in this genre hasn't really been able to achieve. It's a feel good movie that will make you laugh, cry, and make you leave the theater feeling there's some good in the world. And who wouldn't want Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Gardner as your mom and dad?"
"7",4,"  Great all around movie"
"8",5,"  Love, Simon is one of the best movies i've ever seen. Like Simon inspires Blue, their story inspired me. Everybody deserves a great love story."
"9",5,"  Amazing, great plot great pace, made me laugh and and cry and leave feeling good"
"10",5,"  If you don't like this movie, it's most likely because you're straight"
"11",5,"  Best movie I have ever seen!! It gets the message sent without Shoving it in your face! It doesn't try to be an incredible movie yet still is! Incredible cast and characters! Highly recommend!"
"12",5,"  I loved this film so much. I could relate to it on many levels as an openly gay teen. My coming out is still happening 5 years after my big 'outing' and this movie has brought up so many emotions I didn't think I'd have to face again. Anger, sadness and joy. These emotions being produced by this film shows to all that the representation of the LGBT community is not only there but very nearly perfect. Thankyou cast and producers for this truly wonderful film."
"13",5,"  best movie I have ever seen. i never realized how little i related to couples on screen untill simon kissed Blue and I, and the ENTIRE theater erupted in screaming and clapping and tears. this is the most I have ever trully FELT a movie and its just so important."
"14",5,"  Amazing movie and very relatable"
"15",5,"  O filme È perfeito, simples, nada extraordin√°rio mas consegue fazer o p√∫blico se identificar totalmente com Simon."
"16",2.5,"  This movie was alright...."
"17",5,"  Amazing, funny , emotional. The best film I've seen all year . Possibly an all time favourite."
"18",5,"  This film is amazing. The story is so important in todays society, it is one that needs to be portrayed to a mass audience and thankfully it has, lets hope that audiences give back and go and see it. It's got hilarious moments, touching moments, moments you want to shout out at the screen, moments that make you cry, and most importantly, moments that make you think. Maybe I am biased as someone who is a gay teen, but I feel like this film has something for everybody, whilst giving such an important voice the LGBTQ community. One of the best films I have ever seen."
"19",5,"  This movie was freaking amazing, it was perfect in every aspect! I loved the development of characters, the suspense in some parts, and just the overall romantic aspect of it. It was so beautiful and I hope there is a sequel as the director teased. Love, Simon is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time!!!!"
"20",5,"  This made me cry so many times. It truly is beautiful."
"21",5,"  A fantastic, happy coming-of-age LGBT movie that I think teens today deserve. It's not about the hard, scary struggle that many can relate to, but it's the romcom with representation that I wish I could have had when I was young. Well written, AMAZINGLY acted, and genuine throughout."
"22",5,"  Best movie I've seen this year, not close. Start to finish i was into the film. Great message and just an overall awesome film."
"23",3.5,"  A sweet coming out story that normalizes being gay, however, hits some standard beats in the coming-of-age genre and occasionally forces sentimentality upon its subjects. The representation and joy the film depicts makes up for its overall lack of nuance. Let there be more pictures like Love, Simon, and hopefully in the future, add some subtlety. What we have now, though is a film that could ease the pain of many teenagers and those who see themselves in Simon's plight, and help them accept who they are. Rating: 71"
"24",5,"  So far my favourite movie ever. Robinson was absolutely stunning as were Langford, Shipp, Garner and Duhamel. Katherine Langford has come to be my favourite actress in the current moment and her portrayal as Simon's best friend Leah was amazing. The script was very well done and quite tight as well. The directing was great and overall loved it. 10/10, would recommend."
"25",5,"  Love, Simon was a very well directed movie. It was a heart-warming film that showed the true struggle of coming out and being gay. This is well composed, and is a lovely representation of how unfair gay lives are. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would definitely do so. A big thank you to the producers of this amazing movie."
"26",3.5,"  A fun and refreshing take on the coming-of-age tale. A great introduction into a topic that isn't addressed enough and that is done in a fun and safe way. 'Love, Simon' will make you smile."
"27",3.5,"  Simon is a sociable and normal looking 17-year-old, he has a close-knit group of friends at school, a loving and liberal-minded family at home, but he is carrying a huge burden on his young shoulders. Not that he hasn?t told anyone he is gay and is corresponding anonymously online with another closeted school mate but that he?s a lead character in a studio picture who happens to be gay. One can only imagine the expectations and what will happen if this film does not perform. Thankfully, we have a smart and breezy script that normalizes the coming out process and treats it as just another adolescent experience like having your first kiss, or discovering one?s sexuality, whether it is straight, gay or otherwise undefined. Less rom-com but more a coming of age drama with an element of romantic mystery as Simon tries to find out the secret identity of the person he is sharing his most personal inner feelings with, this is an extremely likeable film with an equally likeable lead. Greg Berlanti?s direction is solid and he steers the film away from either being too heavy or too twee. For the most part, the script feels real and believable, with more than a few good zingers spread around for maximum comedic effect. The cast is good-looking and charming/inoffensive enough to appeal to an audience outside the niche queer cinema crowd. Mission accomplished then? Probably, but the coming out of mainstream Hollywood Cinema is only beginning and hopefully the positive critical response and box office will mean that we can have more enjoyable LGBTQ+ films that doesn?t have to be serious (Moonlight), arty (Call Me By Your Name) or tragic (Brokeback Mountain) in order to get noticed or seen."
"28",5,"  These days it isn't often that I watch a movie that truly touched my soul. Love, Simon is the kind of film that's funny, sensitive, brave and above all else hopeful. It's the kind of film you want to watch again straight after the credits roll. Every character had an important role to play. The parents, the teachers, the peers, they are all necessary in telling this story, which more than anything is a love story. I'm calling it right now this is the best film of the year and I'll even go as far as saying it's now in my top 5 favourite movies of all time. If you only watch one movie this year let it be this one. I promise you won't regret it."
"29",2.5,"  I really enjoy the movie, especially the first part. But I don't know why, I felt disconnected with the second part... I have no prejudice and I loved ""Call me by your name"". But here, something is still missing... It's a very good movie, just not a great one!"
"30",3.5,"  It is more of a teenage movie instead of a gay one. Most of the audience in my session were teenage girls. I guess most of gay teenage boys were still in the deep closet. The setting of the whole movie is way too ideal including understanding and progressive parents, loyal friends, responsible and caring teachers, friendly schoolmates and a good-looking masculine Caucasian main character from an upper middle-class family. In addition, I would be curious aout what would happen if mysterious Mr. Blue were an average-looking chubby Asian guy. Would the fina kiss be able to happen as well? Anyway, it is a good movie but definitely not on the same level with 'Call Me by Your Name'."
"31",5,"  Amazing movie and relates with my own history."
"32",3.5,"  Solid balance of humor contrasts nicely with some of the heavier elements. Provides a fresher approach to what many will recognize as a well worn genre."
"33",4,"  A great teen movie that is enjoyable for older audiences. Well written and acted."
"34",5,"  I knew this was gonna be a tear jerker to some extent, and definitely was. It is sweet, funny, sad, and heart wrenching. This is a movie I will be purchasing so that i can watch it over and over."
"35",4,"  First off, I loved this movie. As an LGBTQ+ teen, many aspects really hit home. Dealing with your sexuality an gender can be really difficult. Yes, this movie is cliche. Yes, this movie is made for teens. But the thing is is that it's good at these things. You don't see too many movies that can pull off having stereotypical elements while having them be impactful. Although the movie does involve many elements of inclusion, there could have been steps that could have been made to make it more inclusive. One of them is having an LGBTQ+ actor in the main role. Another is (spoiler) not making the Friend of color have all of the family problems. ANOTHER is not having the main character be in a rich white suburb with a steady life and progressive parents. This is basically if everything had gone right for anybody. Now let's get into it. Being outed sucks. Many non-LGBTQ+ people look over that aspect of the movie, but it's one of the largest fears of many in the community. I was outed by my mom to my dad. It sucked. I wasn't ready. Of course, that wasn't the same scale as in the movie, so I can only imagine how Simon felt. Many non-LGBTQ+ people loved this movie, which is good, but many will never understand how it truly feels. Overall Love, Simon was an amazing movie even if it didn't deal with everything in the way it should have"
"36",5,"  If you want to see how coming out is a shitty process, this film shows how it actually is. Humor-filled, the drama is just okay. The flow of the film is awesome. Well-deserved for an applause after!"
"37",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing. The camera movement, set design, lighting, and filter of the set were perfectly set. Each shot that was taken of the characters- more specifically Simon- captured not only his outer emotions, but his inner emotions as well. As for the plot, it was absolutely fantastic. Even in 2018, an LGBT movie was well needed for teenagers. This movie has brought a lot of confidence upon many many teens throughout not only America, but the entire world. It is a must-have-to-see movie."
"38",5,"  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Many LGBT love stories are tradgedies that can damage young LGBT people's views of being LGBT and out. Young people shouldn't be afraid of being gay. The truth is that the life of an LGBT person isn't tragic and that we, like Simon, are just like you."
"39",5,"  Truly an amazing movie that sent me on an emotional rollercoaster. Was laughing one moment and crying the next. Beautiful concept that was pull off greatly. As a teenager, It's great to see the movie industry coming out (no pu intended) with more diverse films, especially including the LGBT community. Would recommend everyone to watch and will definitely be seeing again."
"40",5,"  Made in a way that makes this a family movie. Wonderfully done!"
"41",5,"  Great movie! Adorable love story and a nice experience for the whole family. It was great for mine :)"
"42",4.5,"  A relatable story that has been waiting to be shared. Although coming out may be easy for Simon compared to others this is a story about owning your own identity in your own way and time."
"43",5,"  This is honestly the best movie I've ever seen."
"44",4.5,"  A fun, yet moving, coming of age tale."
"45",5,"  I loved it so much I balled my eyes out and wish that it was around when I came out."
"46",5,"  This movie holds such a special place in my heart. I, being gay, was gery excited about this movie, and I was not dissapointed in the slightest. The movie captures the feelings of both coming out and being outed so well, and I couldn't help but audibly sob multiple time in the theater. The romance was spot on and lived up to it's source. Highly recommend!"
"47",5,"  i wish i could give this movie a higher rating that it deserves"
"48",5,"  Truly one of the best films I've seen ever. Beautiful story line."
"49",5,"  Watch it. Go see it with your partner, go see it with your kids, go see it with your friends, go see it by yourself. Just go see it."
"50",4,"  A really fun and interesting film.The acting, especially from the main characters, is good. The film has a good message about being open. The only complaint is that the writing is terrible at some parts of the film. People talk not like people. Overall, it was enjoyable. 8/10"
"51",5,"  Very enjoyable love story."
"52",5,"  I couldn't help but smile during pretty much the whole movie."
"53",5,"  A fantastic film built for the modern age. It inspires all generations to be proud of who they are and accept themselves. It also communicates strong positive messages and ideas."
"54",5,"  My queer heart cried itself out several times, and I never really cry. I related so much to Simon and his struggles in coming out and self-acceptance. I never realized how much I needed a gay romcom until I saw this, and this is maybe the only romcom I'll ever watch. SO GOOD."
"55",5,"  It is a movie where we can feel the way of a each persons who can say anything about how they feeling and express theyselfs."
"56",4.5,"  It does everything it set out to do. Top acting and soundtrack gives it some rewatchability if you like crying."
"57",4.5,"  Love, Simon is the coming of age film for this generation. Great performances, with a good script and some funny dialogue . While the film is not perfect and it definitely uses some clichÈ rom-com techniques, it is a film that will change lives. Its worth getting to the cinema for this one."
"58",5,"  Absolutely one of my favorite films by far. Not much can make me shed a tear, but this movie has accomplished that. It's moreover due to the fact that it is a relatable source of raw feelings and emtion for those in the LGBTQ community."
"59",5,"  Such a great movie. Loved every minute of it and was very emotional!"
"60",4.5,"  so far the best movie I've seen in 2018."
"61",4,"  Very fun and cute film.There are two sides to this move. There is the story of a kids coming to terms with himself and the there is a story of teenage friendship. I'm a sucker for teen/coming of age film. This film felt very much like a modern-day Brat Pack or movie from the Not Another Teen Movie era. Even aside from the ""gay side"" it was a very cute story about high school life. There is a bit of a mystery to it too, which was cute. It's very touching. Highly recommend if you're not a trump-loving homophobe."
"62",5,"  Wonderful, moving, sad, funny, happy and likely a fairly accurate portrayal in many ways. One of the best films in a long time."
"63",5,"  Made my gay heart beat fastert"
"64",5,"  Incredible, highly reccomend. The movie was the perfect mix of heart wrenching and hilarious. Very much needed for the LGBTQA+ community."
"65",4.5,"  ""Love, Simon"" is a sweet, overdue addition to that old Hollywood warhorse, the teen coming-of-age movie. The twist, such as it is, is that the lead character (played wonderfully by Nick Robinson) is gay and in equal parts eager and terrified to tell anyone about it. The parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) are what every gay teen's parents should be (but aren't). The only other adults in the story are the vice principal (Tony Hale, always fun) and a drama teacher (Natasha Rothwell, refreshing). But this is a story about teenagers and, appropriately, they are front in center. The actors portraying the teens are uniformly excellent, especially Robinson and Logan Miller (playing a jerk who is a romantic but mostly a jerk). Maybe (hopefully) we'll reach a point some day where this film looks quaint and dated. That day has not yet come. ""Love, Simon"" may not be the greatest film ever made, but it's a strong and necessary one."
"66",5,"  I love this movie so much!! It genuinely gives the feeling of what it's like to be closeted in a potentially hostile environment and not knowing whether you can come out or not."
"67",5,"  Was a beautiful movie. It didn't feel fake or over sexualized just a honest love story that young lgbtq+ teens and adults need to see and be proud of."
"68",5,"  Bless this movie. I've never cried so hard it laughed so much in recent memory. I can't wait to see it again..."
"69",5,"  This film answers the question: what would it look like if John Hughes made a teen film about coming out of the closet and finding love with the same-sex? ""Love, Simon"" harkens back to the days of the 80's teen comedy with its quirkily charming characters and a firm grasp of its time featuring plot points teenagers of the day will recognize as part of their everyday lives such as the usage of social media. With that in mind, its inspiration is clear, but it also boasts an interesting story audiences of all demographics can love and relate to as well as a stellar cast of newcomers to watch our for. Overall, ""Love, Simon"" is a triumph in making LGBT storylines like this not only more available, but also more relatable to younger audiences."
"70",4.5,"  Art is powerful. Good Art allows you to walk in another's shoes. This movie is Good Art and it's message allowed me to walk in Simon's shoes."
"71",5,"  Loved it...what a beautiful movie"
"72",5,"  Today, I watched ""Love, Simon."" I have never, ever wrote any review like this before, but the movie compels me to go this far.Before I say anything else, I am gay, and I watched the film with my best friend (female). The movie sets you up for a whirlwind of emotions, to describe it differently than the exact image it gives you in the beginning. I smiled; I laughed; I cried. ""Love, Simon"" spoke to me on multiple emotional and personal levels. I mean, wow. Just wow. And to have my best friend with me too is just priceless. Absolutely priceless.The movie itself is filled to the brim with relatable moments, sudden twists, situational irony, constant mystery, and loveable, loveable characters. I could not find any wrong with the movie, nor will I dare to attempt to.The theatre will be sure to laugh, gasp, shout, and weep with you. Some folks like me ought to be a tad bit louder. As shy as I am though, I was fine to show my extra love for ""Love, Simon"" through stifled giggles and sniffles (thus resulting in the occasional snort).""Love, Simon"" is for everybody. It exposes so many truths about what such a situation is, and it has many more themes ribboned in with the storyline. From friends, to love, to parents, to school, to introverts, to stress, to awkwardness, and to more and more, ""Love, Simon"" accurately portrays so many ""that's me"" moments.I give my greatest thanks and appreciation to the author of ""Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda"" (which I broke my rule with, by not reading the book first), the cast, and the entire crew who made this possible.Thank you ""Love, Simon"" for making my day. Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for bonding my friend and I (even more). And thank you for giving me solace with who I am. As said before, I am gay. And now, typing it like this gives me tingles from the movie."
"73",5,"  IT'S BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE AND IS SO WORTH WATCHING.This movie will make you feel so emotional and I can so relate to it. It's just so adorable and it's so well crafted. I love it :)"
"74",5,"  I cried WAY TOO much in this movie. Its gr8 m8 I r8 8/8"
"75",4.5,"  This is an adorable, hilarious, and emotional movie about a closeted gay kid who sees a post from an <3 anonymous other closeted kay kid at his same school <3 and they start emailing, anonymously, each other about their lives. This film is near perfect with its wonderful characters, stunning soundtrack, and John Hughes style direction. Warning: it takes you through a roller coaster of feelings."
"76",5,"  This movie is amazing from beginning to end. It's a super relatable movie ??"
"77",5,"  It was so good! It covered everything beautifully. It was hilarious, and the characters were lovable."
"78",0.5,"  Being gay is a trendy popular thing to do right now, almost like getting a tattoo. This movie is another attempt to normalize gay relationships. Help me!"
"79",0.5,"  I felt so misled by the glowing reviews I've read thus far. This was the cheesiest crap I've seen in a long time. It was Disney or ABC Family level."
"80",5,"  Such a great movie. Favorite movie of all time."
"81",5,"  I was laughing, clapping, and cheering the whole time!"
"82",5,"  The world needed a movie like this now. Great storyline where people can relate to Simon's experience. Beautiful film all around with great actors. Bravo"
"83",5,"  This movie means so much. My review would be too long, but suffice it to say I cried several times and I'm immediately saw it again the next day with my partner. Truly amazing."
"84",5,"  Great movie. It had a great pace and kept me guessing. On top of both of those, it was emotionally moving without becoming clichÈ."
"85",5,"  Todays experience with watching the movie ""Love?Simon"" was so heart touching. It talked about a closeted guy who came out of closet in high school. This was the first movie to make me cry that much?because I can deeply feel all the difficulties the main character had gone through and how hard it is to live with it and be open about it. Thanks for making this movie Fox Studio?????"
"86",5,"  I cried for the last 20 minutes. What a heartwarming film! It was great to see Generation Z up on the screen. Their tech and nerd references XD very funny and entertaining. It was easy to identify with the characters even if you've never been in their situations. Good coming-of-age story."
"87",5,"  This movie was absolutely beautiful and inspiring I saw this movie today and I kid you not, it made me cry 5 times and makes me feel accepted as a lesbian."
"88",5,"  This movie is sweet, funny, and beautiful. It's the first of it's genre to perfectly capture what it's like to be a closeted gay teen. Gay teens of the modern world have been waiting for like this. Bravo to the creative team."
"89",5,"  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! I've never seen a movie this good in forever. I cried I laughed and I feel in love with this story. Thank you to the creators!"
"90",5,"  its honestly my favorite movie some parts were a little unbelievable but its a high school Rom com so what do you expect"
"91",5,"  So many actors buying out theatres in small and large cities to open it to the public. Best coming of age which happens to be coming out film, loved the coming out as straight scenes, Very funny! I laughed! Rare in a modern comedy."
"92",0.5,"  Waste of time and money! A huge flop! Sorry, but the story line is predictable and boring!"
"93",5,"  Emotionally powerful, likable characters, accurate and inoffensive portrayal of gays. Go watch this movie oh my god"
"94",5,"  Has all of the ELements of a great movie. deals with contemporary issues in a sensitive manner, tied together with comedy, seriousness, and self introspection."
"95",5,"  What an amazing was to introduce a rom com but in the perspective of a closeted young man. So glad we have this movie now."
"96",2.5,"  A noble purpose, but still just a teen love movie about a straight boy (who happens to like other boys?)"
"97",5,"  If John Hughes had made a film with a gay lead character, this would be it. Love, Simon is funny, touching, with all you expect in a coming of age film. Simon Spier is gay, but no one knows. How he navigates his feelings, and deals with all a high schooler deals with is amazing. I can't speak highly enough about this film."
"98",4.5,"  love it so much, the book is great and so is the movie in a separate way."
"99",0.5,"  I saw this film based on the strong critic and audience ratings. For me, it fell flat and I came close to walking out. There was no depth or heart in the story or the characters, even though they tried."
"100",4.5,"  Even though Love, Simon was a bit corny at times, it was a good coming of age movie, and was the first I have ever seen to tell the story in the perspective of someone who is struggling to come out in High School. I feel like it was more relatable than most movies that try to discuss the topic of sexual orientation in society because it doesn't rely on that discussion as it's only element of storytelling. In other words, for this type of teenage romantic comedy, it doesn't make it seem abnormal for the plot to focus around someone who is gay. The score by Rob Simonsen was also very fitting and the special sound he brought made the movie even more enjoyable to watch."
"101",5,"  One of the best (and most accurate) gay reprisentations in movies nowdays. Must see for anyone questioning themselves. (Must see for everyone honestly)"
"102",4,"  tHE FACT IT EXISTS -A TEENAGE GAY ROMANTIC COMEDY RELEASE D WIDELY BY A MAJOR STUDIO=- IS HISTORICAL. bUT IT IS ALSO A LIGHTHEARTED (MOST OF THE TIME) JOYFUL, THOUGHFUL, FUNNY AND TOUCHING COMING OUT/FIRST LOVE STORY THAT WILL MAKE YOU SMILE WHEN YOU WALK OUT. some CALL IT SLIGHT AND IT MAY BE BUT NOT EVERY GAY FILM HAS TO BE bROKEBACK mtn OR mOONLIHGT (BOTH GREAT FILMS JUST IN DIFFERENT WAYS)."
"103",4.5,"  One of the best movies ive ever seen but not a movie for kids"
"104",5,"  AMAZING MOVIE. LOVED IT! SO GAY"
"105",5,"  This is a movie is really enjoyable and has themes anyone can relate to. I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a classic over the years to come."
"106",4,"  with Hollywood obsessed with hot girls making out, it was refreshing to see the movie about a gay guy, since most of the gay community is male."
"107",4.5,"  Loved it! So sweet and heartwarming look at the realities and struggle of being gay and comjng out."
"108",5,"  Clever, funny, and heart-warming. You're rooting for him the entire time and it provides a compelling journey through teenage friendship, love, and identity."
"109",3,"  It is an OK movie. The acting is good, the characters are well developed but the lack of conflict made the film a boring experience. I couldn't relate to any character and I found the plot unbelievable when in the 21th century is easy to come out the closet. It's another soft gay movie in a happy country called United States."
"110",5,"  This is wonderully beautiful film packed with comical sarcasm, teen angst, and love. I laughed and cried from the very first scene. However, it perpetuates an ideal lifestyle that is just not seen for LGBTQ+ youth. All in all, I loved the movie and would pay to see if another 10 times!"
"111",5,"  This is a movie with the type of characters I want to write. Every character in it is dynamic, intelligently written, and feels REAL. It's the type of movie you'll identify with, no matter how you identify. Simon is the person in us trying to be our true selves, Simon's family is the family we all want, and his friends are the friends we all want to be. If ""Love, Simon"" says anything, it says that this film features the type of people we all should strive to be. Just like real life, this movie isn't about who you love, but how you love."
"112",5,"  So amazing. Great performances, funny dialogue and a heart wrenching plot. Different than the novel it was based on, but it has the same central points. Its easily as good as the book."
"113",4.5,"  Love, Simon is not a film to change how our society views the world, but it certainly offers an enjoyable film as well as an opportunity for everyone to do some self-reflection.. Love, Simon's sweet and awkward humor will do a great job at getting into the frustrations of teenagers, as its protagonist goes through similar issues as many typical adolescents. While creating a relatable character, the film does a fantastic job of developing said character into a more nuanced category; adolescents who identify as a part of the LGBTQ+ community are able to use this film to find someone in the media to truly relate to. It's about time there has been a lovable gay protagonist! In the end, this film is not perfect. It has its clichÈs and predictable moments, but it isn't without reason. The purpose of this movie is not to tell a groundbreaking or mind-provoking story, but to tell a genuine story. Teenagers don't want a magical character to relate to-- they want someone real. And that is exactly what this film offers: someone real that everyone, straight, gay, or anything in between can relate to and appreciate."
"114",5,"  This movie was long overdue and perfectly done. Had me fooled on what the surprise ending was going to be which is not an easy thing to do. Loved it and will be going back to the theatre to see it again!"
"115",5,"  Incredible. I cried and laugh a lot."
"116",5,"  Everyone deserves a great love story. But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it's a little more complicated: he's yet to tell his family or friends he's gay and he doesn't actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing."
"117",5,"  EXCELLENT. Even my republican parents got teary eyed. Haha."
"118",4.5,"  Was it the best movie i've ever watched? no. Was it something my 22 year old self needed at 13? Absolutly. It really was a wonderfil coming of age film, that I think a lot of LGBT kids can relate too. *Spoiler* but my favorite part had to be the google-ing ""how to dress gay"" like who hasn't done that? I loved it, laughed and even teared up a little. Honestly, I encourage everyone to go watch it and continue supporting it because we need Hollywood to know that these films can make profit & for more films like this to be released!!"
"119",5,"  Definitely recommend, made my gay heart so happy and definitely gave me the warm fuzzy feelings even with the sad moment"
"120",5,"  This was a beautiful film. I only cried four times. I would watch this over and over."
"121",4,"  Heartwarming with a twist."
"122",5,"  Gorgeous movie with a very important storyline, allows the viewer to see into Simon's thoughts throughout his emails to Blue and captivates the viewer in a way that propels them to wonder who Blue is and what is going to happen next."
"123",5,"  Great movie in so many ways! :)"
"124",5,"  As an 18 year old lesbian, this movie struck a major cord with me. Maybe I'm bias, but this movie blew me away. I don't see this kind of thing often, I hate romcoms and coming-of-age stories usually because they feel entirely unrelatable to me. This one didn't, it was different. I've never cried at a movie until I heard this one say things to me that I desperately needed to hear. It was beyond my expectations and I recommend it highly to any LGBT+ person with a couple hours to spare."
"125",4.5,"  It was such a great movie. I loved and I want to see it again."
"126",3.5,"  Empathetic and heartfelt, Love Simon overcome some missteps and offers an enjoyable coming-of-age film."
"127",4,"  While it falls right in with the ranks of past teen rom-com classics of the '80s and '90s, this is an updated version and a much needed one. Nick Robinson carries the role of leading man well, and while all of the supporting cast succeeds, Natasha Rothwell gives a standout comedic performance."
"128",5,"  Funny and heartwarming."
"129",0.5,"  What a joke of a movie."
"130",5,"  I've seen Love, Simon multiple times and each time is just as enjoyable, if not more so, than the 1st. This movie feels like therapy in a way. You laugh, cry, cheer along with everyone else in the theater, it's happened at every showing I've been to. This movie has made me deal with ghosts from my past, truths about my present, and the reality of my future. This movie means a lot to me, and for that i am thankful. I am not a young man, but I still have a lot of life left in me and I plan on living it to the fullest. I plan on living my life being more myself than I've been in a long time. Those of you that have seen the movie will recognize that quote. I thought turning 40 would be hard, a challenge. Yes, it's been a challenge, but it hasn't been hard. Being honest with myself, taking a real hard look at who I am, who I want to be, and what I want in this life, that has been the challenge and its been the greatest change in my life. Sorry if this post seems sappy, but i am not sorry for sharing it. I highly recommend going to see this movie, weither you're gay, straight, confused, married, single, or just OTHER. Love, Simon is just a great movie with a killer soundtrack, (I highly recommend getting the vinyl copy as well, its AMAZING). It might not change your life or provide you with greater insight, or that of someone you love or care for, but it'll definitely entertain you, and isn't that all we can ask for."
"131",4,"  4.0/5.0 stars - Grade: B+"
"132",3.5,"  If you can get past the first 5-7 minutes which made me want to leave the theater since what I saw was so cliche, then you get a decent coming of age-type movie, with a diverse cast. If you want a REALLY GOOD coming of age film, see Ladybird. This was a good effort though, with a clever plot device. A bit too idyllic. My partner filmed a scene for about 8 hours for this film, and perhaps we were sort of disappointed with the movie since his scene was left on the editing room floor."
"133",5,"  Best movie I ever seen"
"134",5,"  Loved it!!! Our teenagers absolutely loved it!!! Can't stop talking about it!"
"135",4,"  Not the best teen movie I've ever seen, but very sweet and charming. I liked every character, (well, except the one we weren't supposed to like) and they all felt like real kids dealing with real issues. Yes, the ending is a bit pie in the sky, but the journey was compelling. Recommended!"
"136",4,"  Like a warm hug 16 year old me needed. Very thankful for everyone in my life who loves me as much as I love them no matter what ^_^Too bad this isn't going to premiere in Malaysia"
"137",5,"  I see the John Hughes inspiration, but I think Greg Berlanti did an awesome job making an extremely relatable film which reminds me of so many of my own life experiences... Thanks for a great film!!! I love the Arrow-verse, keep up the great work ~√∞~√∞~"
"138",5,"  Amazingly written and acted. beautiful story"
"139",5,"  I saw this movie. This movie showed me to a whole nother world on how hard it is for LGBTQ people. It made me cry, knowing this actually happens."
"140",4.5,"  This may very well be the greatest teen romance movie of this generation, not only because of how it has successfully become a milestone of inclusion, but also for its very relatable and well done story, along with likable and diverse characters."
"141",5,"  Loved and related to this movie!!"
"142",1,"  I saw this film based on the strong critic and audience ratings. For me, it fell flat and I came close to walking out. There was no depth or heart in the story or the characters, even though they tried. And it was classically predictable. On the plus side, Nick Robinson was well cast and did a good job in the lead role. Jennifer Garner's role was a walk-through and her performance was a B-. Worse was Josh Duhamel, who seems like a nice guy in real life and was appealing in Las Vegas in 2003-2008 and has done nothing of substance since. The rest of the characters were incredibly white-bread, a collection of cute kids with nice smiles. Based on the reviews, I suspect most people will like it. In my opinion, the reviews and the film missed the mark."
"143",5,"  I finally know why hetero people love romcoms. The amount of awkwardness and emotional situations the characters went through was so relatable to anyone who has ever gone been there. My girlfirend and I were laughing, crying and cheering though the whle movie and plan on seeing it mulitple times."
"144",5,"  Love it, this movie is near perfect <3"
"145",4.5,"  i'm gay so i'm kinda obliged to love this movie but even if i wasn't gay i would love it because there's no universe that i'm not gay"
"146",5,"  This movie was phenomenal. I really went in not expecting much but it is the type of coming of age movie that children need."
"147",5,"  It was perfect. I laughed, i cried, and now all i want to do is watch it again. I didn't want it to end."
"148",5,"  AMAZING!!!!!!!! Very funny, lighthearted and relatable. WE NEED SO MANY MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS"
"149",3.5,"  Love, Simon abandons most teen-targeted clich√©s in favor of a sweet and often quirkly coming-of-age story that's as engaging as it is funny, with a talented young cast, smart writing, and a film that could possibly be a game-changer in high school rom-com filmmaking!"
"150",4.5,"  Will make you laugh, cry, and cheer!"
"151",5,"  god i love being gay"
"152",5,"  i was sobbing through the entire thing wow. it was amazing and the talks that simon had with his parents are the kind of talks i wish my parents gave me when i came out. as well, the set design was amazing? there were oreo packs strewn around simon's room and there's a nod to simon's email in the book with ""hour to hour note to note"" written on one of his bedrooms walls. the vice principals office is also adorable with posters telling students to bring him and apple and the poster behind his desk having pictures of student volunteers. as a whole it was gay, great, the movie of my dreams and oreos have been confirmed as gay culture thanks."
"153",2,"  Definitely some dumb cheesy scenes, but besides that it was pretty spot on about being gay and the struggles of coming out. However, since when are clich√© teen romance movies good? Or all we just pretending to like it because it's a gay love story? Yes, I appreciate movies like Love, Simon for opening up the film industry for more casual LGBTQ films; but that doesn't make this the ""BEST"" movie. Jennifer Garner was pretty great though, she was the only one casted well. That being said, it wasn't as bad as other bad teen romance movies; there wasn't an overwhelming amount of over exaggerated dramatic scenes, which is good."
"154",5,"  A fantastic movie. Just wish it had existed 20 years ago. Maybe then coming out wouldn't have been so hard."
"155",5,"  Such a great movie with a great message. Job well done by all."
"156",5,"  I'm not the typical 14-year-old girl. I am not a big fan of love stories. I find them very clichÈ and not that enjoyable to watch. This movie is an exception! I actually really like the romance in this movie. This film is about a closeted gay teen named Simon (Nick Robinson) who, after learning about another gay kid on a school website, begins to search for him while also figuring out how to come out. The most important aspect of this movie is, of course, the fact that this is a gay love story. I feel like this movie handles the whole thing very well and very respectfully. It's a very positive and inspirational film. But it's also a gay love story in mainstream media. This is not an Indie film. It is a story about LGBT love that is in wide release. I believe this movie makes a very big step in normalizing LGBT characters in mainstream media, made specifically for teens. But this movie isn't just amazing for that. I love this story in general. It's kind of a mystery and comedy with a little touch of love. Who is Blue? You really get into the mystery. I remember tensing up and whispering to myself whenever I was scared for the characters. I became so invested in them and hoped it was the person I wanted it to be. It is also about friendship and how fragile our friendships can be and how we use and treat people.The characters boil down to one trait as their whole personality, but I still liked them. I would have liked to see more depth in Simon's friend circle. I like Abby's (Alexandra Shipp) character the most. She's Simon's newest friend who has just moved from D.C. and it seems like every guy is interested in her. But she is not the typical ""hot teen, mean girl,"" she is kind. Simon, of course, is a total show stealer. Not surprising at all, Simon is a charming character who you wish you were best friends with too. You just want him to find Blue so he can be happy because, as the movie posters say, ""Everyone deserves a great Love Story."" My only issues with this movie come down to how weird the theatre teacher and the vice principal are. They are a little over the top. While I liked Ms. Albright (Natasha Rothwell), she swore at students (which isn't allowed), even though they deserved it. And, it felt as if the vice principal (Tony Hale) clearly wanted to be seen as cool, but he ends up being way too invested in people's love lives. All in all, I love this romantic comedy and give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18.reviewed by calista b., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."
"157",5,"  Definitely worth watching. I wish this movie was around when I was 15."
"158",5,"  This is a very well done movie. Not too heavy but showcases the angst of young gays who are stuck in a dilemma of coming out. Well written and very enjoyable."
"159",5,"  Love Simon is the movie I needed. I never knew what it was like to have a supporting family when I came out and it hit so hard when I realized what I missed. Please watch this movie."
"160",4.5,"  A wonderful movie for all ages! Especially the youth...loved it....go see!"
"161",5,"  Great movie! Original, engaging, tear-jerking. This movie really found a way to help others to understand what this young man is going through. Everyone should see this movie, to expand their understanding of this ever relevant reality. Plus it is funny and heartfelt!"
"162",5,"  My ratings aren't very polished. Just a warning.This is a great movie for people who don't need to be overly lectured about gay people.I remember Moonlight took best picture. I was cheering for La la land. So I decided to give Moonlight a try. I probably wouldn't have watched it if it didn't win best picture.There's a big difference between ""Love, Simon"" and ""Moonlight"".Movies are basically ""empathy engines"". They evoke empathy from the audience, as well as educate and entertain.That's the big difference in my opinion between Love Simon and Moonlight.Love Simon is much more balanced. It's an empathy engine, it's educational, and most importantly it's entertaining and has some lighter humorous moments.Moonlight is also an empthy engine, and educational. But almost felt like a chore to me.Don't get me wrong. Both of these movies are monumental triumphs for the gay community. The world is a better place simply because both of these movies exist.However, if you're a person who already is educated about gay people, and you already have tolerance, compassion, and respect towards gay people, and you're straight......... then I would recommend Love Simon instead.Bottom line, Love Simon has humor and is entertaining.Moonlight felt like a chore. Like I was lectured for a couple of hours on how anyone can be gay. Even some tough guy. A condescending chore, that took 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.Moonlight to me is for people who need more education or empathy.Love Simon is for people who don't necessarily need more of those things, and want to be entertained as well."
"163",5,"  Worth every penny!!! Great scripts and great casts!"
"164",5,"  I loved this movie so much. I laughed a lot and I loved the acting and the drama. Very well done and even though is not realistic, it makes you fantasize that one day being gay will be seen that natural."
"165",5,"  AMC Universal City Walk Hollywood"
"166",5,"  Genuine. Heartfelt. Effortlessly funny."
"167",5,"  Touching movie. It shows what gay teenagers would go through/experience when they come out. It shows people to not be afraid of who they are and that's a really important message in life. I really enjoyed this movie and give it 5 stars."
"168",5,"  THE BEST, FELT MORE ENLIGHTENED THEN WHEN I SAW MICHELLE OBAMA. LOTS OF PANIC AT THE DISCO REFERENCES."
"169",4,"  What at sweet movie. Granted a bit formulaic, with exception of the lead being gay - secret to hide, someone finds out, friends offended, blah, blah. But it was so refreshing to see a movie with a gay lead and romantic as well. Wish had this when i was a wee gay. It was just cute overall. I just assumed it was not a big deal anymore, but it likely will always be when coming out."
"170",5,"  Cute, funny and heart warming."
"171",4,"  This is a John Hughes film for a new generation. Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel are perfect as Simon's loving, supportive parents. Nick Robinson is wonderful as Simon. Simon is a good son, brother and friend with very little rebellious teenage angst. He is an engaging high school senior with a secret. Simon floats between the cliques but sticks with his closest friends. The conflict comes from Simon's not wanting his life to change, not from his letting people know he is gay. Those closest to him are more upset that he was keeping something from them than the actual secret. If the tweens sitting behind me are a sample, this film is an excellent illustration of our changing times. If you are a fan of teen movies, as I am, I recommend this film."
"172",5,"  I felt as though this was a heartwarming story that helps to normalize the lives and emotions of gay people. I found my story connected to Simon's and found many of the things I have gone through in my life reflected in his trials but ultimately he shows that hes just like everyone else, except he is attracted to men. The plot itself used many tropes of romantic comedies and coming of age stories so it wasnt original, but it was normalizing and i find that refreshing."
"173",4,"  A great rom-com. It approaches the genre like very few others. I think it effectively conveyed the difficulty that people have to go through when coming out to friends and family. By design there were many parts where I cringed super hard. There were tear jerking moments that almost got me, and jokes that hit hard, solid movie."
"174",5,"  Most touching movie I've seen in a long time. Loved this movie."
"175",4.5,"  To anyone else this movie may just be another teen coming-of-age film, but to those who have really been there--who can really relate--this movie is for them. ""Love, Simon"" is meant for all those teenagers on the LGBTQIA+2 spectrum so that they too can have their movie, cry with characters they can relate to, and maybe even heal some of their own scars."
"176",5,"  Something in the mainstream media that people like me can relate to, to see us represented on the big screen is amazing and something that we needed in this world. I hope this encourages Hollywood to continue to be more diverse"
"177",5,"  I loved this movie! It really touched me deeply and I feel it has inspired people of the LGBT community to accept themselves and has made people more mindful of them and to be more accepting. And also, I cried for most of the movie LOL"
"178",5,"  Amazing! Beautiful! Inspiring! Only movie that has made me cry. We really needed this movie. It has had a great impact on me already!Love, Pierre-Luc"
"179",5,"  Well casted and well written. Was able to deliver a light hearted movie that spoke to a controversial topic. Would watch again."
"180",3.5,"  seriously laugh at, cry at and be flabbergasted at such a low budget this movies takes the cake, eats a piece, then gives the rest to everyone else. Highly recommend. Great movie. Good way to kick off 2018 along with SOLO coming out. Hype"
"181",5,"  Love, Simon is, in my opinion, a story that needs to be told over and over and over again. Young people tortured by the truth and/or fear that they are gay often do not have ears to turn to for reassure. The paraphrase a line in the movie, coming out or announcing anything else monumental, can be a terrifying experience. ""What if the world doesn't like you?"" If you haven't seen it, it is a must. If you are a young person struggling to come to terms with your sexuality, please know that there are many out there that love you for who you are."
"182",5,"  A great movie, totally recommend for everyone especially teens. It is funny and sad and happy."
"183",4.5,"  Such a beautiful, amazing film. A touching, wonderful story. Following Simon Spier, a closeted gay teenager in high school who is threatened with having his secret outed to the entire school. And with any high school coming-of-age film, this film does fall into some of those clichÈd traps, but they don't take away from the powerful script. Across the board, the cast is fantastic. Nick Robinson as Simon, one of the greatest performances I've seen this year, if not the best so far. Such an authentic feeling film, so powerful and leading with an important message. No matter who you are, or your age, you can relate to these characters or simply feel for them. Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner as Simon's parents, Katherine Langford (13 Reasons Why) and the CW's Keiynan Lonsdale (Kid Flash) as Simon's friends -- all just excellently written and executed. Perfectly written story, the performances, the direction. This is the kind of film I can see myself seeing many times in the theater, such a wonderful time. Please go check this one out! This will easily end up being one of my top favorites of the year."
"184",5,"  LOVED this movie SO MUCH."
"185",4.5,"  Love, Simon is a thoroughly enjoyable film that is relatable on every level. It's got great characters that fuel even better moments. This is a movie about people, not a movie about a gay teenager, and for that I respect it."
"186",4,"  I wound up really liking this movie. Coming of age/romcoms have gotten routine and by the numbers in recent years, but this movie stood out because of its charming cast & it's heartfelt story of being gay and coming out as a teenager. Nick Robinson was great for the role of Simon."
"187",5,"  One of the best movies I've seen!"
"188",5,"  The story was amazingly paced. The drama of the plot was well balanced with the comedy. I have never laughed, smiled, and cried so much from a movie in ages. Definitely worth the watch."
"189",4,"  Good entry, Right story depiction, Good interpretation and in the right genre"
"190",5,"  Love, Simon is a amazing movie and help those less understanding see what it is like for someone going through something similar to this. It had a strong plot and did the book justice, sitting in the cinema whacking this you could see everybody quite and invested in the film. I would really recommend anybody to go see it, you want be dissapointed."
"191",5,"  Loved it, not gay myself but I definatly identified with the Simon character a lot. This is a great coming of age story, and will hopfully become an instant classic."
"192",5,"  This was such a heartwarming, sweet movie. Had me in tears! 10/10 would reccomend."
"193",4,"  Charming, powerful, and light-filled."
"194",5,"  If you're a fan of love and people and gay kids coming out with support, please please go see the movie, Love, Simon. Great actors and music. Feels like the teen movie of the era but appeals to the masses. It is supremely wonderful. So heartwarming, affirming and cathartic. Pro-tip: pick up extra napkins at concessions. You'll def need em."
"195",5,"  This movie accuracy is at its best. It's was awesome!"
"196",5,"  SEE THIS MOVIE. It's the perfect balance of humor and serious dialogue. It opens the door to many important conversations that we need to incorporate into our lives more regularly. Great cast. Well written script."
"197",5,"  Heart felt movie. Absolutely loved it"
"198",5,"  I would watch this movie a thousand times. It had great representation and made me go through an emotional roller coaster. I read the book before seeing the movie and I am not dissapointed at all."
"199",5,"  FOR THOSE THAT HAVE HAD THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF COMING OUT, YOU KNOW THE PAIN, OVERWHELMING STRESS, & PANIC INDUCING ANXIETY, THIS MOVIE BROUGHT ME BACK TO THAT MOMENT VERY QUICKLY. I'M NOT A PERSON THAT CRIES AT TV SHOWS OR WITH MOVIES, BUT THIS MOVIE HIT SO CLOSE TO HOME IT WAS CRAZY. THE ACTING WAS GOOD, THE TOPIC AND RELATABILITY OF THE TOPIC WAS SPOT ON. I'M ACTUALLY CONSIDERING WATCHING IT A SECOND TIME, WHICH DOESN'T EVER HAPPEN."
"200",3.5,"  Annie and I saw ""Love, Simon"" last week and liked it. Some really strong and memorable moments when it counted."
"201",5,"  I just saw this in theaters wirh some friends. This movie noy only has amazing scene-shots but an amazing cast. The people who're in production and acting for this film are totally heartfelt. You can tell they put their hearts into making this real. I cried during nearly the entire movie. Every scene had something beautiful in it.A part that hit me hard was the scene with Simon's mom telling him that he deserves everything good. She still loved Simon even after he was out. It hit me hard because it's something personal. I wish my own mom would've had that reaction. Instead I got the butt-end of that ""accepting parent"" stick.I hope all of you out there, out or not, are happy. I hope you enjoy your lives to the fullest, YOUR fullest."
"202",5,"  So well done. More than just a great coming of age, young romance film. It's important. And incredibly entertaining. It sheds much, much light on what it's like growing up when people look at you as different. Brilliant."
"203",5,"  Such an amazing movie!!! Absolutely loved it!! A must see for sure."
"204",4,"  You didn't like Black Panther!? You're racist!You didn't like The Last Jedi!? You're a sexist pig! You don't think Wonder Woman should be nominated for an Oscar? You hate diversity!I'm starting to feel like I live in a world where my real opinions on the new age of progressive blockbusters are being held hostage by those that leverage people's fear of being called a racist, homophobe, or sexist against them. I mean heaven forbid if instead of getting offended and recklessly labeling someone, they actually consult their own ideas and explore them in a constructive conversation!So, let me clarify: I don't have a problem with the new age of blockbusters that are sending messages of equality, empowerment, and diversity, I have problem with the lackluster delivery of those messages. This is precisely why I love Greg Berlanti's Love, Simon. It isn't a film that demands to be called a classic just because of its progressive ideas on sexuality. It actually earns your respect and admiration with the care it puts into the parts that drive its message home. It's a movie that's hilarious as it is heartfelt, has a story that moves at an immaculate pace, and features fully realized characters that you'll remember long after you've left the theater.The Plot: Simon is a high school senior with a good head on his shoulders and everything going for him -- he has a happy family, loyal friends, and is all geared up and ready for college. But he has a secret that's been eating at him since middle school: he's gay. Having only one year left of high school, he wants to keep his ""normal life"" before coming out and truly being himself in college. But then his whole world changes when a boy anonymously comes out of the closet on his school's social network. Simon decides to connect with him under an alias, and as they bond over their situation, they eventually fall in love. Who is this boy? Will they reveal their identities to each other? Will they come out of the closet before graduation? These are the questions that keep the story moving.Now I haven't approached anything near the teen drama realm in years, so naturally, this movie's style caught me off guard. The color contrast is dialed up, the lighting is bright, and the way in which these characters exchange lines is very on the nose. But after about 5 minutes, I was able to settle in, as the aesthetic matches the feel-good tone of the film.The Acting: Nick Robinson (The 5th Wave) as the everyday teen that likes hanging out with his friends, getting coffee, and obsessing over music actually feels very real. There's a genuine charm to the actor that allows the low-key comedic delivery in his narration to be effective. He's also able to handle the lows that his character goes through without coming off as overdramatic. The rest of the actors that play his friends are all convincing in getting across that lifelong friendship dynamic with the actor, and I was very surprised with Josh Duhamel (a ""bro"" who always came off to me as a stock TV actor), who puts on a shockingly vulnerable performance as Simon's dad, but what really jumped off the screen at me were all the hilarious side characters. Tony Hale (Buster from Arrested Development) is great as the kids' awkwardly down to earth principal, but Natasha Rothwell as the defeated but scathingly sassy drama teacher stole the show for me. The film moves at a beautiful pace and manages to be both funny and heartfelt without being sappy. Most importantly, it's easy to take this ride with Simon through the highs and lows of his senior year because screenwriters, Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, have maintained the original novel's ability to make his struggle universally relatable, regardless of whether you're straight or gay. If you've ever felt like you're ""holding your breath"" because you feel different, alienated, or lost, you will feel a strong connection to this film.Overall, Love, Simon reminds me of a combination of the humor of Mean Girls meets the coming of age story of a John Hughes film. I understand there have been many films that have explored the many issues the LGBT community faces, but the fact that director, Greg Berlanti and co., are able take this tale of sexual self-discovery to the mainstream and make it relatable on such a wide scale is important. I firmly believe this film will go on to educate, empower, and possibly save lives."
"205",5,"  Was a beautiful rollercoaster of emotions and twists. I could not contain my screams and emotions. Honestly I left the theatre with a pounding heart and drained muscles with the bliss of endorphins released after performing the horizontal two step (too much? Well it's true) beautiful beautiful movie."
"206",3.5,"  My best friend got me into Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda, the book which Love, Simon is based on. It's definitely one of the best YA novels I've read, but given everything I know about Hollywood's business practices, it was never a sure deal that the movie would be anywhere near as good as the book. Thankfully, I can say Love, Simon is a great movie worthy of the source material.To be clear, though, Love, Simon is not the most faithful adaptation. It takes the same plot points but follows them very loosely. Some scenes are embellished for dramatic effect. Others are streamlined to keep the narrative focus. That's probably why the movie is named Love, Simon rather than Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda. Among the few ways this adaptation falters, though, is the new characters, namely the shameless vice principal included for comedic effect. Given the book's characters already entertain with their witty banter, his presence in the movie is redundant at best. Another subplot, involving Katherine Langford's (13 Reasons Why) Leah, is shoehorned and will rub fans of the book the wrong way. What's most important, however, is that the movie retains the book's voice, and it does without missing a beat. Despite being a PG-13 movie, nothing is sanitized, not even the book's profanity or sexually explicit talk. Simon and co.'s quick-witted, tech-savvy, and pop-culture infused voice is not only still there, it gets enhanced by the big screen.If I were to describe Love, Simon in one word, it would be smooth. Everything about this movie is so smooth. That quick-witted tone powers through the first two acts non-stop up until the narrative gets really serious. The sound-track seamlessly transitions to and from alternative pop, electronic, and original music. Nothing exemplifies this movie's smoothness more than Simon's car driving past to reveal an opening credit. While many other movies fumble their flashback or fantasy sequences, those scenes fit perfectly in Love, Simon. That the director behind Love, Simon is himself a gay man is to the movie's advantage. From this movie's queer camera angles, if you'll excuse the pun, to everything about Simon's experience, this movie rings true to the queer experience. Love, Simon is an excellent movie for both LGBT+ and straight moviegoers."
"207",4,"  It's good for the industry. So this is about a senior boy in high school (Nick Robinson). He is still in the closet, but when somebody anonymously reveals that they are also gay on the high school gossip website, he strikes up an e-mail friendship that starts to blossom into something more. While I am not gay, I most definitely appreciate diversity in film. Honestly, white straight males have had their run on Hollywood this entire time, and it is about time we see different points of view not only to be fair, but to also keep things fresh. While I wouldn't consider this to be groundbreaking, as this does fit right into the mold of a standard coming of age movie, I am positive this will do wonders for the different types of movies we get going forward if its a hit. Now I was excited for this, but I don't think I ever expected to dig this movie to the extent that I did. I kind of view this as a more successful version of The Edge of Seventeen, and they probably would make for a pretty good double feature together. The story really pulls you in with jokes that hit as you get to know Simon, and I didn't know that Nick Robinson had a performance like this in him. The only other movie I have seen him in is the special effect heavy Jurassic World, and while I love that, I have to admit that he is only asked to do so much next to the dinosaurs. Love, Simon not only does a really good job of making you believe the actors are the age that they are portraying, but it also makes you realize how different high school is nowadays with technology and social media. Information and gossip can travel like wildfire because you can post it for all to see instead of having to physically relay information on phone or in person, so when a bomb gets dropped online after school, you know you are going to walk into stares the following day, even from the school staff. Regardless if you are gay or not, there is very likely going to be a character in this that you are going to be able to see yourself in, at least to some degree. Everybody is going to react differently to this secret, and I think this is a story that successfully showcases what coming out is all about. I know that this movie is going to mean a lot to its intended audience, but even if you aren't in that group, it is still relatable, as this guy is just an awkward teenager longing for a connection, just like everybody else in this world. It is rare that I recommend a movie to everyone when I don't consider it to be perfect, but this is that case."
"208",1,"  I was excited about this movie and I wanted to like it despite the cheesy trailer, but it fell short. Love, Simon very much felt like a movie created by straight people for a straight audience so they could feel all liberal and progressive about themselves. This didn't feel real to me. Everything was generic. Everything was so generic that nothing about this movie felt specific to the queer experience-even coming out was framed as merely an example of a universal experience. Most infuriatingly vapid was the film's central metaphor, that being gay is like a ferris wheel because life has its ups and downs. The film's creators were clearly trying hard to make their straight audience identify with Simon, which is all well and good, but this easy identification comes at the expense of any truth or complexity in the story. Straight people may watch this and feel that they understand the gay experience because they too have their ups and downs and they too sometimes find it difficult to open up to people, but the gayness in Love, Simon is incredibly superficial. Most gays are not white, upper-middle class, suburban boys with two progressive parents and a little sister. I am all of those things, just like Simon, and yet I still found myself utterly unable to identify with him. There was nothing to identify with. His character had no substance. The other characters were no better.I'm glad that Hollywood has finally decided that it can sufficiently profit off gay people and allies for gay films to be a profitable endeavor, but the film industry can do better.One final note-I've heard this referred to as a romcom, but this film was neither particularly romantic nor a comedy. The jokes are sparse and seemed to be designed for a straight audience, just like the rest of the movie."
"209",5,"  While marketed as a romcom, Love Simon manages to balance the typical expectations of the genre with a decent representation of life as a queer kid today. Various scenes had me turning to my friend, whisper-shouting how true the experiences are. Love simon is, all in all, a cute story with an extremely relatable protagonist(for LGBT audience members at least). Bonus points for a high quality LGBT film that doesn't end in death, disease, or depression. Taking my mom to go see it soon."
"210",5,"  I finally have my own high school movie!! Thanks Greg Berlanti, Nick Robinson and Fox for a cinematic experience I'll never forget! This film will save lives, many lives, you can count on that!"
"211",5,"  inspirational, beautiful, incredible, amazing... just a couple words i can use to describe how groundbreaking this movie was. i loved the book, so seeing simon's story come to life was just wonderful. it was a story of teen love, coming of age, friendship, and family. it has offered much needed representation and acceptance to millions around the world. i'm still in awe."
"212",5,"  I loved how the movie was related to hight schoolers and it was not just a teen girl movie boys and adults can see it too."
"213",5,"  This is the movie the LGBT movie needs and deserves. I honestly thought it was better than the book and really filled in some gaps that the reading left out. It's tear jerking and tugs at your heart strings so much that you will be crying from start to finish."
"214",5,"  Almost perfect. All I could think about while watching Simon was that if John Hughes had made a movie for me during my adolescent years, it would have been just like this. This is a movie that teens and adults will watch and find a piece they can all relate to. It is about compassion, angst and the idea that our experiences are not as different as we would like to think."
"215",5,"  Extremely well made, and strikes the right balance between humor and depth. Great moments for laughter and tears, and the audience in my theater clapped at the ending! I thought it did an awesome job of conveying the internal turmoil and thought processes behind coming out, and portrayed each coming out conversation really honestly. Great casting and solid performances from everyone, especially Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner. Super thankful to Fox and Greg Berlanti for making this movie! It's an amazing feeling to finally get to identify with the main character of a movie, and get to see an experience similar to my own portrayed on screen! I've seen it twice already, but I could watch it 100 more times and I would gladly if I could convince someone new to give it a chance each time!"
"216",5,"  I don't have too much to say other than I love this movie! The amazing cast of Love Simon portrays an even more amazing story. Simon is a lot of us deep down and is the hero many young people need. Refreshing as all hell."
"217",5,"  This was an amazing movie that was so moving and truly touched my heart. I would give it a 10000000000000/10 if I could :)"
"218",4,"  This was a fun, sweet movie that had many clever and relatable moments, and is an important milestone for inclusive teen romances, that also teaches some lessons along the way."
"219",4.5,"  Super sweet, great story. ??"
"220",3.5,"  ""You get to exhale now, Simon."" Our protagonist, a closeted gay teenager, spends his story learning that he's as worthy to live as anyone else. This humanizing of the LGBT community is the soul of Love, Simon. So not only is the movie funny, romantic and emotional, it's vital. Underneath it's occasionally cliched tendencies, it's a heartfelt and lovingly made love story that allows a complex, confusing and invigorating part of life be just that: complex, confusing and invigorating. Love, Simon would be forgiven if, like so many other coming-out films, it was an ultra-depressing melodrama. However, it takes a different approach. Sure, there are brief moments of blatant bigotry, a couple of beautiful parent-reaction scenes, and some hilarious over-compensation by ""woke"" supporters. However, this story takes place in the modern world, in which homosexuality isn't nearly as taboo as it was even just a couple years ago. So instead of the big, obvious fears that kids who come out face (social rejection, familial disappointment, etc), it gets into the real dirt. Will my friends see to me differently? Will my identity be solely wrapped up in who I'm attracted to? Can I control other's perceptions of me?That tendency for honest authenticity are the film's strengths. It makes it all the more frustrating that the crux of the plot revolves around a side-character who is neither honest nor authentic, but purely a device for pushing a predictable and unnecessary plot along. It's such distractingly poor writing, a lesser film would've broken under its contrived weight. But Love, Simon's strengths of big-heart and familiar humor completely win out, giving us the best Hollywood-high-school flick since Clueless."
"221",5,"  GROWING UP IN THE 80'S I was fortunate enough to see the films of a fantastic writer director of teen movies, his name was john hughes. This movie felt to me like a modern john hughes teen movie. The one twist that john never had a chance to do is make a gay teen the main character. the movement from scene to scene and the character's have depth yet not enough not to OVERRIDE simon leaving the watcher to feel simons angst that much more. As far as the writing it was excellent and can appeal to older generations who struggled the same as simon, maybe the method of coming out has changed but the emotion has not, love,simon spreads that STRUGGLE through the generations. Though the ending could have been more romantic it was awkward like first love always is. if you're a parent wanting to understand what your child is or has gone through this is a great movie to process what it is like for them."
"222",5,"  Such a sweet show. It was so unlike the shows I had as a young teenager to see gay life. Just a good feel show, that you wished every person coming out could have as there truth. Very positive for all."
"223",5,"  This movie brought so many emotions to the surface. it was such a solid movie. it had a great mix of feelings that really showed what life is like for closeted gay teens. i went and saw it multiple times. i just can't get enough of it."
"224",3.5,"  WHO LOVES YOU, BABY? - My Review of LOVE, SIMON (3 1/2 Stars)The poster reads: Everyone Deserves A Great Love Story. I would add that each generation deserves a great teen movie. Think back to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, BYE BYE BIRDIE, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, SIXTEEN CANDLES, HEATHERS, ELECTION, MEAN GIRLS, and PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER for a small sampling over the decades. During those formative years, I think everybody looks back so fondly on this specific genre. Now, director Greg Berlanti and writers Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker have adapted Becky Albertalli's novel ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" to create something groundbreaking, the first major studio film to have a gay teen lead character. Love it or hate it, like BLACK PANTHER, this film has the potential to inspire generations of kids who have never seen themselves at the center of a story. Back in 2005, the success of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN seemed to indicate that the studios would produce more films with leading gay characters. It didn't happen, so here we are at another crossroads, where the very successful TV producer, with a roster of Superhero shows to his credit, and who started his career with the gay film, THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB, become the great gay hope of saving gay cinema. It's hardly fair to expect such an outcome, considering the multitude of filmmakers who have produced much more layered, experimental fare than LOVE, SIMON...but Simon has made it into the multiplexes and national ads...so he feels the pressure. So is it any good, and how does it stack up against the great teen movies? Not great, but not bad either. It's a calculated film, devoid of anything too controversial, filled with a surprisingly diverse cast, and hedging its bets at times. You're not gonna hear any character say anything as remotely inspired as ""Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Teresa?"" in this film. LOVE, SIMON operates firmly in the ""Young Adult"" genre that has seen great success with the megahit THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. That movie seems to provide the template - a slightly comedic, but mostly serious tone. What I hated more than anything was the opening moment. Simon (Nick Robinson of JURASSIC WORLD), who lives with his perfect family (Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel, and his kid sister/aspiring chef, played by the wonderful Talitha Bateman), bounds out of their McMansion and into a fancy SUV as he says in voiceover, ""I'm just like you"". I immediately recoiled, wondering how anyone living in a dumpy hovel would relate to this. Now I know I'm not the target audience for this film, and the story lives firmly inside upper middle class suburbia, but it felt tone deaf right off the bat.Things eventually kick in as we explore Simon's world, filled with good friends, old and new. From the trailers, however, you know that Simon has a secret - he's gay and not ready to share that with the world. Instead, he develops an e-mail relationship with another closeted gay kid, both of them anonymously baring their souls to each other. Simon spends the rest of the story trying to figure out the identity of this ""pen pal"", with whom he's fallen in love. As such, the movie has a whodunit structure, filled with sly misdirects and an 11th hour surprise. It's a surprisingly rich film, filled with characters, despite the overall edge-free tone, who all get their moments of substance. Although nowhere near as affecting as Michael Stuhlbarg's big moment in CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, Garner and Duhamel each have wonderful scenes when their son comes out to them. Duhamel, in particular, made me cry. Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. all have a sweet, snappy rapport with our hero, and storylines to suggest their lives don't just revolve around him (a refreshing thing for this genre), but it's all pitched at a rich kid blandness level at times. The people Simon suspects of being ""Blue"", the name of his pen pal, get able portrayals as well from the likes of Joey Pollari (great in AMERICAN CRIME), Miles Heizer, and Keiynan Lonsdale. It doesn't help that Simon himself is a bit of a bore. Robinson has a strong presence, but I just wanted him to be funny more often. Think of Molly Ringwald's deliciously mouth-breathing Samantha Baker in SIXTEEN CANDLES as she reacts to her panties on display in that famous scene. She's delightfully captivating. Winona Ryder furiously writing notes while sporting a monocle in HEATHERS held you firmly in her grips. Simon, on the other hand, while not ashamed to be gay, feels sullen and receding. While the mystery storyline will likely keep you guessing throughout, the big reveal felt a little false. I do love that two teens learn to love what's inside of someone before seeing the exterior, but in reality, I couldn't help but think that Simon counted his lucky stars that he found his crush attractive. Part of me was hoping the big reveal would turn out to be a female character who is a lesbian. But this is a teen romance and not an LGBT Summit Meeting!Trouble comes in the form of Martin (Logan Miller), the closest the film has to a villain, as a guy who threatens to out Simon if he doesn't fix him up with his friend Abby. Luckily, even Martin gets an empathetic portrayal, with Miller reminding me of a slightly wilder version of Breckin Meyer's character in CLUELESS. I mean, seriously, there's another example of a film with a main character who shines. Come on, Simon, lighten up!I could have done with less Tony Hale (VEEP) as the Vice Principal with a streak for showboating comic relief, but I enjoyed a few of his moments. Same goes for INSECURE's Natasha Rothwell, who adeptly steals every one of her scenes as a beyond-over-it drama coach. If only the central character had been Ethan (Clark Moore), an out gay kid with the hard shell and ""reading"" abilities of the best queens from RuPaul's Drag Race. Now THAT would have been a central gay character who pops, but, alas, the studios just aren't ""there yet"". Baby steps I suppose. LOVE, SIMON, despite the many people of color in the film, is a white movie for the masses. I can't fault it for that, but it's not the most original gay film ever made. For those experiences, go to your local LGBT Film Festival or flip through your streaming options. If this movie causes its audience to do that, then thank you Greg Berlanti and co. for helping to pave the way."
"225",5,"  The most important movie this year. It's time that the gays got a rom-com to be proud of!"
"226",5,"  It is bubblegum in a beautiful Rom-Com package - everything we need for us in the LGBTQ+ community to feel just like everyone else! I cried through a solid 60% of the movie. Well done!!"
"227",3.5,"  I enjoyed Love, Simon immensely! It is a highly polished picture of Simon struggling with his sexuality. If it wasn't such an idealized picture of a well adjusted family, I might have found it more weighty. There just wasn't a spot of grit in it, which might have made it seem more realistic. A great guilty pleasure."
"228",5,"  One of the best coming-of-age films I have seen in a very long time. Setting aside how important this film is to the LGBTQ+ community, although it is undoubtedly a huge factor, this narrative film takes you along the beautiful, exciting, and at times heartbreaking and painful journey of Simon Spier. It's very real, and as viewers you are taken on that journey regardless of whether you relate to the characters sexual orientation. *Spoilers Ahead* When Simon undergoes life's awkward moments, which there are plenty of especially in your teen years, you feel it. When Simon is terriefied of being outed before he is ready, you feel his fear, you understand his anxiety and his nervousness. When he finally confronts his parents, you feel the tension and relief. You tear up and you are filled with emotions. When he finally finds out who the mysterious Blue is, you clap really loudly because everything falls into place and your faith in romance and happy endings is restored once again. A MUST SEE!"
"229",5,"  The most heart-warming movie I've watched in a while, the mood of the movie changed quite often which allowed suspense to overcome me, which added another layer of life to this wonderful film!"
"230",5,"  Super sweet. Thoughtful. Charming. And important. There's a little bit of all of us in this beautiful 80s throwback."
"231",5,"  Love, Simon will make you happier. There's no way around it. Humor, heart, great performances, and a killer soundtrack will take you away to a place where for a little under two hours, you know life will be a little bit better."
"232",5,"  I loved this movie so much!!! It's sooooooo goood. It's like the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life. I love it, if I could I would go see it 10 more times."
"233",5,"  Have seen TWO special screenings of the movie and I absolutely loved it. It's just a great movie, and the subject matter happens to be gay. It appeals to a wide variety of ages, genders, and sexual orientations! And the cast of the movie is diverse as well! It's the gay movie I've been waiting for my whole life and I have so much love and appreciation for having seen it. Whether you're gay, straight, or in between, you will absolutely love this movie! <3"
"234",5,"  This movie really surprised me. I had pre-conceived ideas that it would be your typical teen love story but this movie was much more than that. This movie had a lot of heart and even as a straight man i felt some of the emotion that the lead character was presenting. This movie really made you feel and i loved the family in this movie they were so great. It was much more than a teen romance film, it was about family, friendship, and so much more. Again I was really surprised by this one and loved it!"
"235",5,"  Amazing! Loved every minute of it."
"236",5,"  Watching the different types of people walking into the theatre to watch Love, Simon gives me so much joy but also makes me a bit anxious. Seeing older couples shock me so much bc I'm not entirely sure if they know what they'll be watching. Seeing families with their young kids makes me nervous if the parents would be offended to have their children see gay content. Seeing straight masc bros with their girlfriends and buddies make me wary of homophobic jokes being made. I've seen this movie twice now and in actuality none of that happens. Everyone enjoys it to some degree. In a way, having this type of movie mainstream for everyone to see is like when I used to turn the volume up on the TV at home when gay related news or storylines came on so my mom would hear hoping this would make her more ok with the idea of homosexuality in general. This is that but at a much grander scale. And it's amazing.  I know a lot of people have issues with this movie for it being centered on a white middle class straight passing boy. Obviously it's not perfect. But I think this movie opens the doors for those creators who want to make a diversely represented story in the film industry in the future. I think what I love about this the most is the shared experience the moviegoers have. You can see gays of different ages from older generations who never thought something like this would exist in their lifetime to younger gays with their significant other or their squad who have been craving representation like this. We have been hungry for something like this. And this is such a monumental step for mainstream representation."
"237",3.5,"  Greg Berlanti's ""Love, Simon"" may not be a perfect movie. Yes, there is an entire subplot involving blackmail that kind of takes away from the whole premise of the film. Yes, the central mystery kind of fizzles into a just ""okay"" reveal at the film's conclusion. And, yes, the film's world and high school characters don't feel as real as those on display in movies like ""Superbad,"" ""Me And Earl And The Dying Girl,"" and ""Lady Bird."" But the central elements are all on point. The protagonist, as written and performed, is absolutely stellar and likable. All the scenes involving his internal dilemma are incredibly powerful and moving. And the thematic messages in play here are undeniably relevant. I just feel as though some of the more ancillary elements could have been punched up to make those more central threads even more powerful. But still - an overall enjoyable film."
"238",5,"  This movie was so awesome so touching inspiring I wish there was a movie like this when I was in High school I want to watch it again and again defiantly go watch it."
"239",5,"  MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!"
"240",5,"  This Movie is so beautiful and inspirational and will always be dear to my heart LOVE this movie so much"
"241",4,"  For me, the biggest strength of this movie was not Simon's coming out, nor finding out who Simon's secret lover was, but instead it was getting to know Simon's family. It was incredible to see a movie that demonstrated everything great about what a family unit can be. Simon's family, and their display of support in the film, was marvelous and that aspect of it caught me off guard . But to add to that as well, talk about a movie full of surprises, honest reflection, light humor, and great writing. I got so much more out of this movie than I ever expected. Maybe a bit oversimplified at times, but it was quite a good movie."
"242",5,"  best movie of all time"
"243",5,"  Seeing such a genuine take on a coming out story was incredibly refreshing. You can tell that this movie was written for queer people and those that are looking to support and help nurture their experience. At the end of the day, it could be a shit movie and what it says about coming out, and how it demands love, support, and understanding from people is absolutely remarkable. It also happens that it's not a shit movie. It's funny, and well written, and emotionally enthralling. I feel it has been absolutely wonderful to see a movie like this released, and I hope it would provide the emotional support to young queer people and the families supporting them that many people long past the pinnacle of coming out wish they had had in their corner."
"244",4.5,"  I thought that this was a great adaptation of Becky Albertalli's book, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, and an all around great movie. The only real complaint that I have about the movie is the fact that they left out the part of Martin's backstory from the book involving his brother. While I definitely didn't think it justified Martin's actions towards Simon, it at least explained his actions. Without that part of Martin's backstory being mentioned in the movie, it ultimately made Martin a much less sympathetic and likable character. Other than that, I absolutely loved Love, Simon. :)"
"245",5,"  This movie is very important for us to progress as a society and learn to accept each other for who we are. At the end of the day, who we choose to love is no one's business but your own. The book was amazing as well, and the ending is amazing. Overall just revolutionary! This movie is very important to me personally, and it is important for other members of the LGBTQ+ community in order to recognize that being yourself is okay."
"246",4.5,"  Such a wonderful story of Simon and his struggle deciding when to come out as gay to his friends and family. Great story, well acted, wonderful film."
"247",5,"  Wonderfully touching, coming-of-age dramedy."
"248",4.5,"  The best part of Love, Simon is that is comes across as such a normal love story. It is so relatable. Something like this movie has been missing from genre for a long time. The representation in the film is also important, and stays true to the book in that aspect, which I am very happy about. Although I believe the book was better, the movie is a great take on it and truly heartwarming."
"249",1,"  Nick Robinson's emotionally carried performance does not work here, as it is a bad performance, carried by his co-stars who couldn't even get out a line without a voice-crack."
"250",5,"  The most beautiful and touching movie I have ever seen. I cried so many times during this film and this is something that will bring families together with the message of love in it."
"251",5,"  It was a very good movie that had a great message for anyone in the LGBT community"
"252",1,"  Hollywood delivers another tired gay teen exploitation movie."
"253",1,"  IT had a predicted story line. I was not impressed. The characters showed promise but the story line was not strong."
"254",5,"  Watched the movie last Saturday and it was amazing. It wasn't like a depressing teen angsty bullshit. It was predominantly a rom-com. It contains hilarious digs at social norms and, despite that, remains to be very relatable. The titular protagonist, Simon, is precious with heart-warming characteristics. His quest to find Blue is as frustrating as it is exciting. He takes us through falling in love with each person that could potentially be Blue, and make us fall out of love upon finding that they aren't. Each person that he thought was Blue was, at first, portrayed to be amazing and infallible as they are in the eyes of those falling in love for the first time. But gradually normalizes each of them upon realization that they aren't Blue. Anyways, for the most part, it was amazing and heart-warming. I strongly recommend it as an alternative to all of the heart-pounding movie releases in the next 6 months."
"255",5,"  The BEST MOVIE EVER CREATED. I cried 3 times, and as soon as it comes on ITunes, I am buying it. And then will continue to watch it at least once a week <3"
"256",5,"  A very important movie that was very well executed!"
"257",5,"  Best movie yet!!!! Cant wait until this movie goes on DVD. I have already read the book. Cant wait to go see this movie again and again!!!!!!"
"258",5,"  Cannot wait. Seeing it tomorrow. Following the botched rollout of one of the finest LGBT films ever (""Call Me By Your Name""), it's nice to see a studio have the confidence that audiences will come see a movie about a gay character."
"259",5,"  Phenomenal and long overdue. You leave the theater feeling warm and thankful."
"260",5,"  It was the best movie ive ever seen in awhile"
"261",5,"  I love Love, Simon. Nick Robinson is vulnerable and authentic as 17 year-old Simon, who ""comes out"". Director Greg Berlanti makes this more than the landmark teen gay love story. Love, Simon is about daring to fall in love and being free to be. That is a world we all deserve.Simon eloquently says, ""I'm still me..."" Truth. Love, Simon has such beauty and poignancy. Perhaps, someday what makes Love, Simon so revolutionary will no longer be so."
"262",5,"  Beautiful, charming, needed."
"263",5,"  Great movie that is long overdue. Laughed, cried, cheered. Absolutely love it."
"264",5,"  a bit Juvenile for an older audience but a movie well worth seeing. The next Generations coming of age story to see."
"265",5,"  This is a great John Hughes-style movie. The characters are great and Nick Robinson is fantastic, playing everything just right. Some really good scenes in here that really givee you the feels. Remember, it is a teenage rom-com, but its done very very well."
"266",3.5,"  Solid teen film with heart and comedy. To me it looks to be inspired by John Hughes films of the 80's."
"267",4,"  Just a funny, sweet, relatable, very enjoyable movie."
"268",5,"  Absolutely amazing! Made me cry, and laugh. As someone who is queer this movie was so validating in the absolute best way possible and it was super refreshing to see and only upbeat movie about gay characters."
"269",5,"  Heartwarming, inspiring story. Well done and we need more films like that."
"270",5,"  Saw it last Saturday night, It is incredible! I will see it again this weekend and buy it when it is released!"
"271",3.5,"  Love, Simon is an enjoyable watch that will tug at your heart strings and cause you to root for the confused and conflicted Simon. His struggle to maintain an image, open up to change, and stand by himself and his identity is relatable to nearly everyone and was handled well, albeit not perfectly."
"272",4,"  I enjoyed the emotional journey. Superb acting and directing. This was really well done."
"273",5,"  This could very well be the best movie ever made about homosexuality.SPOILER ALERTThe concept of being able to breathe now sums up what it's like coming out. The film's producers really made this film authentic."
"274",4.5,"  From Disney Channel and ABC sitcoms to the critically acclaimed works of Juno, Boyhood, and Lady Bird, it's no secret that ""coming-of-age"" stories are everywhere. Yet there's a reason why so few TV shows and films actually get high school right. Such a task requires a skillful balance of relatable characters and a plot that is as believable as it is entertaining. Young adult years are a time of self-discovery, uncomfortable change, and figuring out how the world works, as well as our roles in the process. What I loved most about this film was that it tackled social isolation, inter-generational mentorship, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and acceptance of differences without seeming woefully melodramatic. Some call it a milestone for diversity and inclusion in this genre of film, and on some level, I have to agree. I felt every emotion portrayed onscreen - good, bad, and everything in between - to a depth that I had not anticipated, and I left the theatre both pleasantly surprised and anxious to experience it all over again. It was ultimately a story that, due to its refreshing honesty, worked its various elements cohesively from start to finish. I think we have a young adult classic in the making."
"275",5,"  Such a good movie! Really glad stories like this are being told on the big screen."
"276",5,"  Very beautiful movie"
"277",5,"  An astoundingly accurate depiction of teenage coming out, like, seriously. This is such an important milestone for queer kids everywhere. Someone like them is at the forefront of a movie and not just a one-off side character. There's human development, change, and realness, along with relaxing comedy when you need it. Coming out is hard, and it's something many teens struggle in doing each day. It was high time we finally had a movie that they can see themselves in. That I can see myself in. Love, Simon will forever be a part of my movie collection, and remain a testament to what film can be for people like me."
"278",5,"  Love, Simon Dir: Greg Berlanti Synopsis: 17 year old Simon has conflicts with himself about coming out to his friends and family about being gay. He discovers someone else at his school is also conflicted. They become email pen pals without knowing one another and eventually fall in love. Now first and foremost I must say that when I watch films, I watch them for what they are. I'm not biased toward any particular genre obviously with the exception of superhero films ?? So with that being said this was a superb and exceptional romance if I had to classify its genre. It was wonderfully filmed and the storyline was long enough to keep you curious as to who Simon's mystery pen pal is. If you have seen ""13 Reasons Why"" you will recognize a few familiar faces. For young actors and actresses they did a fantastic job at keeping the story engaged along with the veteran actors Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner. To be perfectly honest there really isn't anything I can pick out of this film to complain about. No dry points and the film progresses quick enough that you don't lose where the story is going. You get the primary story of Simon and his pen pal, trying to figure who the mystery person is and you get a side story that meshes into the primary so that it still plays a pivotal role in completing the film. The ending was unexpected which was nice considering you believe that the mystery person is solved 3/4 of the way through. Loved the film would def recommend a watch if you are into romance genre. 5/5 ???????? for the genre"
"279",4.5,"  A special movie for the sole purpose of existing in the first place. Director Berlanti and his team do a wonderful job of taking the familiar coming-of-age teen genre and providing a fresh perspective. What results is a movie full of humor, warmth, honesty and touching gravity. The cast is terrific and helps bring this story to vibrant life. The spirit of John Hughes is alive in this movie and updates it to 2018 to allow inclusion to be respsented. Highly recommneded."
"280",3.5,"  Love, Simon is filled with humor-in its characters, dialogue, and situations-but it doesn't sacrifice emotional depth. The two work in tandem."
"281",5,"  Saw on a mystery screening and loved it! Loved Simon and Leah?s (13 reasons why) characters. Just a great feel good film with a great story."
"282",5,"  this movie was really really good i would keep watching it over and over again, but i think that it would be a better tv show then movie and i asked some friends if they thought that same thing and they said yes so im just letting you know that i think it would be a better TV show then movie im my opinion, but it was a really really good movie too"
"283",5,"  I recommend this movie to everyone. If you have not seen it yet, go watch it now! Definitely worth your time. Trust me."
"284",5,"  An amazing coming of age story, with genuine heart, an adorable and realistic story, and moments that I'm fairly sure may have come directly from my own high school experience."
"285",5,"  This is one of those rare cases where even though it's very different from the book, it's still absolutely incredible. I cried so hard watching this and as soon as it was over I wanted to go back in and watch it again."
"286",5,"  Absolutely loved it!!!! Definitely recommend it !!! Had me in tears, and I walked away with warmth in my heart , and hope that maybe it will be easier in the near future for us all to open our eyes and hearts to individuality! Love is deserved by all, and our world will be such a better place when we realize and accept that!!!"
"287",3.5,"  Wish we had movies like this when I was in High School. It's like a John Hughes flick. 3.5/5"
"288",5,"  Such a sweet film. It hits the hallmarks of a classic romantic comedy. More please."
"289",5,"  Incredible, inspiring movie to everyone, especially to anyone thats LGBTQ+. Love, Simon inspired me to come out as gay. I strongly recommend everyone, no matter your sexuality, to see this movie."
"290",4.5,"  Super cute movie. Loved that being gay was accepted by his family and friends, so different than my experience. Does my heart good to see this movie do so well and show that love is love!!!"
"291",5,"  It was such a wonderful movie. It showed the struggles of teenage hood, but also how hard it can be to be different then others and how important it is to how wonderful friends and bonds. I hope this movie continues to inspire gay people to tell their friends and family and realize that it is okay to be gay."
"292",3,"  Cute movie only, with an emphasis on CUTE. A little too sugary sweet and manipulative for my tastes. The character Martin is so horrible that I can not even fathom the other kids giving him even a chance at being a member of their group. And Simon shows an all too easily lost set of ethics towards his friends. I'm a gay adult now, and grew up in the sticks of southern Indiana, so I know what it's like to try and hide one's sexual orientation, but I just don't buy that a true friend would so easily con his friends. So, to me, that aspect of the movie did not ring true. Also, although the scene with Josh Duhamel (the dad) was, once again, CUTE/SWEET, I thought that Duhamel's attempt at ""crying"" was just awful. He's a very pretty man but not an overly great actor. This movie seems to be billed as a teen rom-com and that's what I'd say it comes off as successfully. Just kind of a teen fluff piece more apropos as an after-school movie."
"293",5,"  FREAKING AMAZING. AS A GAY TEEN, THIS REALLY HIT HOME AND I CRIED SO HARD. THIS MOVIE MEANS SO MUCH TO ME OH MY. AMAZING. I LOVED IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Seriously though, I can not thank everything enough for how amazing this movie was, and how much it made me feel. It's wonderful. Thank you so much."
"294",4,"  A very well written and acted gay coming of age film. Enough humor to make it work."
"295",5,"  As a fan of the book (Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda), I was both thrilled and nervous to see the movie. I got my tickets for the Thursday night premiere, and the first thing I noticed was the composition of the audience in the theatre. Excluding me, every single group of people in attendance had a preteen or teenager (many of them in rainbow shirts or wearing rainbow bracelets) and what appeared to be their parents or grandparents. I could have cried. Have you ever been in a movie with LGBTQ teens or their allies and their parents? What a world we live in.The movie was sweet, touching, hilarious, moving -- I could give you a thousand similar words. What struck me most, however, were the changes made from the original source material. I realized halfway through the movie that the book was the gay rom-com that LGBTQ teens wanted... but the movie was the story that we all needed. There's one scene that was added from the book between Simon and his mother that will give closure to every one of us who had a rough coming out experience. My last comment about this movie: I'm a very stoic movie-goer who doesn't tend to laugh out loud or cry. My eyes were burning with tears at parts. I burst out laughing multiple times. I actually screamed in a cheer at one point at the end. People in the theatre applauded. Please see this movie. Not only is it very well-made, but I have faith that this is going to be the key to truly bringing LGBTQ romance to mainstream movies."
"296",3,"  Attractive young actors who are mostly boring and more mature and have more common sense than the adults in the film. The adults have all the funny lines. In essence it seems like cute made for TV movie that is interesting but just barely. You can definitely wait for this to come to DVD, doesn't have the script or plot or actor's chops of 'Call me BY your name'. But still a decent film."
"297",5,"  Much better film than I thought it would be. left you guessing as to who his secret love interest was."
"298",5,"  Great movie for the whole family. Funny too"
"299",5,"  Love, Simon was an amazing drama that told it's story in a way that anyone could understand. As Simon struggles with being himself, he leaves the audience on their guard. Even if one can not relate, Love, Simon still teaches great lessons of love, honesty, friendship, acceptance, and to always be yourself.Overall, Love, Simon tells the brighter side of coming out.Although there is some bad language in the film, it is not too much and I would recogmend this film for children as well as adults."
"300",5,"  It was so overwhelming. Made me cry for several times while watching. A good mix of comedy and romance. It is a must see movie! Bring your friends and family!"
"301",5,"  Screw anyone that said this movie didn't need to be made, that lgbtq kids (and adults) didn't need this. Love, Simon IS IMPORTANT!"
"302",5,"  As a gay young adult this movie is everything I wanted when I was younger. It hit homes to both the trials and also the joys of being part of the LGBTQ+. I cried, I laughed, and for the first time in a long time I felt as if I emotionally connected with a movie once again. Love, Simon is simply a landmark movie, and I pray more of the same good content is on its way."
"303",1,"  i did not love simon"
"304",5,"  LOVE, SIMON is my favourite movie of 2018 so far, it is a heart-warming light-hearted, but deeply profound, love story I will cherish for the rest of my life. If there were movies like this when I was Simon's age just think how far the world would have evolved by now.Full review is now up on Salty Popcorn."
"305",4.5,"  Such a funny, moving and heartwarming feelgood-movie!"
"306",0.5,"  Nobody wants to watch a faggot come out of the closet. Shit film about the disease homosexuality"
"307",5,"  Beautiful. Will change and has changed so many lives. So important"
"308",5,"  Potentially life-saving-gay teens still try to kill themselves at rates 6-8x that of straight teens-but carries this message with grace and poignancy, as well as delightful moments of hilarity. Almost a perfect teen movie, fun and engaging but with an important message. As it happens, my 15-year old son came out to me three days ago and today we saw ""Love, Simon"". He loved it and found it affirming, and I have never been so thankful for a movie. I'm sure I'll see it again and would recommend it for parents and teens in our situation, but also for those who just want to understand and develop more empathy and compassion for LGBT teens."
"309",0.5,"  This is a awefully normal high school show with unbearable cinematography and editing. I could say it is a cheap good looking film, but it definitely doesn't deserve 91 on rotten tamatoes. It gives me the feeling of just ""using"" the tag of gay to make a high school film. This movie is really without any asethetics apart from politically right."
"310",5,"  Beautiful, inspiring film that is funny, touching, sad, and deeply moving. Such an important and necessary film during this time that offers all kinds of representation. Try to excuse this as a meaningless romcom all you want?- there is so much more depth and meaning to this, and is quite literally inspiring thousands to come out. It?s been long overdue that the LGBTQ+ community had a cute, uplifting romcom!!! Absolutely loved it & really encourage you to support this project."
"311",5,"  Great Book. Great Movie. Loved every second."
"312",4,"  A great story about a young man coming out and the pressures of being a gay teenager in today's society. Simon (Nick Robinson) is an average teen that has a pretty great life. His mother (Jennifer Garner) and father (Josh Duhamel) are very supportive and loving. He has a sister that he actually likes and loves. His closest friends are also very great people too we have his two childhood friends Leah (Katherine Langford) and Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) have known him since he was 5 years old. Their newest addition to the crew is Abby (Alexandra Shipp) who is pretty damn cool. Pretty perfect life right? Well...Simon as you may have known from the trailer is gay, but hasn't told anyone. The film follows Simon through his senior year of high school where he begins to email a mysterious person from school calling themselves ""Blue"" who announces on a school board that he himself is a closeted gay teenager as well. Simon immediately has a connection with Blue and spends the year trying to find out who Blue is while also dealing with his own eventual coming out to the ones he loves the most. First and foremost Nick Robinson did a fantastic job here. I really cared for his characters and I enjoyed the chemistry between his friends and him throughout the film. It's very believable...to a point and I'll get to that in a moment. The movie has some great moments that are reminiscent of a teen coming of age tale, but with the obvious twist. When Simon eventually comes out to his family I found it was some incredible and touching scenes. The gripe I have is that the movie is still very predictable. From the first ten minutes I was able to figure out how the film would end. Blue's identity for me was a complete mystery though and I enjoyed that eventual payoff. The movie gets a bit too convenient for the last 20 minutes that I didn't enjoy as much and even had some seemingly forced dialogue (looking at you Abby and Nick awkward dialogue). Overall, still a great film that I hope people give a chance regardless of your sexual orientation. It's a great coming of age movie and a great look into the life of someones life that's different than the supposed ""norm."""
"313",5,"  Will be a amazing movie"
"314",1,"  Expected more than was delivered."
"315",4,"  This movie touches the heart! VERY accurate!"
"316",4.5,"  I saw someone else describe this movie as ""woke John Hughes,"" and that's pretty much perfect. Love the cast, it's a solid adaptation of a truly wonderful book, and it balances seriousness and humor so well. Already it means a lot to so many people. Definitely one to see."
"317",5,"  Love, Simon was just what I had hoped for in a mainstream gay movie. I wish it had come out when I was younger and still dealing with being closeted because this movie is so special. Everyone should see this very sweet and heartfelt film. Definitely shed a few tears at the more painful moments as I remembered my own emotions of coming out and not knowing who I was. Absolutely recommend for everyone, a great movie that I'll cherish having watched."
"318",5,"  The tagline says it all. Everyone deserves their own love story."
"319",4,"  While this movie is filled with ""Who does that in real life?!"" moments, it also has that believable aspect to it as well. Love, simon is that one movie that has many quotes to live by but also has many quotes that would never come out of a regular every day person's mouth. while we live in a day and age of, oh so you're gay, cool, this movie fits in with teen boys and girls that feel out of place and afraid to let their true self be shown. we all have that moment of not fitting in. even myself who is no longer in their teens. having moments that could easily be slapped into a hallmark original movie, love, simon has the ability to attract crowds of all types and is the movie that is much needed in a time when social media is used mainly for attention and who will get the most likes. love yourself and have strength in who you are. that is the ultimate message in this one. overall, love, simon is worth a watch."
"320",5,"  My life when I was in high school!!! Everyone van relate"
"321",4.5,"  ""Love, Simon"" (PG-13, 1:50) is a romantic comedy-drama directed by Greg Berlanti and written by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, based on the award-winning 2015 YA novel ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" by first-time author Becky Albertalli. The story centers on a closeted gay teenage boy who has to juggle a variety of interpersonal drama related to his obsession with keeping his secret.Simon (Nick Robinson), as his voiceover at the beginning of the film tells us, has a ""perfectly normal life""... except for that one big secret. He has loving parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) and a little sister (Talitha Bateman) whom he actually likes. Simon's closest friends (who ride with him to school every morning) are childhood friends Leah (Katherine Langford) and Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and, the newest member of the group, transfer student Abby (Alexandra Shipp). None of these people know Simon is gay and he wants to keep it that way... until he decides that he's ready to tell them. But external influences intrude. Simon sees a social media post by someone in his school who claims to be a closeted gay teenage boy at Simon's school, but doesn't identify himself by name, just referring to himself as ""Blue"". Blue's message includes a Gmail address, so Simon sets up a new account and begins corresponding with Blue, using the name ""Jacques"". As they encourage each other and cautiously begin sharing a few details about their personal lives, a socially awkward classmate named Martin (Logan Miller) learns about the Emails, makes copies of them and threatens to ""out"" Simon, unless Simon does something for him. Martin forces Simon to help him get together with Abby, which leads Simon to manipulate his closest friends, while hoping that Martin doesn't expose his secret and trying to figure out who Blue is. Simon has a lot of balls in the air and anyone can see they can't stay up there forever.""Love, Simon"" is an excellent romance which you don't have to be gay to enjoy. The main character isn't as tortured as those in ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Moonlight"", but not as carefree as those in ""Call Me By Your Name"". Simon is portrayed as happy and relatively well-adjusted, but is unsure about when or how to take the next step in being who he is. He's a good person who, unfortunately, gets off track and tries to solve his one big problem by acting selfishly. This movie's main point seems to be, as many people learn in their personal or professional (or political) lives, hiding the truth is usually more harmful than telling the truth. It's a lesson which rings true, as shown in the experiences of characters which feel genuine, in a movie that is entertaining and heartfelt. After all, regardless of sexual identity, as the film suggests, everyone deserves a great love story. And every cinematic love story deserves a script, a cast and a director as good as that of ""Love, Simon"". ""A"""
"322",5,"  You'll fall in love with Simon and his story."
"323",5,"  I loved this movie so, so much!"
"324",5,"  Finally an amazingly normal movie about kids growing up today and dealing with sexual orientation decisions. No one could hate this movie or the inspiring message - go see Love, Simon this week - best money spent at the movies in a very long time."
"325",5,"  I loved this movie. I loved the story. I loved the writing. I loved the soundtrack."
"326",5,"  A atunningly beautiful movie that has meant so much to my friends and I, and the first movie ever to make me cry multiple times. Amazing soundtrack. The first good gay high school movie AND the first movie with a gay main character from a major film company? Instantly iconic."
"327",4.5,"  Honestly loved this movie so much! It was hilarious, heartwarming, and extremely well acted throughout. Can't recommend it enough - there needs to be more movies like this. 4.5/5"
"328",5,"  I felt more loved watching this movie than I have in a very long time."
"329",5,"  Great movie. Amazing comedy and scenes that will make you tear up. In all great film must see."
"330",5,"  As someone who is gay, it's awesome to see people like me be in the forefront of a big budget hollywood movie. This was the first time I truly related to a movie geared to people my age, especially with him struggling to come out to friends and family. It honestly felt so refreshing to watch a cheesy teen romcom that's not about your typical straight couple. I didn't even realize how much I needed something like this until I started to watch it, and it just hit me that there's almost nothing out there in mainstream media that centers around a same-sex couple. This movie is monumental to me and many other people, and I cannot even express how much it meant to have a gay teenager at the center of it. This is the first time I've felt represented in the media, and will hopefully pave the way for more stories of lgbt people in mainstream tv and movies."
"331",4.5,"  Love, Simon is not the greatest movie ever made, but it doesn't try to be, nor does it need to be. It's more personal, more intimate, and delivers a good story with the help of some great actors and a handful of powerful scenes. Where many LGBT-centric movies feature tired jokes, shallow characters, and dumb stereotypes, Love, Simon brings a refreshing and heartfelt depth to it that will reach out to people everywhere. I think many people of all ages could stand to see this movie, and maybe learn something from it. Love, Simon may not be incredibly innovative or jaw-dropping, but it does a great job of showing what many LGBT kids see, think, and experience while living in the closet. Highly recommended from a bona fide gay person."
"332",5,"  This is a movie that I truly believe everyone should see. It changed the way that I viewed the world, and is such an important modern coming of age story. The theater was packed, and my friends and I laughed and cried. Everyone in the theater jumped out of their seats and started clapping and cheering throughout the movie. I feel so lucky to be living in a time when movies are being put out like this, and I know that this will change so many lives. This is a must see for everyone, and is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen."
"333",5,"  The greatest movie of all time"
"334",5,"  one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. I laughed and cried throughout the whole film. I would see this 100 times if I possibly could. The acting is phenomenal, the story is beautiful, and just the whols thing altogether is really a masterpiece. The LGBT community needs more films like this."
"335",0.5,"  Just another stereotypical Lgbt movie that gives away the main plotline in the movie clips, without even starring any decent actors that you would recognize. Don't waste your time on this crap and go see Black panther instead, so that you don't waste your money, time, and love for the cinema."
"336",5,"  This movie wins for me in almost every category. The script is crisp, the acting is strong, the jokes are funny, the situations are real, and the representation is there. A cast that includes people of color and a few LGBT actors, and comes from such a dynamic place makes the movie feel genuine. Each emotional instance of the movie felt real, it was actual representation, not dramatization. As a gay teen who has experienced the same discrimination, the same issues with coming out, and the same drama with being frightened and worried that people wouldn't be accepting, this movie was truly touching."
"337",5,"  I laughed. I cried. I thought. And more importantly, I related. Love, Simon is by far a step forward in the right direction."
"338",3.5,"  This movie was totally cute! I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The acting is strong, and the humor is surprisingly current and refreshing. Is it groundbreaking work? Hardly. Is it a fun coming-of-age, popcorn flick with a great message? You got it, Simon! #LoveWins #IGotMyMoviePassesWorth"
"339",5,"  I loved it. I brought a friend the night before it officially opened and she had no idea anything about the movie. The second Simon said he was gay in the opening her jaw hit the floor and she almost started crying. It is so inspirational and relatable. Go see this movie!"
"340",5,"  Heartfelt, real, witty, and connecting on all levels of what it means to be an adolescent coming of age."
"341",5,"  Genuinely entertaining; with light hearted humor helping to drive the story along"
"342",5,"  I loved this movie. It was great to see a flawed, yet likeable gay teen character. Better yet, it was nice to see Black and mixed gay characters in a major studio movie. The story was sweet, yet also engaging. The John Hughes tones were clear, yet the message was even better."
"343",5,"  The movie was amazing!!!!!"
"344",4,"  Enjoyable, but no gay vibe from any character."
"345",5,"  Great movie to portray how even in the best scenarios, it can still be difficult to come out to those you love and trust. hopefully this movie will start conversations among friends and family, and empower those who are in the closet to come out and be open about who they are."
"346",5,"  Saw it twice this weekend...it is fantastic...please go see it!"
"347",4.5,"  I just saw ""Love, Simon"" on its premiere release day, and the movie was absolutely great! The story was well-made, a lot of the characters and the acting were great, and I'm not going to lie you guys this film almost got me emotional. As for the negatives, the pacing was a bit fast throughout the first half, and I hated one of the characters because he was a complete dick who had absolutely no reason to be that way. However, I love this film, and this film definitely serves as an inspiration to the LGBTQ community. And as a LGBTQ supporter, I am inspired because this film helps me and other kids in these types of situations think, ""What will my friends and family think of me if I came out? Will they accept me for who I am, or will I forever be alone because they don't want me to be who I am, and that is myself."" Overall, I give it a 9/10."
"348",4.5,"  Cathartic and beautiful and very well done. Insightful and clever."
"349",5,"  Endearing, wonderful,joyful."
"350",0.5,"  Love, Simon who just goes to the movies to go watch this shit like this is worst then Disney like seriously ?"
"351",5,"  FABULOUS !!! Love ""the 1975"" music !!!!! ALL of the movie !!"
"352",5,"  Beautiful in all aspects. It may not be exactly the book, but it still carries its full charm along."
"353",5,"  the greatest thing ive ever experienced"
"354",3.5,"  director Greg Berlanti of TV fame makes a movie about something socially relevantbeing gay is tough enough particularly when you have to keep it a secret not just to yourself but others around youit's a scary thing not being who you really are or how much could change after you reveal yourself to the worldwill everyone be okay with it or dislike you for it?that's what Nick Robinson as Simon is struggling with; he has a great life from his family to his friends, the only thing holding him back is that he's gaythere's also a blog where he writes to someone anonymous about his lifestyle so for him it's a relief knowing he's not the only one with something to hideRobinson is excellent In the role next to supporting players by Alexandra Shipp, Jennifer Garner, Logan Miller, and Josh DuhamelBerlanti makes a film not just for the gay community and even though it doesn't fully emcompass the lifestyle he still says anyone can fall in loveyou don't have to be straight to have a happy ending, nobody wants to live in a world where you can't be who you are truly, and it's easy to feel cut off and isolated if you have no one to share your storyin this genre of coming-of-age tales more stories like this need to be presented since there are so many out there who may be going through the same ordealsthe young actors are really good but I do wish the plot went in a different direction, it's one of those cases where the trailers lied and this does have the makings of a made-for-TV productionstill, it's a big gamechanger that needs to exist more these days"
"355",1,"  The actor is not even gay. Enough said."
"356",5,"  Loved it. Very heartfelt and hit home for me. I wish more films were like this."
"357",4.5,"  A great movie! Honest characters and story telling with some great actors. The storyline worked so well and stayed pretty true to the book with some tweaks of course. Definitely a movie worth seeting at least once, for others probably 2 or 3 times!"
"358",4,"  Extremely appealing coming-of-age story is well-acted and directed, with an emphasis on avoiding controversy."
"359",5,"  The movie is good. I cried a lot. My daughter Angel loves the movie. Just watched Love Simon five minutes ago. I will buy the movie on Vudu."
"360",5,"  Love, Simon was such an amazing movie. I love this cast and the movie was well thought out. It was touching in many ways, & relatable to a lot of issues that going on."
"361",5,"  Love, Simon was everything I'd hoped it would be. It was sweet and romantic but was also realistic about the struggles of coming out. I recommend this to anyone and everyone and think movies like this are vital in today's sciety."
"362",5,"  Great movie. Definitely captures the coming out experience well!"
"363",4,"  Love, Simon is a step closer to a hopefully peaceful and accepting society; however, it's fluff. It does help to normalize and show the homosexual perspective, though it struggles to show depth and pain. I will admit I shed a few tears, but I also shed a few tears simply because Simon was more accepted than how most LGBTQ+ teens are today. It's beautiful, and a milestone, but I need another mainstream teen movie that goes into the suffering of how we're really treated, rather than the glitter."
"364",4,"  Secret weapon: Natasha Rothwell. Now sit your ass down and watch the movie."
"365",5,"  What a fantastic film!"
"366",5,"  Great movie, funny and emotional."
"367",5,"  I am a 55 year old gay man and I just saw a re-run if my life - best therapy ever. Thank you for making this movie"
"368",3,"  Cute. Would?ve been more appropriate about 10 years ago but a sweet movie"
"369",4.5,"  A fantastic movie, One of the few that have made my cry."
"370",5,"  This was such an amazing movie, my best friend and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. 10/10"
"371",5,"  I have seen this movie twice. Once at a free screening and once just yesterday. This is a great movie! Have there been other better coming of age coming out movies? Of course but the very fact that this movie is playing nationwide really puts a great spotlight on our culture. There are a lot of lessons to learn in this movie for all kinds of people. I think that the most important one is that who you are attracted to is only one facet of your life. He did everything that every other teenage boy did and the only difference is that he happens to be gay. I think that this movie will help a lot of young people who are having a hard time coming to terms with their sexuality. To top it off. It's a very warmhearted and funny movie! I am really looking forward to owning it on bluray down the road as it is sure to be a cult classic!"
"372",5,"  Incredible film! Hopefully the first of many to come."
"373",5,"  Great movie dealing with real life issues presented be believable characters,...and a sprinkle of humor. I will see again."
"374",5,"  Love,Simon Is an amazing moving that is going to inspire and help so many young kids out their come to terms and realize who they are. This movie is so powerful and so accurate to what it's like for a good handful of LGBT people and I'm so happy and proud to be alive to see this kind of movie be played in theaters.. I would have never of dreamed of seeing this day..All my life I've dealt with the same and similar things that took place in this movie and I am so happy that someone out there who is young is gonna see this movie and their whole life is gonna change because of it.. I wish I could have had a movie out like this when I was a child because things would have been a lot different in my process of not only coming out to others but to myself. Love, Simon is truly a remarkable film and one to definitely see no matter if your Gay, Straight, Bi, Lesbian, Trans, etc. This is the perfect representation of how it feels to be someone who is LGBTQ and what we go through in life. I couldn't be more proud.Thank you to everyone who put their time and hearts into this movie. You all are amazing and this movie is truly going to change the world.Love, Roman"
"375",5,"  Wonderful movie about acceptance, has very positive messages. There's a part in the movie where the mom is giving a speech and it's extremely moving and heartfelt - brought my own mother to tears!"
"376",5,"  This movie was amazing to watch with my friends. I definitely recommend watching it when you can and if you need inspiration on how to overcome something's. This story has surely and most definitely opened peoples eyes to kids like simon's lives. I hoped you can open your mind to different things like others and give this movie a shot."
"377",4.5,"  GREAT FEEL GOOD MOVIE. It doesn't follow the typical love story, but Simon weaves thru his life to find his true love."
"378",5,"  Super well done, entertaining, believable. Two thumbs up"
"379",4.5,"  It's not perfect, by any means, but it touches ground that has not been touched before by movies of its type."
"380",5,"  This film was an amazing look into a part of life that so few must endure. Of course it was humerous, well-written, and featured actors who were brilliant to watch. More importantly, though, this movie portrayed a terrifying time in someone's life without cheapening the story with cliches or pandering to any one group. It was beautiful in its simplicity, and extremely moving. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone. I look forward to purchasing multiple copies of the Blu Ray when it is released, after I've seen it a few more times, that is."
"381",5,"  Sixteen Candles for 2018- Loved this movie."
"382",5,"  This movie CHANGED MY LIFE"
"383",5,"  Abosutely love this movie. From the casting, character development all the way to the music, this film has been long over due."
"384",5,"  literally best movie i have ever seen. all other movies are bad by comparison. this movie will save lives!!!"
"385",4.5,"  For the majority i enjoyed the movie extensively. they got a lot of things right in terms of how it is to be gay and that not all gay men are raging flamboyants, its not always obvious. just looking through simon's eyes seeing how confusing it is to figure out whether someone liked him or not simply because he was unsure if they even swung that way gave a lot of insight. There were a few things i wasn't agreeing with because in a sense the movie gave him a fairy tale ending which isn't always the case. the way high school felt also wasn't very realistic 100% but regardless still enjoyable to watch the movie."
"386",5,"  I did not expect this movie to hit so close to home, but it did and I am speechless. This is the movie that we deserve"
"387",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing! It's a wonderful coming-of-age story that leaves you feeling happier when you've left it. I've already bought my ticket to see it for the second time, and am planning to see it a third. Definitely watch this film!!"
"388",5,"  Not your typical highschool drama. Highschool is actually realistic and personally relatable to me. The acting and writing is very well done. Enjoyable not just for members of the gay community. Strongly recommend."
"389",5,"  Love, Simon was good. Was so happy to see all the people at the movie and all the girls get gitty and teary eyed. A lot of the themes portrayed in the movie we have all been through, and just remembering all of it. %[%spoiler alert%]The nerves, the anxiety, the did I do something right or did I just make a terrible mistake. Someone else holding knowing your secret and having to come out when your not ready all of this hit home. I did get a little teary eyed. We need more movies like this!"
"390",5,"  I loved this movie so much it made me cry and laugh could relate to it so much. Only wish it came out earlier"
"391",4.5,"  This is a groundbreaking movie that is more than just that title. The movie itself is very lighthearted, and among the best teen rom coms. The plot is good and the mystery is well done. Nick Robinson shines as Simon Spier, showing what it is truly like to be a closeted teen in modern days. His struggles are not with his sexuality, but in his fear of how the people he loves will change once they learn his secret. That was my favorite part of the movie, showing that being in the closet doesn't mean that you are weak, but that it's just trying to figure out the timing and not wanting to possibly have to let go of the good things you already have. I loved this movie, it is long overdue and very well done. I hope that there are more movies that follow in the steps of Love, Simon. Thank you for this one."
"392",5,"  A truly amazing and heartwarming movie. As a young gay adult who struggled coming out to friends and family, 'Love, Simon' brought many flashbacks of pain and joy, heartaches and pure moments of happiness. I clapped, I laughed, and I cried with the entire movie theater. Thank you to the cast and crew who brought to life such an inspiring story. Step outside this dark and narrow closet of shame and repression. Be who you are. Be happy. Live."
"393",5,"  Read the book. LOVED! Saw the movie. LOVED! A mainstream movie with gay lead that doesn't end in disaster or sadness? Long overdue. I only wish my teenage self could have read the book/seen the movie. It would have changed my life. Gay. Straight. Somewhere in between. All will love this movie."
"394",4.5,"  I heard great things about the book when it first came out, but never got the chance to read it, so I knew very little going in. But Love, Simon, supposedly the first LGBT teen romance released by a major studio, is a massive win. Charming, sweet, heartfelt, and funny without being insensitive. Some of the big jokes were released in the trailer, but there were plenty of other memorable lines. The story is modern and new, but at the same time has this classic feel. And it does an excellent job at capturing the spirit and struggles of teenagers in 2018.Nick Robinson as Simon is a star. Subtle, but bright nonetheless. He is endearing and instantly lovable--it is impossible not to root for Simon and this great love story he wants and so desperately deserves.My only complaint is that there were elements that were extremely predictable. I could see some of the ""twists"" coming almost from the beginning. But with the added mystery element to the story, the film is still exciting and interesting enough to keep you engaged and on your toes until the very end.This movie feels like a breath of fresh air. I haven't smiled this big walking out of a movie theater in a while. I hope Love, Simon becomes the standard for the teen movies of the future, and major studios continue to release sweet, lovely, wonderful gay teen romances like this one. The world could probably use just a couple more."
"395",5,"  This movie was exceptional. This movie was important. Progress meets entertainment in Love, Simon. I applaud those that took a risk on this film; I wish I could thank them in person. It meant a lot to me personally to see this as a new wide-release film."
"396",5,"  I read the book a bit back and normally hate book to movie adaptations. Normally they get rid of vey important scenes as well just don't portray the books scenes well but Simon and his friends were EVERYTHING they were in the books. Of course some thing could have been better but it was everything I had hoped for and more!"
"397",5,"  I read the book, Simon vs. the Homo Sapien Agenda, and the movie was just as good which never happens. Simon is so adorable. Both of my kids loved it too. Highly recommended!"
"398",5,"  A well done, funny, sweet film. The story of a young man who has a 'secret' he's afraid to share with even his closest friends is well acted brings both laughter and tears. The reaction of his classmates runs the gamut of emotions and the audience is drawn in by the portrayal of this young man's struggle not only with navigating high school but doing so while trying to guard his secret. A very good way to spend an evening."
"399",5,"  Fantastic film. Beautiful characters. A deeply moving and lovely coming of age movie we can all relate to."
"400",5,"  ""Love, Simon"" was a fantastic film, it was so great that I saw the film twice and went back to Walmart to buy a third copy of the book just to show support. I'll admit it had a rushed feeling but I can understand why since they're squeezing so much in a film. Overall it was a great 10/10 film (In my opinion) and it's one of my favorite movies."
"401",4.5,"  IT was great .A MIllion times better than the book hands down. I was very excited being able to view the movie a week early."
"402",5,"  (minor spoilers!) I was skeptical since the movie seemed so overhyped, but it proved me wrong and was very enjoyable and pleasant. The characters seemed real and like real people for the most part, which is important. The plot was very good and had depth to it. And I loved how Simon continued to love Blue no matter who he thought he was, showing that he loved his personality and that who he was didn't matter. Overall it was very good, I loved the emotion in all the characters and thought the movie was really really sweet. It was a very good movie and plan on seeing it again!"
"403",5,"  Heartwarming movie, with lots of charm avout real life. A must see"
"404",4,"  I'll admit before I write this review that I'm somewhat biased towards this movie as a queer teen. At times it can be a bit shallow in regards to character and certain emotional moments, but for the most part, Love, Simon is an emotional love story and hits certain beats that can make almost all audiences feel sympathy for Simon. Truly, Love, Simon is a fantastic movie and has perfected accurate representation."
"405",5,"  Beautiful and hilarious and emotional and magical and relatable and so so important. Queer kids need this. We all need it. My cheeks hurt from smiling so much."
"406",5,"  Was shocked at how packed the theater was. Very good movie"
"407",5,"  this movie was absolutely the best movie i have ever seen, and i think it is so amazing that they have finally made a movie like this."
"408",4.5,"  Excellent script, excellent cast (especially the younger performers) & a winning performance by Nick Robinson make this film shine. Smart, funny, deep."
"409",5,"  I love this movie. It is being compared to Call Me By Your Name but I think a better comparison would be with Ladybird. Love, Simon is as refreshing and wonderful as Ladybird. Nick Robinson and the rest of the cast are outstanding. This film is sweet, funny, positive, and affirming. I wish there had been positive films like this when I was in school."
"410",5,"  A film with heart and a story that is important to tell. With relatable characters, a very well-written script, and groundbreaking treatment of LGBTQ+ characters, ""Love, Simon"" shows that there needs to be more films like it."
"411",5,"  This movie gave me the strength to come out to my dad. It was heartfelt and funny and charming. The whole audience was so involved they laughed and cried and literally clapped at the end. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time."
"412",5,"  I really, really loved this movie. It has a John Huges, 80s feel to it which I really vibed with. Plus the story was really sweet and compelling. I was kinda pissed that another lead LGBT+ character role went to a Straight actor, but the movie's remaining cast is very diverse and fairly queer. I recommend that everyone go see this film. It is just a good movie!"
"413",5,"  'Love, Simon' is a wonderful and amazing experience. Although I wouldn't reccomend it to ages 10 and under, I will definitely reccomend it for everyone else. 'Love, Simon' did a great job at sticking to reality. By that I mean that it didn't go overboard with the potential it has, there is a fine line between too much and just enough for a good coming of age movie, and 'Love, Simon' hits that fine line. The jokes where up to date and very funny. However, it is a tear jerker, not all for sadness, mostly happiness. If you're even thinking of going to see this movie, you should!"
"414",5,"  I was very, very impressed by this movie. I've seen a few teenage coming-of-age films over the years, and this film blew all out those out of the water. To start off, its very well done. From the writing, to the progression of the story, to the acting of the cast, I was very impressed by the overall quality of it. A lot of thought went into trying to render the film believable and honest, and it shows in the final cut. The movie is also surprisingly funny! I was honestly shocked by how funny it was. The dialogue is really witty and any scene involving the drama teacher is absolutely hilarious. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Between the honesty and hilarity of the script, and the effortless flow of the movie, I would highly recommend it. I think everyone can enjoy this film as well. When I saw it the audience ranged from teenage girls to married couples, and everyone seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Bottom line, I highly recommend it!"
"415",5,"  Really enjoyed it. A great start for the previously non-existent genre of gay rom-com; hope to see many more in the future."
"416",5,"  Absolutely incredible. One of the best films I've seen in a VERY long time. I wanted to go watch it again the second that I walked out of the theatre."
"417",5,"  THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE, HUMOROUS & WELL WRITTEN WITH LOVABLE/RELATABLE CHARACTERS!!"
"418",4,"  What a great movie, pleasantly surprised"
"419",5,"  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"420",5,"  IT WAS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD"
"421",5,"  It's a cute love story. Fro. Start to finish it's all in good spirits. Great soundtrack to it. All the actures were great. Good direction. Made me cry ?? which says a lot. For sure one of my favorites."
"422",4.5,"  I really love this movie I thought it wasn't going to be as good as it was I thought it was going to be just a classic romcom but with someone who is gay. Turns out this was much better then I expected, the emotion, the love, just everything was amazing. One of the main things I really liked was how there was no toxic masculinity, the dad had emotion and felt bad that his son had to go through this and he didn't see it sooner to help him. The only toxic masculinity were 2 boys who were called out and I really loved that. I also think the actors do a fantastic job. The only part I didn't like was the end I don't want to give a spoiler but Simon was basically pressuring blue to come out and that was the only part that got me I understand what Simon was doing and I feel for him but at the same time that was not the way to do it tho the ending when he came was so amazing and cute????"
"423",5,"  I cried, laughed, and clapped. What a heartfelt movie"
"424",5,"  Best romantic movie hollywood has made since 'The Notebook!"""
"425",5,"  Love, Simon is so genuine, gentle, and hilarious. I didn't expect to relate, because other than also being gay, my background is so different, but I really connected to Simon, and it was so amazing to finally see someone on screen whose struggles somehow felt connected to mine."
"426",5,"  Love, Simon is absolutely revolutionary. The representation and diversity doesn't feel forced, but works naturally with a brilliant storyline. I can't wait to watch it again, and I hope to see more films like it emerge in the future."
"427",5,"  Hope to see more of these kids."
"428",4.5,"  Was a coming of age beneath the shadows and more real than most teen movies, please go see it just so more movies like it can be made!"
"429",1,"  More hype than anything. If you have seen many LGBT movies before you will think this wasn't even close to being the best LGBT movie."
"430",5,"  Amazing movie. There are times when it's clichÈ but its easy to forget because then you realize the main characters are gay. I felt the clich√© scenes were put on purpose to make sure everyone reaizes that gay or straight the same moments happen in gay relationships as well as straight ones. Scene as simple as going to school and having crushes work in similar ways as heterosexual people, but the only difference is that the self-acceptance and societal acceptance portion gets in the way. I believe the movie does a great job at pointing out that gay people should, can, and do deserve a romantic movie about them without the hypersexualization or self-destruction. This movies show the ugly reality and the hopefulness of being true to yourself in order to set you free."
"431",5,"  Saw this movie last night in Omaha with some friends and it is now one of my favorite movies! I could watch this movie again and again with its funny humor, serious topics, real life issues, relateable subjects, emotional scenes, and scenes that just make you feel happy inside. I would deffiently recommend this movie to anyone out there. You can learn a lot from this movie and it deserves to be watched by many. ??"
"432",2.5,"  After seeing Love, Simon I want a refund on my adolescence because I didn't have a movie that would have so beautifully encapsulated what I was going through. Bravo for this wonderful film."
"433",0.5,"  This was not the best movie. Thought it would be better. Not really into gay movies"
"434",4.5,"  Such a amazing movie."
"435",4,"  I really enjoyed this movie! However, the book, Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens? Agenda by Becky Albertalli is amazing and I highly recommend reading that even if you?ve already seen the movie."
"436",3.5,"  Though not nearly as new as it pretends to be and a bit too ideal at times, Love Simon is a welcome alternative to the scores of overwrought melodramas that tackle the same subject, and successfully achieves palatability due to its warm characters, great cast, and casual humor."
"437",5,"  Speechless! I would watch it over an over again.."
"438",5,"  went to see this with my girlfriend last night. I was fairly skeptical beforehand since, as a nonbinary lesbian, it's beyond obvious when an LGBTQ+ character-- let alone the main character-- is written by a cisgender/heterosexual person. But goddamn. Love, Simon surpasses the stereotypical portrayals of the queer experience with flying colors (yes, pun intended). I never anticipated loving it as much as I do. Truly a brilliant film."
"439",5,"  Great coming of age coming out story."
"440",5,"  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. THIS MOVIE TO DEATH!"
"441",5,"  The underlying message of this movie is something that makes people think. The love story makes people feel. The power of Love, Simon is universal."
"442",5,"  Awesome movie. It covers all of the anxiety of coming out and the fear around it in without dealving intovthe super depressing feelings many of us deal with. Would watch again"
"443",5,"  Amazing Movie, it shows the struggle people have while figuring out their sexuality, but most importantly it shows how the process of ""coming out"" should be normalized. Overall great movie and amazing cast."
"444",5,"  As someone who has never written a film review in my life, Love, Simon has sparked me to do so. It's a film simple in its plot, but hits you on so many emotional levels. It isn't merely a rom-com filled with hysterical roasts and that ""trying-to-figure-things-out"" vibe that often dominates teenage life, but also resonates the struggle of being unaccepted--the excruciating wonder of ""what would happen"" if I came out, ""what if"" they knew this about me, or ""would things change"" if I just let it all out? Both the sense of exasperating dread before coming out and the awkward relief after saying ""I'm gay"" rings true throughout the extent of Love, Simon. Thank you for making this, and let me just say... finally."
"445",5,"  I laughed a lot, I cried a lot, and I absolutely loved this movie."
"446",5,"  Beautiful movie! Laughed, cried, and just loved every part of it! Definitely in the teen romcom genre (in a similar way to The Fault in Our Stars) but a great movie nonetheless."
"447",5,"  I'm a lgbtq+ kid and the representation literally made me shake with emotion. This is now my favorite movie!"
"448",5,"  Amazing, wonderful movie. I loved it."
"449",5,"  I laughed, I cried, I celebrated, I was thankful. It addressed so many of the key issues associated with coming out including the bullying. A film that will help so many young people facing their own ""coming out"" and help them realize it is not really all that scary any more. You still can be you!"
"450",5,"  This movie was SO amazing! The beginning was very lighthearted and featured a bit of ""comedy"" like scenes. I didn't expect to cry as much as I did though! So amazing, definitely recommend"
"451",5,"  Got dragged to this last Saturday. Definitely made for straight people(not necessarily a bad thing) and I enjoyed it way more than I expected. The biggest thing this movie does well is humanize.Nothing too original or different. Great movie for anyone to see no matter their sexual preference."
"452",5,"  This movie was absolutely amazing. If you want a unique yet relatable coming out story, I definitely recommend! It really touches on a subject that mainstream movies never deal with, and in my opinion, there should be more movies like this from now on."
"453",1.5,"  I have waited for this kind of movie for years. As a gay high schooler, I had really high hopes for this. It had some good parts. But it was written for a straight audience. I never felt myself within the character, despite Simon and I being almost the exact same person. I cried with disappointment on the ride home than I did while watching the movie I'm not saying that this movie isn't for anyone, it serves as a great stepping stone for straight people to understand the struggles of coming out. But that's the issue. It's for straight people. Not the gays who have waited for movies like this since the dawn of time."
"454",5,"  Love Simon was the Gay Romcom we all deserved. As an absolute, fellow queer myself I hav meassive respect and appreciation for what they did. The score was beautiful, the characters were complex, interesting and, for the most part, lovable. The story was absolutely brilliant and so realistically gay. Simon is not just his coming out story,Simon is Simon and he just happens to be gay. I know kids will see this and be able to know ""I'm okay. I'm going to be okay."" I hope every questioning, or queer, or LGBT+ child gets to see this movie and see themselves in it. Perhaps, if I had had such realistic and well made representation in my childhood I would have figured out I was gay a lot sooner.I cried, I laughed, I cheered and I hope more movies will see love Soimon as an example to follow and I get more gay romcoms to watch."
"455",4.5,"  Warm, fuzzy film. Really enjoyed it but also don't think it's top notch."
"456",5,"  I'm an out and proud gay teenager, and this is the cliche teen love story movie I feel like I've been waiting for my whole life. Everything resonated with me, from the subaru outback (i have the same car), to the sexual awakening stories (mine was Taylor Swift). This movie made me laugh, made me cry, and I walked out of the theater happier than I've ever been after seeing a movie. 'Love, Simon,' is an amazing movie."
"457",5,"  This is the movie that I needed when I was a young queer teenager."
"458",5,"  It was a really great movie, I highly recommend seeing it"
"459",4.5,"  Great movie, a good balance between funny and serious. A much needed film for the community."
"460",1,"  Made for TV movie. Not sure how it got to the theaters."
"461",4.5,"  A great coming out story. My only complaint was Waffle House scene which was a little over the top and unbelievable. Otherwise, a very true to life story and refreshing in the fact that the majority of the conflict for Simon was internal rather than from an external soure."
"462",3,"  Although it presented an interesting take on the usually stupid and boring teen romance genre as well as some good dialogue, the film's sappy ending and extremely dumb and predictable final reveal prove it has not been able to reach beyond the stereotypes for this kind of movie."
"463",4,"  A romatic comedy that is at time moving but did not break new ground in terms of story telling; it's actually quite predictable. Promoted as a first gay film from a major studio; but regrettably just like Call Me By Your Name the main gay character is played by straight actor."
"464",5,"  Loved this movie! I laughed, cried, and felt myself cheering Siomon on."
"465",5,"  Quintessential coming of age movie for a new generation. It's refreshing and adorable."
"466",5,"  My favorite movies are those that make me laugh AND cry, sometimes at the same time. ""Love, Simon"" did just that. It had many themes that anyone with kids in the middle school to college age-range will benefit from seeing. I came away with, not only the satisfaction of seeing a great movie, but also a number of things I want to talk to my daughter about as she moves into her teen years. The highs and lows of young love, peer pressure, friendships, and more are coming her way."
"467",5,"  beautifully made movie. i hope that future generations looks back on this movie and recognize it as the pivoting point where movies targeted at teenagers became so diverse and accepting. the movie was so beautifully directed, produced, scored, and acted. all young actors and so amazingly talented. this movie is giving so many teenagers and kids the courage to come and be true to themselves and i think that's very hard to achieve by just watching a movie, but that shows just how groundbreaking this movie was. will definitely watch again and again as a pick me up whenever i'm feeling down"
"468",5,"  This hit all the right spots...i laughed, I cried and I want his parents. It made me feel like way back when I used to watch Cant Buy Me Love. This us a new classic for me."
"469",5,"  This movie was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I laughed, cried, and got so into this movie I forgot I was even watching a movie. The acting was so amazing I thought I was there, and the story line has made me want to go out and buy the book, Simon vs the homo sapiens agenda. This movie is a must see for anyone teen and up!"
"470",5,"  I thought it was realistic, funny and heartwarming. All the actors did a great job. The soundtrack was awesome as well. One of the best movies I've seen this year."
"471",5,"  HOLY SHITT!!! That was wonderfull, so heartwarming. I cried throughout the 80% of it. Even if you have read the book, still see the movie they are so different in the completely right ways. I LOVE IT!"
"472",5,"  This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Extremely well written and the acting was amazing. I don't write reviews I usually just tell people about movies when they ask. I am a huge Marvel fan and this movie in my opinion tops Marvel for me. It really pulls you into the movie and hits to home in so many ways. Yes I recommend this movie to everyone."
"473",5,"  Just saw the movie and I loved it. Definitely, recommend!!"
"474",5,"  I am obsessed with this movie, the amount of times I cried because of the jokes or cried because of the situations the characters were in is amazing. The characters feel very real and i was immediately attached to them, Some of the dialogue from the kids is a little cringe (they said outdated slang like HJ and stuff but that's just a nitpick), but for the most part they act pretty realistic. There were parts where I was feeling extremely anxious Because Simon was put in a situation that I (and many other LGBT+ people) are very framiliar with. I know how it felt to be in that exact situation. As a gay man this hit very close to home and I'm sure other many LGBTQ+ people will be able to heavily relate to Simon's journey. This movie will forever be one of my favorites, I can feel it!"
"475",5,"  One of the absolutely BEST movies I have seen in a very, very long time. Perfect mix of LOL funny, heartwarming and touching, amazing writing has edge-of-your-seat twists that have you guessing ""who is it??""up until the very end. This really is a MUST SEE."
"476",5,"  Saw special showing last saturday it was great it felt like a John Hughes movie! ?? ?? ?? I can't wait to see it again."
"477",5,"  One of the greatest love story's of all time. This film is absolutely phenomenal and is a joy to watch."
"478",5,"  This has got to be the first time I thoroughly enjoyed a teen romance movie. The story was sweet, yet it also touched on cyber bullying, the importance of family and friends, racial diversity, stereotypes, and the multi-layered challenges involved in coming out. It was very well done, and it also left you feeling touched. It was more complex than I expected, and it had a nice blend of humor and drama. It was a nice update to the story of teen love, and it tackled gay love in a manner that wasn't a cliche."
"479",5,"  Perfect jumble of emotional range! Great for anybody!"
"480",5,"  YALL THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD!!!! I laughed and cried which proves it's a great movie. Highly recommend"
"481",5,"  Great movie. It was actually very funny on top of sending a very positive message."
"482",4.5,"  This movie made me smile, laugh and cry!"
"483",4,"  Love, Simon was a funny and heartwarming romcom which definitely broke down a wall. After reading the book, I was somewhat nervous going into Love, Simon as movies based on books usually have major differences and that somewhat frustrates me, which is why I was presently surprised after the movie was over. Some scenes are almost exactly the same. Nick Robinson's performance as the title character was very emotional and entertaining and I really can't picture anyone else portraying Simon. Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. were also great. Although I wouldn't really call Love, Simon a full on comedy, some moments were absolutely hilarious and made the movie more entertaining. This movie also felt realistic, not some soapy romance movie that had to end in some tragic twist, it felt real. There were a few confusing moments and I felt like they could have shown more and talked about more of the messages that were sent between Simon and Blue, but it didn't drastically affect the film. With a great cast, positive messages about being who you are and not letting people drag you down, and hilarious moments, Love, Simon was a very enjoyable and heartfelt experience that I will gladly watch again. 85%"
"484",5,"  Of course it's never easy to come out, and it makes me so happy that the movie got every detail of the emotions right. It was so hard since I was 12 to live with that huge ass secret. If I were 16 in 2001, it would've been completely different. I always thought, nobody can know that I'm gay. I just can't believe that the world has changed so much over the years."
"485",5,"  It's been 25 years since Philadelphia. This should be the subtitled: ""A John Hugh's movie for the modern age"". The characters are quirky and likeable. There is that teen party without adult supervision. Love Simon has some whip funny lines. The performances are all strong. Nick Robinson as the titular character is particularly empathy-worthy. There have been a number of gay youth coming of age movies over the years, and my main worry half way through this one is that it would not have the wounded angst that makes a movie of this type hurt so good. Alas not to worry. The open heartache is slightly gut wrenching. And the movie nicely rounds out to salve it all over. I was expecting a Biloxi Blue's reveal but was pleasantly surprised once again. For tonality, I like that this one is slightly lighter than that genre cousin, ""Perk of Being a Wallflower"". I know it was a preview screening, but it was one of the first times I have had an audience applaud since the Hulk tossed Loki around in Avengers. Enough of referencing other movies. I will mention an old trope of mine. It's about movie rhythm; The beginning, middle, ending and pacing; The lack of meaningless car-chases which are pretty much not a part of anyone's real life. These are the things that help make a movie good, and this one great."
"486",4.5,"  I really loved the movie for its amazing humor and the emotion it showed. I could understand how the characters felt like i was one of them and that was nice. It also made me cry several times which not a lot and rarely ever happen when I watch movies. Overall it was amazeballs and I sure am glad I decided to go watch it."
"487",5,"  LOVE SIMON IS BEAUTIFUL AND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T GIVE IT 5 STARS CAN FIGHT ME"
"488",5,"  I SAW IT AND I LOVE MY GAY SONS SO MUCH I CRIED OH MY GOD FHAUSHFU AFDAWS"
"489",0.5,"  For anyone that is mildly interested in this movie as an adaptation from the book Simon Vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda, it fails miserably in most aspects. The only things that I feel this movie adapted correctly from the book are the character's physical appearances-- which are mediocre at best (they didn't even make Bieber a Golden Retriever). The rest of the movie, in my opinion, is so extremely subpar that I could barely follow the storyline and I've read the book multiple times. My roommate, who hasn't read the book, and I went to see it today and-- I kid you not-- they mention Bram's name, Nora's name, Garrett's name, and Nick's name a total of two times each at the maximum. The end of the movie rolled around and the big reveal for Blue (which failed miserably because everyone already knew who Blue was because the writers of the movie literally made Blue and Simon have a conversation about Halloween Oreos and then Bram turned around not even 3 minutes later and commented on Simon's Halloween Oreos at lunch) and my roommate literally turned to me and asked me who Blue was because Bram has so little screen time. The characters personalities also fall so incredibly flat that you find yourself liking Martin Addison only because he's the only character that develops any kind of personality. No, wait, I take that back. There's a character names Lyle (Yes, I know that name sounds incredibly unfamiliar to you. That would be because Lyle doesn't exist in the books.) that Simon believes is Blue for a short time-- which is utter bullshit because Simon knows that Blue goes to Creekwood and Lyle works at the Waffle House-- until they have a conversation and Lyle asks if Abby is single. I kid you not when I tell you that I think Bella from the Twilight movies had more character than Bram/Blue.Now, if you're thinking ""that's not too bad. I'm sure I'll understand the characters. I read the book and the movie probably stays true to the book"" no. You're wrong. I can count on one hand all the ways the movie stays true to the book: the characters names are all the same, Martin blackmails Simon (but he's much more aggressive and outright about it being a blackmail than he was in the book and doesn't try to deny it), Bram posts on the Tumblr page (but he does not write an ocean metaphor, instead he talks about a ferris wheel because the movie had to make a big deal out of a ferris wheel at the end when Bram and Simon ride together. Yeah, you read correctly, they ride a ferris wheel. Not a Tilt-A-Whirl.), Simon finds out that it's Bram when they meet at the carnival (but again, ferris wheel) and Simon and Bram have the same math class. That's it. That is all the accuracy you're going to get from the book.Now, let's talk inaccuracy. Not only does the movie make pointless changes like making Nora a baker (what?) and never holding the talent show, making Simon a senior in High school with a dream of college in LA (what?), and introducing a random Vice Principal that is unneeded and only there so everyone in the theater can laugh at how stupid he is. It also changes major plot elements. Leah, the anime loving, gay obsessed friend that is in love with Nick? Nah. She's in love with Simon and doesn't give two craps out anime or yaoi. In fact, she's not even emotionally repressed like in the book. Nah, she tries to tell Simon that she loves him. In fact, she gets mad at Simon (not for going to hang out with Abby and Nick without her because the whole gay bar scene/getting drunk and going back for the shirt scene/ getting grounded never happens) because Simon (who is incredibly off character for the Simon I loved in the books) gets her a date with Nick to try and keep Abby and Nick apart because HE IS ACTIVELY MESSING WITH HIS FRIENDS' LIVES IN THE MOVIE. Which is why Abby and Nick are mad at Simon in the movie-- because he was a major asshole and lied to his friends to keep them apart and help Martin. Speaking of Martin, he's the only character in the whole cast that I ended up liking, which is entirely wrong because he's a blackmailing asshole. They give him this big redemption scene with Abby and Simon at the Waffle House where he makes Abby believe that she deserves a ""superhero"" for a dad instead of who she got and then they make him a bullying victim because when he asks Abby to date him on the field at homecoming (You read that right, he steals the microphone from Taylor Metternich at homecoming during the National Anthem and asks Abby to date him with doves and everything) the entire school picks on him for failing. That's why he outs Simon in the movie-- because he got shot down and needed something to take the negative attention off of him. Now, you might be wondering how Simon and Blue stop talking if Simon never gets grounded for getting drunk (""But he gets drunk in the trailer?"" you say? Well, his parents apparently don't care because he didn't drive and is home before curfew.). Well, let me tell you, BLUE BLOCKS SIMON AFTER HE'S OUTED. You heard me. Gentle, kind, loving Blue blocks Simon's email because he's afraid of being out, but don't worry he's already told his family. So, I guess he just doesn't want the school to know until the very end when he rides the ferris wheel with Simon while the whole school watches because Simon posted an open announcement on the Tumblr page to get Blue there and apparently no one in the city had anything better to do than stand there for hours and watch Simon ride a ferris wheel while he waits for Blue. Okay..... sure. Now, let's talk Cal because surely they had to get one character right, right? Nah. Cal has like 5 speaking parts that amount to ""I'm going away for Christmas."" and ""No. I'm not Blue. Sorry, Simon"". The scene where they push each other on rolling chairs down halls? Never happens. The scene where Cal tells Simon he's Bi and asks him out? Never happens. Every scene with Cal ever? Never happens. Then how does Simon think Blue is Cal, you ask? Well, because he says he's going away to the middle of nowhere for Christmas and Blue also CONVENIENTLY is going away to a lake house with no wifi (which doesn't happen, but whatever.) It's fine though because he only thinks it's Cal for approximately five minutes before he's told otherwise. Whatever. The emails? They're about as long as texts and equally as irrelevant. Simon and Blue discuss little to nothing and, because of this, their entire relationship falls flat.Now, let's talk specific details they missed. Simon doesn't wear glasses. Bieber isn't a golden retriever. Nora isn't in a band. Alice doesn't exist. Blue doesn't ever mention his nauseation. There is no Tilt-A-Whirl. Garrett doesn't like Leah. There is no Mr. Wise and no english class. Ms. Albright is not redheaded, but African American. Nick doesn't play guitar. Abby doesn't take the bus to school (Simon picks her up because she lives in town). The cute shopping/eating Oreos scene never happens with Bram and Simon. There is no Orange Frost or alone time for them (in fact, their onscreen relationship time amounts to about 5 minutes). They do a production of Cabaret, not Oliver! Elliott Smith is never mentioned. Simon's email address is ""outmywindow1."" Nora doesn't ride to school with Simon. Simon's parents let him drive 4 other kids to school. Simon apparently has a Panic! At The Disco love. Leah has a dog. Abby doesn't dance and isn't a cheerleader. Leah doesn't draw. You never seen Bram play soccer or in a soccer uniform. Simon emails Blue onscreen, not before the movie starts like in the book, so I can only assume they've only talked for a few months by the end of the whole movie.Honestly, I'm sure there are more, the entire movie is a long, painfully horrible adaptation of a wonderful book. So, don't go see it if you want to actually watch Simon and Bram fall in love."
"490",5,"  Its a beatiful movie and it tell a thing not especifically and i love it"
"491",5,"  So sweet and full of heart.Very entertaining and a must see."
"492",5,"  This movie is everything I expected and more. It was so amazing and instantly became my favorite film. I am most definitely going to see it again!"
"493",5,"  A strong ensemble lead by Nick Robinson. The high schoolers acted and looked like they were actually in high school. The teachers seemed like real people, if tilted to the comedy side. A nice modern tone, light on drama, but emotionally effecting. I want to see it again."
"494",2,"  More like an After School Special.Initially I thought this is a very good movie but the more I thought about it, the lower my impression was. All the politically correct boxes where checked, white upper middle class, poor black girl from Baltimore, stereotypical over the top gay boy, obnoxious nerd, and the tri-factor of Black, Gay, and Jewish. Nick Robinson did not look 17, yet more like a college senior than high school senior. Jennifer Gardner as the mother/psychotherapist was not very in tune with her own child, and her acting was mediocre at best, and her later response to Simon's coming out was lackluster for a mental health professional, Josh Duhamel, Simon's father played a stereotypical one dimensional post college football jock. The Drama Coach was the funniest character and the Vice principal had 10 more minutes of screen time than necessary. I think my biggest problem was with the lack of response by parents of their sons force outing and more so the lack of repercussions faced by Nick's character. This is a great feel-good movie until you start think back on what you saw."
"495",5,"  Wonderful!! If you are young, or you care about teens, work with teens, are parents of teens, remember being a teen, enjoy good movies, see this movie!"
"496",5,"  This is by far the best movie i've seen in a really long time."
"497",5,"  If you see this movie and don't fall in love, I'll pay for your ticket. Love, Simon opens in theaters today.If you're someone who needs cheering up, needs to laugh, to feel loved, to feel accepted, to leave a movie theater with a huge smile on your face and, perhaps, some tears in your eyes, run to this movie. I saw it last weekend and cannot wait to get back to the theater to see it...again and again and again. I absolutely love Simon."
"498",3.5,"  Love, Simon appeals to an audience whose dying for a great romance film. Inspiring, motivating, and beautiful, Love, Simon will be the movie young audiences will be talking about for years."
"499",5,"  Tastefully done, well done for all ages in my opinion ..a must see"
"500",3,"  Love, Simon is an uplifting and irresistible new coming out story directed by Greg Berlanti. Simon (played by Nick Robinson) plays gay teenager Simon, who is struggling with his sexuality while trying to find out who the mutually gay and anonymous classmate is at his school whom he is chatting with online. Finally, Hollywood has produced a romantic comedy for young LGBT audiences that is refreshing and fun."
"501",0.5,"  Another waste of time movie to confuse young people."
"502",4,"  As with Wonder (2017), Love, Simon urges social acceptance within our community. While Wonder, which revolves around social fear and arrogance of those who look different than us, Love, Simon immerses moviegoers in a hotly contested topic that is usually met with an unparalleled amount of hate and cruelty. Yes, brutal honesty, but it's an unfortunate reality. Watching this film doesn't feel as if its pushing an agenda, but urges social acceptance in our schools, families and communities by showcasing the trials and tribulations of a teen trying to understand himself while longing for acceptance. It's worth a watch. After all, everyone deserves a great love story!"
"503",5,"  This is a movie that High school students and parents should watch. This movie is magical in a sense how much heart it carries. It relates to what is going on and can speak to many types of people. GO WATCH THIS!"
"504",5,"  Love, Simon is so refreshingly wholesome and mainstream for the gay community. I left the theatre, proud to be gay! A wonderful film about family, friends, and a first love. Go see this film!"
"505",4,"  It's a little shocking to think that it took until 2018 to finally have a teen movie whose lead character is gay. We have seen plenty of gay characters on television and in movies before, but they're usually the sassy sidekicks offering moral support to the female protagonist. Love, Simon finally breaks that convention in telling Simon's story. Nick Robinson (Jurassic World) plays the titular character who explains to the audience in his opening narration that he's just like any perfectly normal teenager. He comes from a loving and supportive home and has a close circle of friends. There's just one major secret that he's keeping from them. He knows at the age of seventeen that he's gay. He wouldn't be the first openly gay kid at school as Ethan (Moore) already lives his truth despite the constant mocking he gets from their classmates.The kids at school use a secret online forum to post their inner reflections and juicy hallway gossip. One day Simon reads a message from someone nicknamed ""Blue"" who opens up that he's gay. Simon is somewhat elated in knowing that there's someone else out there at school just like him. Simon creates a fake email and replies back to Blue as ""Jacques."" They begin an email correspondence opening up about their ""when did you know"" stories. It's a safe space for both of them to be who their true selves. Back at school, Simon and his friends go about their days getting ready for homecoming and rehearsing their fall production of Cabaret. Simon starts to look around trying to discover Blue's true identity as he starts to fall in love. Could it be Cabaret's pianist Cal (Heizer), his good friend Bram (Lonsdale), or is it Lyle (Pollari), the waiter at the local Waffle House? It's fun to see Simon's inner thoughts play out as he tries to connect the dots with each guy.Like any good teen flick, Simon's journey to acceptance is not an easy one. Teens can be cruel, and we see that played out here when the emails are found on an school computer. It becomes heartbreaking to watch someone start to come into their own only to witness the negative reaction that comes with it. That's just one of the reasons why Love, Simon works so well. It gets it right. It may be a Hollywood flick, but that doesn't make it out of touch with reality. As Simon and Blue's emails continue, their stories and natural fears ring true to what it's like to discover one's sexuality. I clearly remember that initial fear of how coming out could change everything when you just want your life and relationships to stay the same.In the '80s it was the John Hughes films, and in the '90s we had movies like American Pie, She's All That, or 10 Things I Hate About You. This generation of teens can look upon films like Love, Simon or The Perks of Being a Wallflower to represent their youth. Much like those films, Simon comes with a cast of characters each having their own individual style and personality. It's refreshing to not see a bunch of teen stereotypes. They're all going through something as we see with Simon's best friend Leah, played by Katherine Langford from 13 Reasons Why. They're always together, but Simon's deft ways doesn't allow him to notice that she has a deep crush on him. Nick Robinson is extremely charming as Simon. He's a flawed character, but someone worthy of love. Natasha Rothwell is a scene-stealer as the drama teacher. She has a fantastic scene where we see her put two bullies in their place. Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel also co-star as Simon's loving, and sometimes awkward, parents.Love, Simon has those quintessential grand gestures where some come with rejection while others will have you cheering and applauding loudly from your seat. It's all set against a stellar soundtrack curated by Jack Antonoff. It was refreshing to be in a theater with an audience that was rooting for Simon to fall in love. You could hear and feel the excitement in the air. It was a needed reminder that there is hope and love in this world when it seems like fear, anger, and bullying are ramping up again to dangerous highs. Love, Simon is that perfect movie to help teens, or anyone else, live their truth.Director Greg Berlanti, best known for his work on television with Dawson's' Creek, Brothers & Sisters, and the DC superhero universe on the CW, is an out gay man. I can only assume that his own history helped him navigate this story with just the right touch to keep it grounded. The film starts off fairly easy-going, but there's a turning point in the story that takes it to even greater depth. It's a heartfelt drama with consequences where no character or action felt inauthentic. Characters make stupid decisions and are held accountable. By the end you'll be laughing through the tears, which is how it should be.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Go fall in love with Simon and support these stories.RATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS"
"506",5,"  Superb, emotional, powerful, funny, heartwarming, and with fantastic writing and acting, to boot. This movie is so important, and it's a great thing that it's so, so good."
"507",5,"  This movie was amazing! I saw so much of myself in this story. It was up to date with out being an awful teen movie. It made me cry, it made me laugh, all around a must see movie."
"508",4.5,"  if you have not read the book you will love it so much! If you have read it, you will still love it! While the book is better (in most cases it always is). The movie captures the essence and overall heart of the book. This movie means so much to me as a gay person and it will always be one of my favorite films of all time. Great cast and great acting. Beautiful camera angles/shots. Magnificent story as whole. It's funny, cute, sad and relatable (especially if you're LGBT). It's the pure definition of entertainment! Everyone should go see this movie."
"509",0.5,"  Love, Simon is a subpar movie that tries to discuss the struggles of coming out. His love story with Blue is a bit far fetched because Simon would not have nervousness to the point he did. While the movie touched really well on how difficult it is to come out, it did a horrible job on the actual love story. If I were to recommend this movie to anyone, which I will not, I would recommend it to a middle school student or a freshman in high school. This movie had the potential to really go in depth about relationships in the LGBTQ community, but failed at doing so."
"510",5,"  It was heartfelt. It's a true love story for our time."
"511",5,"  such an incredible movie. so refreshing, current, and a great message for everyone."
"512",5,"  A journalist for Time Magazine wrote an article about this movie and stated that teens today don't need this movie; that in 2018 individuals like Simon have a good chance of fitting in, and it is unnecessary. Let me begin by saying he is wrong. This, first off, was a fantastic movie. It had a great mix of comedy, drama, and romance. That is something that is sorely lacking in LGBT film today. Many of them are far to serious and dramatic (""Call me by your name"", ""The Normal Heart"", Etc.) or are so flamboyant and ridiculous that no one can relate to it, but it is still a good movie (""Birdcage""). This is the only film that I have encountered that accurately portrays ones fears of coming out of the closet, and being in the closet trying to just survive high school. What this Time writer doesn't realize is that coming out is not just about ""fitting in"". In fact, many individuals coming out in high school worry because they are essentially painting a target on their back for bullying. It's terrifying because there are ultraconservative parents who kick their children out based on sexual orientation. Friends that get weird because they think ""What if this person thinks of me in that way?"". Coming out changes the dynamic between you and the people around you, and some people become hostile towards LGBT youth. Whenever I myself came out with my first boyfriend on Facebook someone from his friends list messaged me and told me ""What you are doing is wrong"". The fact that someone who is a complete stranger felt comfortable confronting me on my sexual orientation and thought it was their business to lecture me was just absurd. But anyway, as Simon said in the trailer for the movie, ""announcing who you are to the world can be pretty scary"", and I think really that is why this film is important. It reminds people that while coming out is terrifying, all that matters is that you are happy with who you are."
"513",4,"  This ""John Hughes"" 80's teen moivie is upsdated to now. This coming of age movie (clloseted gay teen) looking for love in a very upper middle class loving home and community. via social network. Charming from beginning to end. (The dircetor Greg Berlaniti directed one of my favorite short lived tv shows, Jack and Bobby which isn't on dvd.)"
"514",5,"  i cried about ten times, it was so relatable and i just wanna hug everyone who took part in making it"
"515",0.5,"  This was a horrible movie. Pushing a nerrative that is not the majority of teens."
"516",5,"  It's the teen classic of this decade, just like The Breakfast Club was for the 80s!!! The characters are as rich, the storylines are even more authentic! and most of all the actors do a wonderful job of bringing out what today's teenagers feel! I mean I was surprised by the amount of caliber they had for a teen movie but only the great movies do and Love, Simon easily sits on the SAME PEDESTAL as The Breakfast Club (1985)!"
"517",5,"  Incredible! Heart wrenching and warming at the same time - already booked tickets to see again"
"518",5,"  It's a must see. Reminds me of an 80's John Hughes movie. You aren't going to die with laughter but it's funny. You aren't going to exactly relate to one of the characters but you'll want to. And you'll leave thinking it was pretty good but it will continue to run through your brain as you think about what a big deal this movie is for the LGBT community and that some day, it won't be. The movie could also serve as a PSA for all parents."
"519",5,"  10/10, beautiful, original, just all around amazing"
"520",5,"  Absolutely loved it!"
"521",5,"  After watching this, I felt normal. I felt loved. I felt human.Everyone needs to see this movie."
"522",4.5,"  This was a beautiful story told in today's views. Unwarranted fears and love. I cried a lot go see this movie."
"523",5,"  It is such a good movie and honestly just such an amazing adaptation and I'm just so glad this movie exists!!!"
"524",5,"  Groundbreaking and amazing. This movie means so much to me and I hope people go out and see this movie."
"525",5,"  Best romantic comedy since ""Easy A""! The film had a perfect balance of humor, drama, and honesty. Great acting made the story believable. Go see it, you won't regret it!"
"526",5,"  I saw this movie tonight and it is sweet, romantic, funny and certainly a movie I wish was around when I was younger. Please see this movie!"
"527",5,"  Amazing and really important. This movie was just the best and I am so glad we are getting stories like this: stories that need to be told. I smiled, laughed, cried, it was literally everything I wanted."
"528",5,"  Really great, touching, funny, heartfelt, important movie. Does the storyline from the book justice, but does leave out some details. Overall though, it was very enjoyable, relateable and does a wonderful job of illustrating the struggles so many teens face today. Can't wait to see it again on release day!"
"529",4.5,"  In a world where coming of age movies are everywhere, ""Love, Simon"" somehow manages to stand out. This is a movie that has a heartwarming story with likable characters. Nick Robinson stands out in the lead role and portrays a genuinely likable character who is also shown as flawed at times. The supporting†cast is also good and compared to other movies, this one does a relatively good job of making everyone feel like actual high schoolers. While I thought all of the dramatic elements were handled very well, I also thought the movie had some very funny moments and the dialogue had good timing. The mystery element of the movie keeps your interest and has a good payoff by the end of it. My only complaint about the movie is that since it is targeted at a teenage audience, some moments are a bit cheesy and will make older people roll their eyes. Nonetheless, this is a positive movie about being proud of who you are that will leave you with a warm feeling in your heart. This movie is absolutely one of the first big surprises of 2018 and is worth checking out if you're looking for a creative spin on the coming of age genre.¬†"
"530",4,"  Ok well first of all, i am not a libtard, i ended up in a free screening of this movie and i will make it simple, this movie is really enjoyable, in a ''easy a'' kinda way. i would definitely recommend it to anyone."
"531",5,"  Wow! This is possibly one of my favorite movies ever. This movie took me up and down on an emotional rollercoaster, I cried, I laughed, I swooned. And it resonated with me on so many personal levels. The thing that hit me the hardest in this movie was the fact that I went through this exact same thing just a couple years ago, except for the blackmailing of course. I felt Simons highs and lows so deeply because they were and still are my highs and lows, his struggles are my struggles, his fears are my fears, because, yes, I'm gay. Never before have I felt like I could relate to a character as much as I do with Simon and that really made this move the experience of a lifetime for me. The fact that someone like me can be depicted in such a beautifully authentic, and painfully honest way in a blockbuster movie speaks volumes to how far we've come. Granted we still have lightyears to go. But, despite the fact that I am already out Simon's story inspired me so much that I want to do it again, I want to shout it from the rooftops, from the freaking mountaintops. I'M GAY! And I deserve a great love story just as much as Simon."
"532",5,"  This movie is everything I wanted as a teen struggling to accept my sexuality and I couldn't be happier that the LGBT teens of today are getting to see themselves portrayed in a way no other movie has done before. call it what you want, but in all my years of going to the movies I have never seen an audience reaction this strong. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. Love, Simon is an instant classic, one I can see myself watching again and again, and has a protagonist that you will, in fact, love."
"533",5,"  It's your typical coming of age film with the most delightful of twists. Get ready to have all the feels!!!"
"534",5,"  This's movie is a great! Captures the life of a kid trying to come out, even though he goes through downfalls, he comes back up."
"535",5,"  It was cute, it was romantic, it was heartwarming. The way the e-mails were integrated into the narrative was very creative, and I love that we follow the inside of Simon's mind as well as what is actually happening. It was hilarious, and a pleasure."
"536",3,"  It's good to see stories being made about the experiences of gay teens. But this one is typical Hollywood - superficial, clichÈd, stereotyped, and saccharine. The cast do a good job of acting their parts, but the script is predictable and superficial. It does make some good points about cyber-bullying. There's a warmth that is endearing but it's clearly made for an American teen demographic. Jon Frosch, of The Hollywood Reporter, describes it as '... an expertly carved chunk of cheese.' Pretty accurate."
"537",5,"  Very cute and made me laugh and cry and laugh while crying!"
"538",5,"  ""Love, Simon"" is truly an instant class, and beyond perfect. It has heart and everything I could have asked for."
"539",5,"  I ran the full spectrum of emotions with this movie. I walked in not expecting much more than a typical teen dramedy, and walked out loving it. I haven't watched a movie that made me feel this alive in awhile. Definitely recommend, especially if you are a teenager or have a teenager in your home."
"540",5,"  Dear 0 Star reviewer... please lead the way."
"541",4.5,"  I didn't think I would, but I loved it.The first twenty minutes or so, I cringed a few times, thinking it was going to be too clever, too cute, and too precious for its own good.But even my cynical, hard-hearted self soon melted with the realization that the intelligence, depth, and charm were all legitimate and sincere.I left the theater with a full heart and am confident ""Love, Simon"" will remain with me as one of my favorites of this new film year."
"542",5,"  Heartfelt, coming of age story."

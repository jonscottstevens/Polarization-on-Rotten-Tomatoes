"1",2,"  Very pretty, but without substance. I am confused why the pro critics thought this was interesting. Removing all the dialogue would have significantly improved the film, as the viewer could have made up an interesting explanation for the pretty pictures."
"2",3.5,"  A really good sci-fi flick, with a lot to think about. Lots of good visuals throughout and a solid performance from Natalie Portman"
"3",2,"  The premise had potential. But in the end it was disappointing."
"4",1,"  Falsely complex. As a biologist, I understand what inspired the movie. But the delivery is flat."
"5",5,"  Annihilation is an alien movie like no other. Sci-fi and horror all rolled in to one that leaves you asking many questions and pondering our existence on this earth. Are we truly alone ?"
"6",1.5,"  The movie was nothing new. The story was standard and predictable. The concept was alright. There was nothing challenging about this movie. I am seriously doubting Netflix as a producer of movies."
"7",4.5,"  Annihilation is ambitious even for a sci-fi movie, it really challenges our believes on what is possible. Some peoples imagination might not stretch far enough but for me it really played in my mind and gave me a memorable feeling like nothing else, a feeling of the universe and what is and is not possible, we just don't know. Annihilation does a beautiful job at representing us with what the writer or the director thought could be possible and what an alien life form could end up being - strange and unlike anything we could imagine."
"8",5,"  I do not care if I sound smart or not. I liked the fucked up idea behind it. I ADORED the all female swat team into the unknown. I loved the terrifyingly beautiful or the beautiful terrifying. Its great. Like, you'll enjoy it. Chill."
"9",5,"  Whilst the movie chooses to switch up the order of events, change nuiances in the characters (The biggest being the psychologist), and some other minor details, the film adaptation takes all that is good within the book and adds a unique cinematic experience to it. The movie explains things that are more open ended in the book, and the book explains things that are more open ended in the movie with some parts painted with the same ominous brushstrokes which give each of them their unique identity. In this sense, It is unfair to compare and contrast them in terms of which is better, but only in ways which make them both uniquely brilliant. I was forced to try ti understand the implications of the story purely visually and emotionally. I've never had even the most profound movies cause me to completely deviate from words spoken, but Annihilation does this perfectly by the repitition of ""I don't know"", and the best movies leave with audiences uttering the same thing."
"10",5,"  Pure sci - fi love it"
"11",3,"  Annihilation is the second Sci-Fi movie directed by Alex Garland after his great debut Ex-Machina. Unfortunately, this movie is not as good as Ex-Machina. It suffers from the lack of characters depth, terrible pacing, and a lot of things that left unexplained which I considered as plot holes. I struggled to care about everything that happen with the characters in this movie aside of the character portrayed by Natalie Portman. But, I really appreciate the fact that this movie is beautifully shot and the fact that this movie is trying to be different than your ordinary Sci-Fi movie. This is definitely one of those movies that you couldn't only watch once, but you only want to watch it once. It might be that this movie could be a cult movie in the future like the original Blade Runner did."
"12",2,"  It was actually quite boring. Beatiful and well-made, though. It had a lot of nice ideas which weren't presented in a decent way, and I hated all the flashbacks/flashforwards. I would say that 80% of the film was wasted.Also, it had the most stereotypical portrayal of a lesbian I have seen in recent years (and, SPOILER, she is the only character we see suffer a horrible death, reinforcing the Evil/Dead Lesbian Trope).Oh, and I liked the soundtrack. It was nice that you didn't have to reach for the volume control every two minutes."
"13",5,"  This is a beautiful yet macabre sci-fi that will leave you scratching your head. The cast did a great job, everyone seemed to suit their roles. After the credits I found myself wanting to know so much more about the world and the creatures in it. If you really hate gore you may not like it but there isn't that much of it. Undoubtedly worth the watch,"
"14",4,"  I am in a state of cognitive dissonance about this film. From one side, it abandons all logic when it comes to 1) the decision-making for the organization, the resources and the execution of the mission by the government and the main characters and 2) the multiplicity of perspectives among people with common tendencies. From the other side, I haven't been so gripped, so thoughtful and so utterly horrified after watching a thriller in a long while! The visuals are mesmerizing and, yes, this film definitely expresses interesting ideas! The problem is... nobody is 100% sure which are those ideas! Revisiting all the clues we were given, I am highly confident about where the writer wanted to arrive and... it seems to be exactly were I thought he arrived in the first place. Certainly, vagueness forces the viewers to contemplate more on what they just saw and people will have interesting conversations about this film. Nevertheless, I think if one or two things were stated more clearly, the wider audience would have walked out more satisfied with this film. Recently, many mediocre artsy movies with a lot of flare and nothing at the core have shamelessly overused the vagueness card. As an audience, I would find some philosophical unambiguity refreshing. Overall, this film is haunting and seems to express some considerations about alternative intelligent life forms and our interaction with them, but is held back by some glaring mistakes that, upon editing, might have been avoided."
"15",5,"  Annihilation (2018) is a very intense, off the wall sci-fi movie that is filled with death, love, stunning visuals, and a bit of horror. The best part about Annihilation is that there is an all-female lead cast which is really significant and sends a statement considering the circumstances in Hollywood pertaining to gender. Not only are they bad ass women but they are also smart women who are each a different type of scientist, and that isn't something we see too often in these types of movies or in movies at all. I give Annihilation 5 out of 5 stars for keeping me entertained throughout the entirety of it and for making me want to read the novel that it is based off of. Usually I read the book and then watch the movie but that wasn't the case for Annihilation. If the movie is this good then the book has the be mind-blowing.  I really enjoyed the way Director Alex Garland set up the story, he cuts between past and present scenes throughout the movie. He gives us the background of Lena, the main character of the movie, and the life she is living as a biologist professor at Johns Hopkins. She hasn't seen or heard from her husband in a year. He shows up and it's as if his memory has been completely wiped away. His health starts to deteriorate quickly and the government takes Kane and Lena to Area X and she learns of ""the shimmer"" This is where the movie starts to get mind-altering, almost hallucinatory.  The shimmer is a place that defies the laws of nature, is drenched in colors and is visually striking. Garland makes the shimmer seem like a place of fantasy and a place that you would want to spend time in until something very dark emerges. That dark is the unknown and a place that is changing at a fast rate. There are flowers that are all the same species but very different looking. The animals that were once normal are evolving into monsters that have never been seen. In the very first scary scene there is an alligator that looks like an alligator but isn't quite like the alligators we are used to seeing. Not only is everything around them changing but they are changing as well. The group of women have to deal with this prism that refracts everything, with their own minds and if they can trust each other or not which is pretty great to watch because I think most people would feel the same way. I believe a soundtrack can make or break a movie and Annihilation's soundtrack definitely made the movie. The darkest parts are accompanied by equally dark music. Not only are we seeing some pretty horrific scenes we are hearing music that helps those goosebumps run from head to toe. Music that makes you feel as if you are actually there experiencing every bit of the shimmer. The music was never over used but used at just the right times, filled with intensity and made you feel disoriented. The swimming pool scene is by far one of the creepiest and the music really contributes to that creepiness, like nails on a chalkboard. In this scene we see the body of a man, who was part of a previous group that entered the shimmer, stuck up on the wall of the deep end of a swimming pool. The music we hear in this scene is not really music at all but more like an alarm that gets louder and louder as we see this body that has mutated in to something very out of this world.There's nothing worse than watching a movie with terrible acting, especially when you pay to see it in a theater. The acting in Annihilation is good and Natalie Portman does an excellent job in my opinion. I have seen a few movies she has done in the past where I thought she didn't do too well (Where the Heart Is) but she blew me away in Annihilation, she makes you feel like you aren't watching a movie. One scene that I think she did incredibly well in is the scene when she gets to the lighthouse and the humanoid emerges from the hole in the wall. She is watching this humanoid mimic her but it's a CGI character. She moves beautifully and makes it seem like the humanoid isn't CGI at all but rather a real person.Gareth Edwards Monsters (2010) has a similar plot to Annihilation's but one is far better than the other. The quality of Annihilation out weights Monsters by far. I'm sure budget has something to do with this but I was quite bored while watching Monsters, and I was on the edge of my seat, beginning to end while watching Annihilation. Garland gives us just the right amount of background on the main characters and Edwards' entire movie is focused entirely on the background. If I am going to watch a sci-fi movie about aliens I want to see more of the aliens. There's nothing wrong with a little romance in a sci-fi movie but that's all I saw in Monsters.Garland is giving us more questions than answers in Annihilation and I like movies like this because they keep us talking after the movie has ended. I watched this movie with my significant other and we left the theater with a bizarre feeling that's almost impossible to put into words, like a disconnect between mind and body and not unlike the otherworldly sensation of tripping on mushrooms. We talked about the movie for the entirety of our thirty-minute drive home and I think that says a lot about how well this movie is made. If you are in to sci-fi movies that are filled with great acting, great music, great visuals, and a great story then you will most likely enjoy Annihilation."
"16",0.5,"  MOVIE WAS A BUNCH OF BORING TRASH."
"17",3.5,"  A Black Swan and a brown bearANNIHILATIONCerebral sci-fi is very hard to get. Yet, some of the fascination about it comes from its sparseness. Alex Garland's new film is engaging both from a production point of view (the decisions of its distributors to opt for Netflix instead of theatrical may be a sign of a what the future holds for many films) and as a base of discussion of its themes. It's a film with a tight screenplay that develops its characters well enough for us to care and hides us just enough to keeps us guessing. It's paired with non-linear editing which, although truly disorienting in some instances, is progressively building tension. Some great visual effects (I live for the mould!) are paired with amazingly accomplished sequences that we are sure to continue to talk about. Regardless of any inconsistencies and a lack of care in the direction of some parts where it becomes dull, the movie greatest strength is its faithfulness to theme and consistency with the ideas it sets out from the get go. That of course, may throw some people off but your disdain shouldn't come from a lack of a clear answer or the inexistence of someone who tells you what the movie is about, but from the execution. Yes, the ending is hard to understand but if you say that you dislike the film because you didn't grasp its latter part, then you're missing the point, you're stuck in the classic construction where an interpretation is given to you instead of you speculating it. It's openness is what makes the film debatable, rewatchable and perfectly independent as a modern work of art. SPOILERish zoneI believe the film's meaning and themes to be quite clear: it sets out the idea that the human being has a natural tendency for self-destructiveness, as is the case with cancer cells replicating and mutating to eventually kill the body they inhabit. As so, that idea is carried out through the woman's motives for being in The Shimmer (they feel a drive to head out to a dangerous unknown which will probably kill them) and the finale, in which The Shimmer allows its destruction. That is finished off by the ending when Lena, a physically unaltered person willingly hugs the copy (the mutant which comes from replication) knowing that she would become contaminated (she wants to self-destruct). The Shimmer itself serves as a metaphor for humanity at a greater level, as its mutations that end up creating a para-utopia are destroyed by themselves. So not only it can be read as a self-destruction of the individual but also the annihilation that humans are doomed to inflict on themselves if environmentally unfriendly habits and political stances are carried out. We, in many ways are the replicated being burning our own lighthouse, the place we inhabit and grow from. Also, Lena is beautifully constructed has she feels the need to repair what she has done to her husband who only sought annihilation by going in the Shimmer when he found out she was cheating. Also, the theme of replication is carried out through the concept of the Shimmer in which versions of real life are presented as a not so distant cousins. As the wonderful soul-eating bear is a refracted version of a real one, so is the replicated being who becomes Lena's mutation. Also, I love that the deconstruction of the narrative allows to drive this theme forward, as the metaphysical aspects of the film make it extremely unsettling. The monster is us, as many sci-fi movies have told but this film is a beast."
"18",4.5,"  A fascinating movie that captivates you and never lets go. It's wildly different from the original material, but it's a very good movie nevertheless. The actresses shine in a simple but effective movie."
"19",5,"  Eerily beautiful and original sci-fi drama"
"20",1,"  Really bad. Vague storyline and simplistic ""what is the nature of mankind"" themes. Great visuals though and some concepts that could have been much better explored. Also can we move beyond incompetent military teams making bad decisions, going off alone, inadequate precautions for obviously dangerous situations.Not worth the time investment."
"21",3,"  It's fine, I guess. It certainly gets better as it goes on.Let's look at the good:-Portman is good. She's easily the best part of the movie-The visuals are great-The concept is pretty good-The last 20 minutes are goodAnd the bad:-The first half is so mediocre. I'd even go as far as saying it's bad.-Everyone besides Portman is sort of meh. -The writing isn't great.-The execution is pretty bad. I don't understand, why they would send in a team of scientist after several teams of soldiers didn't return. Some of them don't even have combat training.It's worth a watch. Only one though."
"22",1,"  I got an overdose of estrogen trying to watch this lame attempt at entertainment."
"23",4,"  Fantastic fairytale like sci-fi story. How this went unnoticed is proof of the dumbing down of Amercia"
"24",0.5,"  What can I even say about this? The dialogue at times is almost unbearable. A prime example of this is towards the end of the movie, during a flashback scene where Issac and Portman's characters literally say ""hey"" to each other as if it's supposed convey some sort of missed love. Plain and simple, the movie is a train wreck."
"25",5,"  Weird but I like that"
"26",2,"  This is the type of movie no one wants to admit they hated..Sometimes being vague is a powerful film-making tool - other times it's just lazy."
"27",4,"  Intrigante e uma vis„o mais moderna de invas√£o e horror, mas n√£o chega a te envolver e assustar como The Thing."
"28",0.5,"  I actually created an account to sign in and warn people off this drivel. I can't believe how highly reviewed it is, I love all sci fi, even bad sci fi. But this is absolute muck, 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Booooorrrrrrringggggg!!"
"29",3,"  No real resolution to the movie"
"30",2.5,"  Pretty visuals, but also pretty dumb, or more accurately pseudo smart that fails for me. A disappointment after Garland's Ex Machina. The many ideas that have been peddled before (from at least a dozen films/TV shows), plus the numerous irritating technical anomalies both kept me from getting into it, How many times do soldiers in films walk into contaminated combat zones with no helmets or any kind of protective gear or breathing apparatus? how often do we have to see a guy staring down a microscope and see cells dividing in real time every few seconds? Plus the ""twist"" at the end is pretty much laid on a plate in the opening scenes. I want to go back and watch Netflix's other recent SF offering, Mute. That was pretty bonkers but at least it kept me guessing **1/2"
"31",3.5,"  Original approach to alien invasion, unusual character choices, cool gore, this is good scifi. Tessa Thompson seems under-utilized, and the whole thing could have used more action, and weapons hardware in Aliens (1986) fashion."
"32",5,"  Thought provoking, movie about what makes us human. Visually stunning and original, sometimes scary. The ending is unexpected. Worth re-watching.I really enjoyed it, highly recommended"
"33",2.5,"  You sent how many people in without hazmat suits?"
"34",5,"  I strongly recommend people go to the nearest theater and see ""Annihilation"".You could also use the proxmate chrome extension, select the UK as your region, and watch it on Netflix*.* Long story short, Netflix bought the rights to the film, but it was marketed for release in the US with underwhelming box office numbers. Ipso facto, you can watch it this way. It probably won't accept your password, so just change it for that visit.If you've seen the previews, you're probably thinking, why is he recommending an alien SciFi horror flick, will we make it in time, and why did I bring helium instead of air? Aside from the fact that Natalie Portman is my shalomie homie and can rap better than Post Malone, this movie is intense--visually, suspensefully, and emotionally**.** Full disclosure: I did watch this movie the first time on 1.0 metric spores of Boomers. 9/10 will do again with 1.0 more just for the visuals.*** Warning - Slight spoilers ahead, but mostly just framing how the movie should/might be interpreted ***Here's the thing--the movie is an allegory for depression. It's loosely based off the first book in the Southern Reach Trilogy. Some key parts are there, but it largely diverges from the series. The movie is written and directed by the same guy (Alex Garland) that gave us another brilliant piece of SciFi cinematic excellence, ""Ex Machina"".Annihilation is, as it's mentioned in the film--self destruction, juxtaposed against an alien/biological ""virus"". The Shimmer (Area X in the book) is depression. Some fight it, face it, let it consume them (Just when you thought DiCaprio had it bad going against a bear in ""The Revenant""), or just accept it as a part of them. The dialogue throughout the movie is very revealing, especially when you think about it abstractly as if you are viewing the depression/shimmer and every character in it from a first person point-of-view with a third person perspective.What?! Exactly.There will be a scene where Lena (Natalie Portman) and Sheppard (Tuva Novotny) are rowing on a boat through the swamp--at this point Sheppard provides all the baggage for every character (an alcoholic, someone suicidal/scarred, someone fighting cancer, someone that's lost someone else, and someone that's lost themself because of a loss). It's very poignant dialogue.Are there gruesome scenes that might make it difficult to watch? Yes. Of course. It's a SciFi horror flick, you dingus! But you know what? Depression is hard to face and look at, and sometimes you have to have a friend cut you open and show your insides moving around to know that things are changing.Ultimately, people go into it and never really come out. If they do--are they different, or just fooling themselves and everyone else into thinking they are?"
"35",3.5,"  Thought-provoking, visually compelling and led by fine performances from its female cast, Annihilation has some positive points, but ultimately it turns out to be confusing and pretensious."
"36",4,"  A great sci-fi film that kept me involved in the story until the 3rd act. I was a bit tired so it might have been that, but overall the ending was filled with strange twists and turns that I had a really hard time following. I think you really have to be involved in the film to understand what it is saying, and I realize it doesn't hurt to read some of the write-ups after the fact. I think it is a beautiful film that deals with a lot of complex issues, so I reccomend it, but don't watch this when you want a light story or are looking for fun, it is deep for sure."
"37",5,"  Incredible storytelling. Perfectly dark and compelling. Life where life should not be..."
"38",1.5,"  Just too weird. Plus shortening the books was always going to be difficult."
"39",4.5,"  Great, smart and creepy sci-fi. Highly recommended."
"40",4,"  Annihilation is very good film with one serious flaw.The film explores important questions of evolution and identity. Who are we and how do we change, both as individuals and as a species? How would life which evolved on two different worlds interact? I could even sense a faint resonance with Solaris by Tarkovsky (not the Hollywood mess). Strong performances, with Portman as lead, keep the viewer engaged.The flaw is a completely irrelevant subplot centered on the Gyasi character. This was clearly added in an effort to molify those with a race-centric political agenda.Despite this serious flaw, Annihilation is worth seeing."
"41",4.5,"  Unusual piece for Natalie Portman - but she works well in it. Not without flaws, especially in the ending, but I enjoyed it as much as any of the maze runner's and more than the Divergent series, which this feels rather like."
"42",1.5,"  Boooooring... I really don't understand the great ratings, is visually pleasing and well acted, but the pace is iceberg movement slow... i ended thinking that the movie was an hour too long."
"43",5,"  Quero uma continuaÁ√£o IMEDIATAMENTE"
"44",4,"  Absolutely incredible. The entire film itself was a reflection of the theme on mutation: it subtly mutated from drama to sci-fi to horror and back again, unnerving the viewer with each unexpected shift"
"45",5,"  gorgeous cinematography, fascinating story, superb acting, intelligent.....thought provoking even long after seeing the movie."
"46",3.5,"  WILD. Thought provoking. worth a watch at home"
"47",4,"  It's thrilling, suspenseful and jaw-dropping."
"48",2.5,"  Great concept poorly executed. Warning: Spoilers.Okay so the idea of an alien mutating and combining DNA is pretty cool. I wasn't a fan of the special effects (twist some plastic flowers around some treetrunks anyone?) but could have ignored that. However there were just too many plot holes that I couldn't ignore. I mean, just to list a couple off the top of my head:- Everything gets mutated. Sure, I get that. But then why did they lose track of time?- Why didn't the army hang-glide into the lighthouse? Or wingsuit? Or boat in? Or at least go in along the shoreline? Why send them in through the path of most resistance - i.e, the jungle?- Why didn't they firebomb the area once their teams stopped coming back, and they noticed the shimmer growing? - Why didn't the previous crew leave something *actually useful* on the video camera, instead of creepily cutting someone up. Like, a quick warning - ""hey guys, we're mutating, you probably are too, maybe you should get out and tell someone instead of going to the lighthouse. Also, be careful of the giant bear..."" would have been pretty damn useful.- basic army training: ""great work on finding a tower for us all to sleep in gals. Now, let's set up a watchperson on the ground where anyone can attack them, and have a massive lantern shining so we attract predators and ruin our night vision.""- why didn't the military units ever make it to the lighthouse? I mean, a team of scientists did. And it's not like their 'science powers' actually helped them. The thing that helped the most was guns. And you know who had guns and knows how to use them properly? All the previous military teams.I could go on, but I'll stop. this wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't great. I wouldn't watch it again."
"49",4.5,"  A brilliantly made, intelligent, and often horrifying hard sci-fi film that certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, and is a bit vague in terms of plot (instead prioritizing a more artistic, contemplative, thematic story); but is still nothing short of a masterpiece that you truly have to see to believe (or even understand)."
"50",0.5,"  Ignoring all the logical inconsistencies, the physical inaccuracies, and the psychological incompatibilities, this was a great movie! I read quite a few of the reviews, and many people make great points when it comes to the simplicity of the ending of the invasion. However, I didn't find any that delve into the absolute absurdity of the ending! That was, to me, the biggest ""heeell no"" of them all. 1. We find out that the ""thing"" that is invading, copies DNA, and uses it to make random new things from them.2. We are shown that the husband has been copied, befriended his copy, and told his copy to find his wife. (which seems to be really, really stupid to me.) 3. Why did the cancer-ridden Doctor not also get copied? What was the point of the whole light show we got? 4. Once she knew that the husband was an alien copy. what was the point of the hug? Was she just happy that she got SOME version of her husband back?5. During the hug, why do her eyes change color? What was that supposed to tell us?Honestly, after overlooking most of the bull that was served in this film, I find myself begging for an ending that was, if not creative, then cliche; anything would have been better than what we got!I cannot recommend more that all humans that require some intellectual stimulation to enjoy a movie, avoid the crap out of this one. I want my time back. I am closer to my death now and wish I had wasted this time more wisely!"
"51",4,"  Annihilation is a tense, uneasy, mystery that unnerves the audience and gives them a story to ponder. The plot centers around Natalie Portman's character who goes into the Shimmer to find out what happened to her husband. She's joined by several other women as they face the horror and mystery inside. The plot is solid but takes awhile to get going. The Flashbacks are unnecessary and slow the story down. But once it picks up, it turns gruesome and begins to be terrifying, creating a sense of dread that sticks with you even after it's over. Visually, this movie is stunning, from the mutated creatures to the environment surrounding the characters. The score is also a stand out and is very haunting. Acting wise, most of them do solid jobs with Portman giving a great performance. And as the story comes to a close, it is mostly satisfying and validated what came before it. Overall, Annihilation is a well directed sci-fi film with some genuinely scary moments and stunning visuals though it runs a little too long and slow at times."
"52",2,"  Natalie Portman is gorgeous in this, acting superb. Some interesting visual effects (I didn't really enjoy them). Writers built on some decent themes, played with the audience's mind and expectations a bit. Well done.Couldn't stand the movie once we got to the cave. That was the climax of the story I suppose, but the images and sounds left me feeling physically ill. Like nails scraping against a chalk board. Ugh.This movie gets a low rating because the images and sounds left me nauseous and irritated. Not worth watching if you are susceptible to such things.You'll also be frustrated if you don't like ambiguous/challenging endings."
"53",3.5,"  Not flawless but a really solid sci-fi movie. Recommended!"
"54",2.5,"  liked the feel hoped for a repeat of arrival as in surprised and entertained but that was not the case here no explanation a tacked on unfinished ending and wasted potential the positives the visuals were beautiful and something unique"
"55",0.5,"  I don't get how people are ok with it being called sci-if, it doesn't make sense even within the rules n boundaries it sets itself. The connections between things I see, but I don't see them as deep or smart, just lazy n weak"
"56",2.5,"  Interesting premise although the script was a bit naff. Could have been shorter or had a more in that time. A lot of stuff just comes from nowhere!"
"57",4.5,"  Cracking film. Stunning to look at, great ideas and well played. Best sci-fi 'ideas' film I've seen in a long time."
"58",5,"  It feels unique and original. It's also horrific and beautiful at the same time. Already my favourite movie of 2018."
"59",5,"  Absolutely amazing I loved it my mind is blown away. This director needs to make more movies."
"60",3.5,"  Again, a movie adaptation of a good book. Was somewhat disappointed by the adaptation and the change in the story line but Natalie Portman gave a good performance."
"61",2,"  To start, that bear scene was pretty damn horrifying. As for the rest of the movie, horribly predictable and cliche, actors were (apart from Portman) just utter garbage, the twist was glaringly obvious, Jennifer Jason Leighs George Clooney impersonation was laughable and the list goes on."
"62",4.5,"  Creepy, engaging, at times horrifying, deeply fascinating. The plot will only make sense if you understand that every time they talk about 'prisms/refraction' they are referring to the physics of crystallography and diffraction."
"63",0.5,"  What the hell was that even"
"64",0.5,"  Total rubbish, looks like somebody got a special effects machine for Christmas and they thought it made them a blockbuster producer, AVOID !"
"65",3.5,"  Good Writing: 1.5 StarsThis was the weakest aspect of the movie. The potential was there but it fell short with not properly thought out motives for its characters. The majority of the plot revolves around the stars trekking through a swamp by foot to reach a light house on the coastline. Why they couldn't use a vehicle or even take the coast line to get to the lighthouse to begin with was not mentioned. Beyond the supernatural aspect of this movie, normal human behavior to circumstance was ignored. And when a character is sharing their recollection of past events, you cant have flashbacks during their recollection.Great Production: 2 starsThis is where the movie shined. Sound, music, set design and special affects were all super intense and vivid! Gotta love bears!"
"66",2.5,"  Well produced but absurd and a terrible ending."
"67",4.5,"  In stepping back from the tradition sci-fi tropes of an alien invasion, Annihilation offers a thought-provoking and original storyline to the credit of the source material. Those aware of the Southern Reach trilogy might appreciate the vagueness of the characters and the lack of traditional protagonist/antagonist storyline. Intentionally underdeveloped, the characters are by no means compelling, but certainly well-acted and purposeful. The soundtrack is superb and the blend of themes transition effortlessly in this intelligently-written story. There are moments that could have used further explanation and the ambiguous ending may frustrate some, but in Annihilation Alex Garland has succeeded in creating an original, tense and enjoyable sci-fi thriller, that will leave watchers thinking even after repeat viewing."
"68",1.5,"  Wow, what a steaming pile of magical shiny poop! Bear with me.I really, really wanted to like this movie. I'm a sucker for brilliant and intriguing ideas. Plus, with such an amazing cast it would be hard to go wrong, right? Well.Let's start with the good stuff:+ the acting was as good as it's gonna get when you force great actors to be constantly stunned and whisper-mumble in proper indie-movie fashion+some of it is really prettyNow the bad, and it's a lot:- Characters: We don't know anything about them except their professions. Their motivations are either not there or questionable. Like our main character Lena, whose husband is the lone survivor returning from the mysterious shimmer and suddenly and unreasonably starts spitting blood. Now here's what I don't understand - if someone comes back from Hiroshima with cancer or from Malaysia with Malaria nobody would actually suggest going there to find a cure. No, you'd look at the patient's body and look for a cause. Instead of some lame scene of our main characters being all Instagram-perfect in their sun-flooded bedroom, we could have really needed a scene explaining character motivation. How am I going to root for a character if I'm not invested in their cause?- Randomness to simulate meaning:A popular indie-film trick is to show us a lot of random awkward scenes to poke at our raw human-ness, which is great if there actually is a deeper meaning behind it. But this movie tries really hard to be about human identity, which has little to do with the plot and also we never quite get there. Instead, we see scenes of our main character cheating, which contributes nothing to the story and doesn't get resolved, either. And then there's that scene where they lose their memory, for no reason except it lets the producer of the hook because they don't have to shoot how they got there. - No one was employed to research the actual science:My biggest pet hate is when I'm taken for stupid. Okay, so (SPOILER) summary, within the shimmer, DNA gets scattered like ""light on a prism"". Amazingly interesting concept. Unfortunately, rock doesn't have DNA, so there's nothing to scatter for it to turn to dirt. Come on, now. Every sci-fi movie gets away with a little science mumbo-jumbo but that's just downright embarrassing.- Modern danceThe end made no sense, not scientifically, not logically. (SPOILER) I mean come on you're telling me in three years no one has tried to set fire to the thing? Plus, if it was that sensitive it would have burned up when entering the atmosphere. Seriously?There is one thing that the movie does really well, though - it shows how open the audience is to trickery. The movie is set up to look deep and meaningful and gloomy and looking at the ratings it has worked. A lot of mumbling, weirdness, randomness and a Stranger Things type soundtrack emulate real depth, sense and make try to brush over the fact that this movie has no coherent plot whatsoever."
"69",3.5,"  other then needing a few tweaks this was a enjoyable movie to watch. i wish they would have delve deeper into the mutation aspect rather than the mental aspect. i could see this as a 5 star sci-fi horror if they did."
"70",4,"  The second directorial offering from Alex Garland, who previously brought us the excellent Ex Machina, Annihilation doesn't match the quality or intrigue of what came before, but most of it is still a solid and very well put together movie. It's not as thought-provoking as it wants to be, and the climax is pure ridiculous Sci-fi, a classic example of a film nearly squandering a great build with a silly ending that feels entirely out of place and random. But the build is more than worth the watch. The steady camera movements and the stunning cinematography create an atmosphere of wonder and foreboding, and the CGI doesn't ever distract from the storyline. I love Natalie Portman as an actress, and while this might not be her best work, she still gives it her all and I was completely invested in her character. The rest of the cast are great too, at least for the limited time they're onscreen. It's framing device of a post-incident interview is completely unnecessary and only serves to spoil what's going to happen. Not to mention none of the dialogue in these scenes explains anything we couldn't have worked out for ourselves, or haven't already seen take place. But a few missteps aside, Annihilation is further evidence of a great talent that should kept an eye on in the years to come, and is a fun experience while it lasts."
"71",4,"  Good film that stayed relatively true to the source material despite a different ending."
"72",3,"  Was ok. NP was really good, supporting cast awful."
"73",4,"  An original movie, with a good idea ! And a good story to let her live and flower in a new second movie !!"
"74",5,"  Not what I was expecting at all, this movie is like something straight out of my childhood nightmare. Please watch it sober so you don?t have panic attacks."
"75",4,"  Very Atmospheric scfi-fi horror with some memorable moments. Nicely done."
"76",5,"  A masterful film that plays off of VandeerMeer's original masterpiece. Annihilation will leave your mind swimming within the Shimmer and this film will haunt your mind for days, weeks, and months on end. It's one of those films that is the same caliber as the Matrix or Minority Report. It leaves so much to the imagination. As a viewer you ultimately decide what the fate of the protagonist and humanity is as the Shimmer continues to expand and mutate the globe."
"77",4,"  Nice to see sci fi done in an original way, with soft folk songs providing an interesting backdrop to an intriguing, well written story that builds tension all the way to the (slightly confusing?) ending."
"78",1.5,"  Weird for the sake of being weird with no real explanation. Could have been so much better if the movie had any point to it.The resolution for the whole ""invasion"" was quite frankly ridiculous and inconsistent with the previous rules set within the movie."
"79",3.5,"  Writing 1.5 stars. This was the weakest aspect of the movie. The potential was there but it fell short with not properly thought out motives for its characters. The majority of the plot revolves around the stars trekking through a swamp by foot to reach a light house on the coastline. Why they couldn't use a vehicle or even take the coast line to get to the lighthouse to begin with was not mentioned. Beyond the supernatural aspect of this movie, normal human behavior to circumstance was ignored. And when a character is sharing their recollection of past events, you cant have flashbacks during their recollection.Production 2.0 stars. This is where the movie shined. Sound, music, set design and special affects were all super intense and vivid! Gotta love bears!"
"80",3,"  The only thing I liked about this movie was the ambiguous, non-cliche version of an alien. An alien that doesn't want anything, and isn't really anything until the end. The rest of the movie sucked. A teleporting invisible bear? A chick that goes crazy to add drama to the plot? A crocodile that sucks at killing? 3/5 Stars"
"81",5,"  Sometimes you are just looking at the screen like: ''Wow.. what the heck is happening?'' I freaking loved it. Last 30 mins are f*king crazy."
"82",4,"  Interessante, um tanto inc√¥modo, por√©m o ato final n√£o me capturou como o restante do filme."
"83",3,"  seperti kebanyakan film sci fi, fantasy, alien ujung-ujungnya udah ketebak sih. lumayan lah buat saya"
"84",3,"  An interesting, if a bit confusing at times, movie. It is visually stunning and very well put together. A mostly female cast does a very good job. Basically this is a SciFi movie based on Jeff Vandermee's award winning SciFi novel. The story is not told in chronological order, but I figured it out soon. Natalie Portman is the focus and she does a good job. It must of held my attention because we talked about it all through lunch. Recommended, but don't expect too much."
"85",1,"  This film is pretty consistently really nice to look at, I'll certainly admit that. However,, the utterly nonsensical plot eclipses this small positive. The film is difficult to watch without laughing. The characters make decisions and act in ways that are simply laughable, and are totally unrelatable. Those who rate it highly are incapable of logical thought or independent thinking. The critics are horribly wrong.1 star."
"86",4.5,"  After 'Ex Machina' which was a fantastic mix of science fiction and thriller, visionary director Alex Garland delivers again with Annihilation - a sci-fi horror hybrid which is influenced particularly by 'Alien' in the horror department and the works of Tarkovsky in its psychology/SF department but ends up being a unique mix of ideas regardless. His direction is brilliant and he is quickly becoming one of the best directors working today, Natalie Portman's lead performance is reliably terrific and the film is very clever and artistic thanks to the arresting visuals of The Shimmer, creepy, strange and fittingly otherworldly score and many fascinating metaphors and conversations. The highlights include the creature attack scene which is impressively unnerving and the ending which is of course admirably ambiguous and open for many different interpretations."
"87",3.5,"  This film adaptation of the first book in Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach Trilogy was quite different than the book in certain respects (i.e., there was no tower in the movie, it wasn't as rich as the book in general, and the ending was totally different), but worth the watch."
"88",1,"  So so so awful. instead of doing something in the vain of Resident Evil, they tried to do something similar in tone to Arrival, but with horrible art direction, flat performances, no chemistry with the lead actors, and a complete lack of engaging sound design or music, unless you count the last 10 minutes which was too little too late. I would say that the director, who's other work I really like, was completely up his own ass during this production, but he was definitely blowing himself during the entire production. So he couldn't have been entirely up his own ass."
"89",3,"  It's a metaphor, just not a very good one."
"90",5,"  Writer and director Alex Garland slowly turns an intriguing premise into an intense and destabilizing science fiction experience that you won't soon forget."
"91",0.5,"  The acting is terrible, The visual effects are cool, if you can ignore the hokey story"
"92",3,"  I recently finished reading the novel Annihilation which I enjoyed to an extent but a lot of it was lost on me and I found I couldn't really connect with any of the characters who all felt very anonymous. In Alex Garland's film the characters are a little more fleshed out, given names and back stories which I felt helps the viewer to connect. The storyline stays pretty close to the novel in that a team of specialists are sent into a site of an environmental disaster known as Area X. Previous teams sent in have all suffered various grim fates and the area seems to be evolving it's own species of plants and animals. As the team heads towards the epicentre which is a lighthouse they become suspicious of the reasons each of them is there and are slowly being stalked by something sinister.I thought the film was ok, it was a lot easier to get to grips with than the novel. The highlight was near the end and the discovery of what was in the lighthouse which visually was mind blowing and it was also a bit of a head-spinner story wise (especially compared with the revelations regarding the lighthouse in the book which are somewhat different). It was just a shame that the journey to the impressive ending was a bit of a slog. One other thing I very much enjoyed was the creature who emits the noise of the last person or thing they killed made, that was very creepy!Despite not enjoying this as much as his first feature, Ex Machina, it is still obvious that Alex Garland is a visionary director and if rumours are correct , I'm very curious as to what he will bring to a Swamp Thing movie!"
"93",3.5,"  Not the best scifi movie I've ever seen. Almost hits the fantasy territory - not a bad thing. Graphics and ambience 5/5. Takes your breath till the end. Let's hope the sequel gets some more explanations"
"94",4.5,"  a GOOD KIND OF CREEPY. fEMALE CAST WAS GREAT."
"95",3.5,"  Ending let it down, (cliched twinkle in the eye)... cool ideas and imagery. Very trippy. Worth a second watch. Pretty easy to predict whats coming."
"96",2,"  Annihilation is good only at the start and at the end, what's left in between is kind of a mumbo jumbo mess."
"97",3,"  Pure science fiction. Not a bad movie but the ending sucked to an extent."
"98",4.5,"  I bet Natalie thought she was taking s great part but boy did she get suckered. This movie is a ripe turd. A complete waste of 2 hours."
"99",1.5,"  was bit of a let down a lot a hip, all in all this was a really crappy movie"
"100",5,"  havent read the book so difficult to get all the philosophy behind this film but its a high concept sci fi thriller which has many complex social allegory. A great cinematic experience ."
"101",2.5,"  Slow movie. Nice build up but the ending was messy."
"102",3,"  More cerebral than emotional, a fascinating but not engrossing story. That ending, though. A visual feast that approaches transcendence. Approaches tedium."
"103",1.5,"  Expected Ex machina level stuff and instead I'm realising Gsrland fluked it. Dissapointment isn't the half of it."
"104",1.5,"  Such an incredibly stupid movie. There's 2 hours I will never get back. Horrible."
"105",4,"  Visually interesting and always intriguing this movie differs a lot from the book but never loses its focus. It?s terrifying in parts and beautiful to watch."
"106",2,"  i don't usually find myself in disagreement with rottentomatoes but this movie is really not that good. may be it's just me. the science sucks, the psycho mambo-jambo is not that impressive. if the director is suppose to be some kind of genius, i must have missed something. the only plus point for the movie is the cast, but in my opinion, that didn't save the movie."
"107",3.5,"  3/25/2018Natalie Portman's character Lena leading an all female team into the ""Shimmer"". This comes after several attempts failed in uncovering the mystery behind the extra-terrestrial activity within it's growing radius and after she suspects that a member of a previous expedition who returned was not her husband. The movie also features one of the most horrific natural aberrations you'll ever see."
"108",5,"  Cerebral, original and unsettling. Sci fi at its best thought provoking best."
"109",5,"  It was a little forced at the start... But evolved into something quite spectacular and mysterious. The movie can really make you ponder one's own biological existence and what makes us individuals, yet collectives."
"110",0.5,"  It's a friut cake movie. The worse movie this year. Hollywood is the worse by making movies Once you see it? You have just wasted your brain cells on a stupid movie. ."
"111",5,"  UN TRATADO FILOSOFICO SOBRE LA HUMANIDAD"
"112",5,"  Definitely in my top 3 sci-fi movies I've ever seen. Felt like a shot in the arm to a stagnent genre."
"113",1,"  I am a HUGE fan of ex machina and this film is UNWATCHABLE."
"114",3,"  Between 2.5 and 3. Although it maintains a good atmosphere most of the time, the lack of scientific credibility and the twisted end (more obssesed with high quality visual show than for a solid story) make some puzzlement at the end."
"115",1.5,"  A movie that seems to believe that making something purposefully confusing doesn't make it good. This movie is plain and 'tries to hard'. The plot twist can be seen from a mile away and leaves to many questions and loose ends to the story. Would not watch again."
"116",2.5,"  There were some pretty scenes with the weird plants and animals but that was about it for me. There probably were so many symbols that I didn't get but overall I found it superficial. I even don't like Natalie Portman in this movie."
"117",2.5,"  There are some interesting parts here, but the movie feels a bit flat. It could have benefited from either picking one genre or the other (scifi or horror) or not pussyfooting around both and just going straight in. I can't help but think this is one of those movies where they (at best) adapt half of a book into a movie, but leave out more than enough to not make it a good watch."
"118",2,"  You can't go wrong with Natalie Portman and she was the main reason why i chose to watch this movie.Unfortunately i thought this movie was lackluster, The soundtrack and editing was the worst part, The first 30 minutes of the movie are promising but then it goes from strange to stranger with no real explaining on what happens in the end."
"119",3.5,"  3.5 Not sure if brilliant or just strange. I shall call it brilange."
"120",2,"  The storyline was cliche and not terribly imaginative. The visuals were impressive but inconsistent. The we're just too many holes in the story to make it really entertaining. The plants mutated into human form, but not into any other animal form. The trees mutated into massive crystalline structures, however, not the grass surrounding them. This looks like a really good attempt at making something really unique, but it fell short on delivering and look more like something that belong on the Syfy channel"
"121",5,"  Enthralling mesmerising and visually beautiful. I have no idea why this brilliant film did not get released in cinemas. As each of the female protagonists takes their own journey into the mysterious shimmer, they encounter beauty and savagery like nature itself. This is the sort of movie that will haunt you for days and leave you wondering. For me the only weak point was the end that gives answers that feel quite banal after the elusive mysterious of the preceding scenes. Highly recommended."
"122",2.5,"  Thirty-nine years after Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpiece, director Alex Garland, who debuted with ""Ex Machina"" in 2014, released last month his version of ""Stalker"" called ""Annihilation,"" a fitting title as it ""refracts"" the original beauty of ""Stalker"" into something unrecognizable.The film's main premise rests predominantly on the Shimmer, a soap bubble-like field that slowly growing, mutating and ""refracting"" the DNA of all that it touches. In the film, Lena (Natalie Portman) is grieving the loss of her husband. When she musters up enough courage to paint their bedroom, her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) appears. Not long after, Kane starts coughing up blood, and eventually they all get taken to Area X, a super top secret military base. This parallels the story of ""Stalker,"" where the mysterious Stalker acts as guide for three unnamed men and take them deep into the Zone, all in hopes of finding the Room, which can grant them any wish. Like ""Annihilation"", ""Stalker"" also doesn't pick up until 40 minutes in, wherein they finally step into the Zone.All this exposition, though uncomfortable for any other movie, works well here. It establishes the characters, and had the movie any depth, it would allow us to care about and understand them. ""Annihilation's"" first pitfall is that none of the characters are particularly likable and are more akin to walking stereotypes. The movie refuses to believe in the audience's abilities, repeatedly using flashback sequences to reiterate a point, patronizing the audience.One of the reasons why ""Stalker"" is hailed as a masterpiece is due to its method of storytelling. Unlike later directors such as Wong Kar-Wai, the formula for a character study had not yet been laid. The idea of a story without a plot was still new. But ""Stalker""at its very core was a character study on not only the three unnamed men, but also a metaphor for life.At the core of ""Annihilation"" is a ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" - a movie that leaves the audience wondering what in the world is going on, and whether they've had a ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"" or the turd kind. ""Annihilation"" also suffers from ""Interstellar"" syndrome - the need to explain everything in a scientific way, but then suddenly turning a blind eye to science by asserting that somehow love transcends space and time. In this case, the Shimmer can simply do what it likes with complete disregard to everything that happened earlier. As Dr. Lena put it, ""That's literally not possible.""""Annihilation"" takes but does not give. It steals from countless classics with its cinematography, set design and plot. Even the dilapidated wooden shack that Tarkovsky loves so much is in the movie, as well as the stargate sequence from the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""But ""Annihilation"" does not even attempt to build upon its predecessors. Annihilation"" would be seen as an inaccessible movie that tries to be a bit everything while succeeding at none."
"123",2,"  Bem fraco, diz ser ficÁ√£o cient√≠fica mas est√° mais pra fantasia, roteiro confuso e pouca criatividade."
"124",4,"  Interesting enough, given the talented cast on offer. But it's a slow burner. Stick with until the end, when it truly reveals itself, and then puzzle over the clever ending."
"125",0.5,"  Movie was boring the previews gave away all the good parts in the movie..not worth seeing"
"126",1,"  Una mamada de proporciones epicas... comienza como una pelicula en la que se encuentran rambo y los cazafantasmas... el sue√±o humedo, la chaqueta mental de una feminazi. des√∫es de la primera media hora, solo me hacia una pregunta: ¬øA que hora se acaba?"
"127",4,"  The art direction during the climax scene was questionable. That tunnel looked really cheap & that ""thing"" also felt like an unfinished product. Otherwise, really enjoyed the movie overall."
"128",3.5,"  It's a smart film that sadly doesn't expect the same from the audience. There's a lot of greatness here that could be found after some editing. Certainly worth a view, but you'll be left with a fair bit of disappointment.Annihilation's strength is in its sense of wonder. It introduces intriguing ideas, but seems to be terrified of alienating its viewers - something entirely at odds with its premise. The biggest offender occurs not long after they enter The Shimmer. In a scene that seems much more at home in a Predator-esque popcorn film, a character explains how each member of their group is, as she puts it, ""damaged goods."" We need none of this information. The only person's story that comes into play (even thematically) is a woman whose long sleeves, we're told, are hiding the evidence of self-harm. Do we see her arms? Of course we do. So why, exactly, did we need to be told? Surely the filmmakers expected us to be able to piece it together.It's the quiet, unexplained moments that truly shine. However, it's understandable that other reviewers have the exact opposite reaction as I do, because of the inconsistent flip-flopping between ""popcorn thriller"" and ""quiet existential horror."" The latter is done wonderfully, but after trying so hard to keep you in the know, it's a bit jarring to be left uncertain. Kinda like Cloverfield. It was intriguing when you had the barest hint of what was happening, but the film wouldn't leave it be. Frankly, you can skip the entire first act of Annihilation - I imagine you'd have a much better time. Has the main character woken up in her tent yet? If not, fast-forward. As it is now, it disappointingly settles for ""good"" when you know it could be so much more."
"129",3,"  A decent sci-fi movie with a strong woman cast"
"130",1,"  No narrative, surreal nonsense. How much acid was the director on when he wrote and made this? Terrible and unentertaining."
"131",2,"  If you have two hours and to kill and $10 to waste, then go ahead and see this movie. The only thing that was consistent about this movie was nothing. There was nothing to grab a hold of. It was all over the place. Not really thought provoking either."
"132",4,"  Pay attention as it makes you think."
"133",5,"  An amazing film that has profound depth. It stirred my thoughts well after the movie was over. Once I thiought of the film as a metaphor it became truly great."
"134",1,"  Can't believe all the great stuff in the books that they ignored. The film feels like it was done by someone who only read the back cover of the book."
"135",3,"  The aliens have invaded, only in this take they've only grabbed one small portion of land. The authorities send in small teams to investigate (""why not a larger force,"" I asked, to no response), only none return. We follow the latest team's trip inside enemy held land. I was hooked with the premise, curious why a team would be sent that was all female - there's a point, right? (answer: there's no point). What emerges from the dark of the dense foliage can be seen as alien-sided rationalization for the classic ""invasion of the body snatchers' that's interesting, but unfortunately doesn't engage."
"136",1,"  i was expecting a fun movie , turned out to be a boring drawn out, weird movie about cell duplication , complete dog shit , do not waste your time!!! the trailer is better than the actual film."
"137",1,"  What a boring movie fell asleep 3 times watching this crap"
"138",3.5,"  kinda had no idea what was going on the whole time..."
"139",3,"  Otra de esas pelÌculas que quiere jugar con capa de ser ""Simb√≥lica"" e ""Intelectualmente compleja""; Su director saco aqu√≠ toda la mariguanez que no pudo en ""Ex Machina"". Le pel√≠cula es muuuuuy lenta, tediosa y francamente aburrida. Ni por un segundo le cre√≠ a Natalie Portman su papel de bi√≥loga molecular super avanzada. La realidad es esta; Pueden jugarle a que todo es metaf√≥rico y que habla de la complejidad de la interconexion y modificaci√≥n de la naturaleza y la introspecci√≥n filos√≥fica del devenir del ser y el por que estamos aqu√≠ blah blah... cosa que la pel√≠cula en ning√∫n momento se toma la molestia de explicar. Entiendan no hace falta leer tanto entre lineas, algo esta o no esta, se dice o no se dice. Mas en una pel√≠cula!, dejen de darle tanto cr√©dito a algo que claramente es pereza del director!. Si yo hago el primer plano de un aguacate que acabo de cortar y lo grabo durante dos horas, ¬øopinar√≠an que estoy tratando de reflejar la decadencia y ef√≠mera realidad de nuestra vida y el envejecimiento de nuestra alma que se oscurece inexorablemente?. he he he?. Cosas buenas que rescatar, tiene un par de secuencias medio gore que estan chidas, la direcci√≥n de arte y los efectos son excelentes, aun con esto no rescata para mi la pel√≠cula. Si quiere ver algo para hacer como que usted es intelectual y debatir con sus otros amigos que hacen como que son lo mismo, denle."
"140",2.5,"  Do not expect it to follow or achieve Vandemeer's novel's strength as a movie. in fact, you should expect a lot less. A great book in the hands of an excellent director gone entirely wrong."
"141",4,"  This is the most hardcore biology sci-fi seen in ages. Never look gastrulation in the hole lest you realise all life is full of shit."
"142",3,"  At times the movie was so dark that I couldn't tell which character was currently on screen and what they were doing... The movie was definitely very slow but plot was interesting enough to get me to complete it"
"143",1.5,"  When sending of a female only team in to an unknown alien zone... It turns in to a bitchfight where everyone relies on feelings and mistrust. Like when something grabs a member of your team, every one drop your guns and jump in the water. When a big bearthing grabs someone and you find their feet/boots... let's track her/it... but I go alone why? well I just do! It's annoying when a woman acts stupid in a movie... it's worse when its an all female cast and they all do!"
"144",2.5,"  2.5 stars is generous"
"145",2.5,"  Existential navel-gazing meets a pseudo Lovecraftian jungle setting. Perhaps an attempt at the eternal question of what an Earth-centric extraterrestrial encounter would be like if it was a hostile biological one and not all warm and cuddly like E.T. Laboriously plotted with an ending more unwelcome and confounding than Kubrick's ""2001"".Take in another viewing of either the original ""Solaris"" or ""Stalker"" if heady subjective sci-fi is on the menu."
"146",5,"  A visually stunning and complex sci-fi film! One I am still digesting after having seen it last night. Some scares and gross moments but easily one of the best surprises this year."
"147",5,"  This movie's trailer is very misleading. I would describe it more as a thoughtful sci-fi adventure. It was both beautiful and creepy in almost a Lovecraftian way. This isn't a straight up horror movie though, don't expect jump scares or ghosts or anything. It's more alien than that, and I mean that in the sense of the environment. Basically something hit a lighthouse and it's growing shimmer that nobody's come out of and that won't ruin anything. That's the beginning to give you an idea. I was captivated the whole time and can't believe that some of the ideas in this movie weren't thought of before."
"148",4.5,"  Great, weird, creepy, smart, horror, scifi movie. More people should see it."
"149",0.5,"  Not that great. The acting fell short-- and there were several pauses to ""check the boxes"" for political reasons. It was obvious and rather jarring. Plus the complete lack of realism and attention to detail. They should've hired a military consultant. I can suspend disbelief, but not this much."
"150",3,"  freakin lens flare!! movie was okay"
"151",5,"  Beautiful concept and really interesting movie. I loved it!"
"152",4.5,"  This film is incredibly intelligent and artistic. I highly recommend it."
"153",2,"  87%? How much are they paying you? Oh it'll leave you pondering alright... ""What the Hell was that about/How are they going to end this one/And the point is....? Goes nowhere."
"154",2,"  I try to give film adaptations of books a fair chance, but this one really missed the mark. If you have to cut major plot points and scenes out because they ""are not filmable"" then maybe you shouldn't film at all. A gripping and beautifully written horror / sci-fi novel became an utter mess in translation to the big screen. Not a surprise in a time where original films are a rarity."
"155",0.5,"  Another film dripping with blatant and predictable SJW themes thrown in your face by the obnoxious and hypocritical Hollywood elite. A boring script combined with terrible acting makes this movie a must miss."
"156",0.5,"  I normally steer clear of movies with ""what-if-the-world-were-to-end-like-this"" and ""what-if"" strange alien takeover-type plot premises, but hey, you never know. I loved ""Live, Die, Repeat,"" which starred To Cruise no less. And the critics loved this film apparently. I have MoviePass, so I went ahead and checked it out. It was just... so... bad, though. I wish I could have my two hours of my life back. It was just pointless. There's not much else to say. A couple actually walked out of the film about halfway through. There was just nothing about this film that made it worth seeing."
"157",0.5,"  D-. This movie was absolute trash. It insulted me as a viewer often. The concept was horrible, the acting was bad, and the script was worse. The whole movie was ""artsy fartsy metaphors"" that didn't click with me even after watching an explanation video. It's just dumb all around."
"158",5,"  In my top ten movies of all time!!"
"159",5,"  Slowly uniting character motivation and setting, to the point of dissolving the separation completely. Would recommend."
"160",4.5,"  So here's the thing with Annihilation, it's really hard to put a finger on what it really is, but it has a certain vibe to it that sets your mind loose, that very feeling is carefully shaped by Alex Garland, the way he writes is mind-blowing, he makes the obvious sounds and feels mysterious, with this film everything is set right and acted and executed beautifully but ultimately you feel like something is off much like the film's unfoldings which leads me to think that Garland wanted it that way and that's brilliant.Natalie Portman performs elegantly as she carries us through an array of feelings and emotions and that displays her full range, she's a very talented actress to say the least.Alex Garland once again brutally challenges our minds and dares us to think wildly and that's exactly what this genre should be all about, I feel like it's very necessary to think about the unknown and films like that are as close as we're gonna get for now at least.Films like Annihilation are very hard to describe not due to complexity but it's because it's meant to be felt and experienced rather than be understood and that right there is amazing, All in all, Annihilation is extremely good and definitely worth watching."
"161",3.5,"  It's all thematics, without heart. I enjoyed the spectacle of the movie without particularly caring a bit for their fates. High-concept sci-fi is my totally in my wheel-house, so little of what this movie was after went over my head; it's just that immediacy of the narrative needs to inspire the audiences introspection into the nuances of the film so to allow a generative dialog with the audience that persists long after the movie is over. If you don't care/identify with any of the characters, the movie comes of as a sterile experience and will fall flat despite all it merits. Annihilation was lots of merits, but I think it will fall of deaf ears for most. That said, I love that risky high-concept sci-fi is still able to get attention. Annihilation, despite its flaws, is totally worth your time."

"163",0.5,"  Steaming pile of manure"
"164",4.5,"  A gorgeous and haunting tale of self-destruction, Annihilation makes the audience question their definition of evil. Aside from minor pacing issues and serviceable dialogue, the film offers an intense, thought provoking experience that will alienate some of the more casual movie-going audience."
"165",0.5,"  Perfect movie to sleep to."
"166",0.5,"  Not an entertaining movie. Most viewers will NOT like the movie. It's slow, contrived, and annoyingly predictable. But that is not mean it's a bad movie. Overall, it is a mediocre film. And nothing more. What makes it a bad product as a whole is the fact that the story is a less-interesting ripoff of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Colour Out of Space"". Any reviewer or critic calling this film a ""Masterpiece"" is written by either a woman and/or a SJW Shill, who gave the movie 5-Stars before they even saw it simply because it had a female cast. The film is mediocre at best. Enjoy it (or don't) for what it is."
"167",2.5,"  it's a 2 hours Bjork music video starring Natalie Portman"
"168",1,"  it sucked. So slooooow and quiet. don't know how someone can make a movie so boring with so many characters without personalities and think others would want to watch it. did the people who make this film even watch it?"
"169",1.5,"  It was ok...really weird. Wait for it to come out on dvd or bootleg. Thought"
"170",1,"  Most pointless, boring movie ever."
"171",4,"  My buena, intersante Sci-Fy movie"
"172",5,"  Absolutely incredible. The entire film itself was a reflection of the theme on mutation: it subtly mutated from drama to sci-fi to horror and back again, unnerving the viewer with each unexpected shift; it disturbs for the same reason the creatures and order within the Shimmer disturbs: it defies and refuses to follow the natural laws of what typically trust to expect. I understand why someone who wants to see a tidy sci-fi action movie would leave thinking this is a muddled mess, but it was so much more. As a biologist, this movie was incredible to watch, and spoke to so many of my constant thoughts on the tension between our brain's need to construct a sense of permanence as we move around this world (our personal narratives, the physical presence of our bodies, our inability to truly comprehend death) and the fact of the matter that the natural world and our inherent biology is simply a constant assault on any sort of stasis. Physically, we are different people at the end of each day with cell death and cell growth. Mentally, we are different people each year with the burden of new experiences. This movie took that tension and amplified it (and sped it up) to an incredible degree, using this to showcase how life is ultimately death is ultimately life, and that any sense of boundaries or borders that we may imagine as bodies with skin to close us off from the world is nothing but a lark: we are permeable bags of organic matter, and every minute that passes leaves us changed. Whew, this movie. There are a hundred other themes to speak on, including our inherent bent toward self destruction - the ego's way of coping with the incomprehensible fact of our ultimate demise - getting in one's own way, the weight of new experiences, the profound indifference of nature (watching this film took me back to my first read of Steven Crane's ""The Open Boat""), mutations, etc. TL;DR: If you're looking for a tidy sci-fi action flick, this isn't it. If you're fascinated by the natural world, and wonder about the tension between our brain's need for a sense of status and the inherent chaos and assault of constant change by the natural world on everything it entails, check this out. Whether you love it or not, it'll make your brain buzz for a little while, at least, and it's a whole lot of fun."
"173",5,"  excellent movie , deep meaning ,Directed wonderful"
"174",3,"  What a weird movie. Story was interesting enough but nat port was just a robot the whole time. Not that she needed to be a HYSTERICAL woman or anything but put some feeling into what would be a terrifying event."
"175",3,"  While the creativity and imagination is high, felt like would've been better with a different director. Some bad examples of acting too."
"176",2,"  bi de hepsini feminist yapal?m abi!... o zaman √ßekiyoruz."
"177",2,"  The harder they try to make these movies 'deep' and 'thought provoking' the more they make them predictable and boring. I am guessing IQ points hae dropped radically in the last couple of decades or I am getting insanely smart, but this movie was worse than Arrival in the predictability scale and way off the chart on the yawn scale. Brief: Something weird is happening and has been for over a year, gonna consume the earth eventually. They keep sending in people and equipment but none come back. Problem 1 no scientific approach or control. Problem 2 in desperation they send in a crack pot team of suicidal emotional women (literally). Only one survives, but does she. I was asleep and knew the ending about half way through. Yawn."
"178",5,"  Probably the best Lovecraftian horror film ever made; this is a classic piece of sci-fi horror cinema. And it features a cameo of a creature from Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun!"
"179",4.5,"  The annihilation was really astonishing movie for me. As somebody said earlier: just like a nightmare. Really really good sound- and musiceffects. (The music in the lighthouse..omg. it gives me goosebumps. I'll give 4 and a half because I don't exactly know why those romantic bed story appearing?!..."
"180",5,"  Exactly the type of thrilling yet thought provoking story we need to see more of"
"181",5,"  A spectacle of a film. One of the most beautiful films I have seen in a very, very long time. The stunning visuals soothe into the depths of a truly scary and intense story, equal parts heartbreaking and terrifying. There is no reason not to see this movie in theaters. Natalie Portman leads a stellar cast, and Alex Garland is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite directors. Check it out."
"182",5,"  This isn't one for the spoon fed moviegoer, and thank goodness. Annihilation is the next installment in films that can truly be called cosmic horror. Taking its place along others such as Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing, Annihilation succeeds in raising the bar that much more. An excellent blend of cerebral and tactile fear with a surprisingly soft and human side. One leaves the theater with an unease of what is real."
"183",5,"  aS TOUGHT PROVOKING AS IT IS THOUGHTFUL, aNNIHILATION IS AN AMAZING MOVIE THAT TAKES THE AUDIENCE ON AN IMAGINATIVE JOURNEY OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH ALIEN LIFE QUITE UNLIKE THE ONE WE'RE USED TO ON OUR PLANET."
"184",5,"  garland is one of the most interesting filmmakers in the market at the moment and this film is another successful venture for him, but it is not the book by any means. I loved the book and while this film has the soul of the overall arc, it never hits the same beats which might disappoint hardcode fans of the book. the film is a cerebral mind bending experience that will leave you scratching your head, much like the book and I think this will alienate the audience. I am calling this as a film that will be on top 10 lists within the next 20 years, this is Kubrick colours and visual art at the tallest order, a modern cult film that will linger with filmgoers. I mentioned the book earlier and I'm slightly annoyed that this robbed the audience of seeing that book adaption. this changes everything and as a huge fan of the book it annoys me that they only keep the name and distance themselves from the book which begs the question of buying the rights to the book. this reminds me of Kubrick and king tension after the shining opened, if I was vandermeer I would be slightly annoyed that this film failed to capture the true story of the book, the next books continue the mystery and they will never see the light of day on film due to this film changing so much. 20-03-2018."
"185",3.5,"  Amazing performance of Natalie Portman..and a great directing., A little dark movie.. complicated in very simple way.."
"186",5,"  Loved it. loved it. loved it. left me thinking. left me baffled. left me confused but not too confused. left me in awe. what a bizarre and engrossing movie. i was with it from start to finish. loved the story of self destruction. loved the biologicall and cancer aspect to it. loved the mental aspect to it. all of our physical and mental tendencies to self destruct are fascinating. the connection that natalie portman and oscar isaac had at the end when both of there eyes lit up with the shimmer, to me that confused the whole thing a bit. who was the alien she was facing at the end. i think it was 25% alien 75% natalie portmans self destructive nature. it was her own self destruction that was fighting her living/fighting being. when she defeats the alien, i was asking the question, 'Who are we with out of self destructive habits? with our flaws and ticks and problems? who are if we strip ourselves of what may be strongest force within or DNA, our capacity and insistence on self destruction? self destruction by any and all means. addiction, alcoholism, poor choices, spite, jealousy, laziness, depression. We define ourselves and lets ourselves be defined by the self destruction within all of us. who are we if we rid ourselves of that. in a way we are a shell of ourselves.'i loved how the alien didnt really have any interest in what was happening. It didnt have a particular stake in the game. was only acting in its own organic process. it never became the outright villain. it never cheapened itself by relying on villainy and trope.question: if natalie portman killed the alien at the end... how did it survive within her and he husband? ... I kind of think it was just a red herring."
"187",4,"  Whenever we end up with a ""what does it all mean""-affair, the key question is what the movie offers next to the talking points of future film school seminars. In the case of Annihilation it's a sleekly directed, lushly cinematic, good old-fashioned journey into the unknown. My kind of sci-fi."
"188",2,"  Long slow moving film"
"189",3,"  The movie starts out terrifically. It creates a great foundation for the film to form and builds direct tension. This voltage can also be kept until 25 minutes before the end. That is a positive aspect. This is what the film creates in which it is very mysterious. ""New"" animal species are discovered, you want to know what this shimmer is and why it spreads. You feel with Lena. You're hoping she'll survive. The movie usually captures very nice pictures, but some CGI effects either look cheap or they should be wanted. But I don't like them. Another problem I have with the movie is that I don't care about all the other characters except Lena. The biggest problem, however, is in my opinion the end (the last 25 minutes). For me, more questions are raised than answered. This does not always have to be bad, because most of the time the film encourages discussion, but in this case it is not so. You just remain completely unaware, you don't know what the film wants to tell you exactly. The film just doesn't seem to be finished. You should have been able to answer a few more questions and omit unnecessary flashbacks from Lena's life. I did not care about them. Nevertheless, the film is very good up to the last 25 minutes and therefore gets 6/10 points."
"190",5,"  This movie was creative, beautiful, and disturbing. I loved every minute of it, I?ve never before possessed such a strong feeling of dread for a character as I have during several scenes in this movie. Absolutely amazing, I recommend it to all sci-fi lovers."
"191",4,"  A thought provoking film with vibrant visuals to hold your attention."
"192",2,"  Imagine throwing a boomerang, and it never comes back to you. That's what watching Annihilation feels like."
"193",3.5,"  Annihilation uses a science fiction narrative to explore the concepts of self-destruction and depression in a way that has never been done. When a meteorite strikes planet Earth, a female team of specialists begin to explore the environmental impact the alien object makes on the surrounding area. I was throughly impressed by the narrative structure, tastefully revealing only enough to keep you satisfied, yet still curious for the duration of the film. Natalie Portman delivers a fantastic performance that will leave you second guessing what you know and believe until the credits roll. Fans of films like Arrival should check out this movie! It will be time well spent."
"194",2.5,"  This movie was... interesting. I have to honestly say I excpected a lot more from it. Since the studios where like: Ohh this movie is too smart for normal movie going audiences. So we better but it on Netflix.Maaan that was the wrong decision. The positive about the movie is actually the visuals and the nearly all female cast. Stand out for me: Natalie, Tessa and Gina. But the story was lacking suspense. Big Time. Also the ""big meaning"" behind this movie wasn't that hard to find out. So to but a movie like that with amazing visuals to netflix is the wrong decision. It would have definitely benefited from the big screens and surround sound of the theater. And since the story wasn't that complicated ( I really excpected a better mistery/ meaning) it would have fitted just fine into the theater."
"195",0.5,"  My IQ dropped 20 points watching this hollow story unfold at a snail pace. They hired Portman but gave her crap material to work with. It was comedic how idiotic these ""scientists"" were and that love story in the center of it... well... still a better love story than TLJ."
"196",5,"  This is a movie worth seeing twice! I went in with almost no clue what it'd be about, thinking it was going to be bland or generic or what have you. And over the course of the movie, it pulled me in and won me over.The second time through, I'd listened to RLM's video on it and brought a close friend who's a huge film buff to watch it with. I paid closer attention to details and understood a lot more of the meaning behind it. I was actually in tears by the end!I've still been thinking about it for over a week now! Normal movies don't do this to me! A part of why it hit so well with me was because I've had a history of depression, which is a major theme of this film. The nature of it, what it does to us and those around us, and it handles all of this in a smart and respectful way that more people need to hear.Plus as a bonus, it has an all-female cast and doesn't draw attention to it! It doesn't feel forced, all of the characters are well-written, well-acted (including Natalie Portman for the most part).I'd say see this when you have the time, but it's almost out of theaters. This movie deserved better. I genuinely hold this above the likes of Alien or The Thing as my favorite Sci-fi film. It means that much to me!"
"197",1,"  Pretentious sci fi trash.Do not bother watching unless you feeling like wasting 2 hours of your life."
"198",3.5,"  ANNIHILATION- 76%Incredibly beautiful and drastically disappointing. Despite having a very creative idea, a good structure, and breathtaking visual effects; Annihilation lacks clarity. I know these movie like some of Darren Arnonofskys movies where the clarity is usually a mystery that the audience has to solve. With that being said, the puzzle pieces are always vibrant for us to figure it out, unlike Annihilation which just made me wonder if these two hours were a nice visual experience but an absolute waste of my time. I get the term""Annihilation"" linked to self-destruction and how these scenes prospered. I just really believe it could have done more with the story. Story wise and execution: 2/3.5Acting: 1.9/2.5Camera Work: 2/2Sound: 1.7/2Overall Score: 3.8/4"
"199",2.5,"  a giant alligator grabs a woman and drags her underwater......I mean like an 800 pound one......and she is rescued. someone didn't do their homework on how to write a movie. But the concept was different and that made it fun to watch. you didn't really know what to expect and so they get a star for suspense. but all in all, kinda boring and dumb."
"200",4,"  This is how you do an all female sci-fi movie (cough cough Ghostbusters 2016). It's a fun movie. If you think you might like it, you probably will."
"201",3,"  It's a great idea for a film, I give credit to the book, but the execution has some problems. The colors, the edition, the CGI, some dialogs on this are terribly ugly and pretentious in a bad way. The final minutes are a joy to watch, but I can¥t ignore some scenes with no other purpose than letting the screenwriter speak in big cliche dialogs. The supporting characters are nowhere to interesting, and the performance of Natalie Portman has highs and lows."
"202",4.5,"  If you just want aliens and explosions then pass this one by. If you want to think and ponder, and wonder about the existential nature of the film then this is for you. IMO: This stunning, interesting thriller-sci fi is a breath of fresh intellectual/artistic air. If you liked The Fountain, Ex Machina, 2001, Intersteller, or Bladrunner then you'll like Annhilation (though I think The Shimmer would've been a better title). The acting, effects, and ideas of the film are great. The ending is definitely weird, not going to deny that. But the bear scene! Holy #%^$! If you want to ignore the deeper, weirder parts of the film, fine, but at least see it for the crazy bear scene... and that's all I'll say about that."
"203",4.5,"  Brilliant display of art and beauty as the camera work and effects are nothing but incredible. A few scenes are hard to understand and follow but the overall story is unique. Some of the scenes are quite scary and gut wrenching if you're into that kinda thing. Looking forward to the sequel."
"204",5,"  I seriously loved this movie. It's been 3 days since I watched it and I'm still scrolling through forums about it.It's true what they say, you'll either love it, or hate it. I absolutely loved it. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time"
"205",5,"  This movie is had me riveted from start to finish and whenit was all overI left the theatre feeling a little freaked out. Worth seeing in the theatre as the music and sound is part of the experience."
"206",5,"  ¬°WHAT A GREAT MOVIE, I do not know how some of you can not appreciate this masterpiece of science fiction, so far I remember the bear"
"207",4,"  It was really creepy, eerie, bizarre and amazing sci-fi suspense mystery! Natalie Portman was outstanding! Ex Machina director Alex Garland's vision was really fantastic! and I loved very unique sound effects! I was almost miss it at the theater... and I'm so glad I saw it! Spooky good time!"
"208",5,"  This film will keep your mind spinning long after the credits roll. And the soundtrack! Amazing! Kinda felt like I was tripping my face off!"
"209",5,"  Very good movie and pretty original overall. Impressive visuals and pretty good acting."
"210",0.5,"  A total waste of a good budget...2 hours of nonsense and boredom. They used the classic mediocre movie makers excuse to explain it : ""movie is too intellectual for mainstream""=calling viewers idiots to justify their mess.."
"211",5,"  Incredible movie with gorgeous cinematography and very good acting. I was completely sucked in from the begining to the end."
"212",2,"  I has so hype for this movie because i read the book that this movie is, SUPPOSEDLY, inspired. I loved the book and i was hoping for a stunnig movie from the directer of the Ex-machina (one of my favoriete movie from 2014). What i get is one visual good movie but with the content of one pseudo-intellectual bullshit movie. That ending was a fucking mess. For the people who didn't read the book (which was completely set aside by Alex Garland), you don't have any idea of a great movie you could have had. The character of the biologist is so great in the book, but in the movie it was a fucking cliche of a character. All the structure of the book, and the misteries of the area X are but better that in the movie. I know my opinion is greatly influnced by my apreciacion of the book, but, i assure you, that if most people had read the book the score of this movie was way lower.ps(sorry for my english)"
"213",5,"  Amazing visuals. Recommend watching in 3D. Packed with symbolism. Not at all what I expected. Most thought provoking movie I've seen in a long time."
"214",5,"  Beginning his career as an author and responsible for the source material of Danny Boyle's The Beach in 2000, Alex Garland then directly ventured into the film industry by doing screenplay's - again with Boyle on 28 Days Later and Sunshine - before he eventually took the reigns himself by making his directorial debut with the magnificent science fiction film Ex Machina in 2014. On this evidence, it's fair to say that Garland has went from strength to strength and his sophomore film, Annihilation, continues that trend. One could even argue that it's his best work yet.Plot: Lena (Natalie Portman), a cellular biologist and former soldier, joins an expedition to uncover what happened to her husband Kane (Oscar Issac) who disappeared during a mission inside Area X - a swampland across the Florida coastline that was hit by a meteor and is now a sinister and mysterious phenomenon that blocks all contact with the outside world. During the expedition, Lena discovers a world of mutated landscapes and creatures that threatens everything we have come to know about science and evolution and threatens not only her life but also her sanity. Based on the first book in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer we are drip fed the events and conundrum of Annihilation in the three stages of the characters' exploration: Area X, The Shimmer and The Lighthouse. Such is Garland's restrained approach, we are kept very much at arms length about what exactly is going as each of these chapters make little sense. When the film does provide some answers, it only opens it up to even more questions and therein lies the craftsmanship and intrigue of this abstract sci-fi fantasy. What's most apparent, though, is Garland's masterful control of pace and mood and it's his attention to these elements that provide the film with genuinely nightmarish possibilities. Area X is a foreboding, inhospitable land where the laws of physics and nature have turned in on themselves as the environment mutates with new and fascinating results. There are plants that share human DNA and result in growths of eerie, man-like tree structures and animals that retain and replicate the screams of the victims they've killed. Everything refracts as our planet, as we know it, is in the process of evolving into something else entirely. It's this very concept that makes Garland's film a terrifying experience. While it's beautifully shot by cinematographer Rob Hardy and boasts some visually stunning scenes it also has atmosphere in abundance. I've seen genre horrors that have failed to capture half of this films palpable feeling of dread and Garland knows exactly how to handle it's unsettling moments while aided with a hugely effective score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury.Harbouring the weighty themes of grief, suicide and self-destruction, Garland borrows heavily from the paranoia of John Carpenter's The Thing and also channels cancer as its psychological device, while many have compared it to Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 metaphysical film, Stalker. Having recently caught up with that, I can definitely see the resemblance. Tarkovsky's film has a more reflective, philosophical tone to it whereas Garland explores a more scientific nature but the two are certainly bedfellows. Like Stalker, Annihilation refuses to provide easy answers and some might even leave the film frustrated with its ambiguity. However, it's this very ambiguous approach that contributes to the film's allure and fascinating premise. Needless to say, those not willing to put in the effort to work through its many layers will be left sorely disappointed and needn't bother at all. In fact, the film's production studio, Paramount Pictures, voiced their concern on it being too intellectual and complicated for the masses and decided not to release it widely in cinemas in fear of losing money. Instead, a deal was struck with Netflix to internationally distribute it on their streaming service. It's such a shame that films as bold and inventive as this are never given the confidence and respect they deserve. Paramount have been fools in their handling and marketing of this and can only hope that the film's reception doesn't suffer as a result.A haunting and genuinely frightening, sci-fi mystery that's as elliptical and unnerving as Tarkovsky's Stalker and as trippy as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey - with a plethora of other science fiction influences thrown in for good measure. It's only March but already we have one of the potential best films of 2018. This is a truly bold and intriguing undertaking from Alex Garland and he's laid down the gauntlet for the forthcoming year. Mark Walker"
"215",1,"  An amazing and colorful setting that unfortunately didn't use its full potential. And while some scene transitions were too fast, at other times the pacing was awful and slow. Also starting the movie with a dialogue that explains how the movie ends, doesn't excuse the very predictable plot."
"216",4.5,"  At a time where critics complain about reboots, sequels, and cinematic universes, and the audiences that eat up these corporate movie ventures, I am saddened to see this movie failed to draw in a large sum at the box office. An incredibly unique sci-fi film led by all female talent, playing smart, strong scientists all helmed by an exceptionally talented director who displayed his ability in Ex-Machina, this movie should have been everything we wanted. But it didn't seem to fill the gap it sought to fill, and the studio lacked faith in the film to even give it an international wide release. But, I recommend it. See this movie. It is a disturbing, at times scary, smart sci-fi movie that fills that need that movies like Alien have created. It isn't perfect, but hardly a film is and it is definitely worth the watch for the novelty of seeing something original."
"217",5,"  If you like movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, or Intersteller, you'll love Annihilation. A movie with more questions than answers, that will have you hunting around message boards for more clues. Fantastic soundtrack, performances, cinematography, and story."
"218",3.5,"  The condensation of three books worth of material will necessarily exclude things, but this movie excluded something that I thought was crucial to the books, hence the 3.5 stars. Bear creature was awesome, and upon rewatching I might add another 0.5 stars - It's metaphors are still sinking in."
"219",2,"  Un finale ridicolo in una sceneggiatura molto debole. Buone le musiche e la fotografia"
"220",4,"  Critics are by and large on board with Annihilation. Audiences however have been more split. Even the people I know personally are coming out strongly either for or against it. Normally, those are the kind of movies that I find myself feeling in the middle about. You know, the movies that people say ""You either love it or you hate it, there is no middle ground!""? Yeah, those are the sort of thing I almost always end up giving a five or six out of ten. But with this one? I fall very, very firmly on the side in favour of Annihilation. I did love it.Aesthetics is a big part of that, I'm not gonna lie. I'm also digging the chimeric creature design I've seen on Netflix so far this year (in both this and The Ritual). But the philosophical stuff is what really does it for me. Annihilation approaches its context in a completely original way, and I for one feel richer for having seen it."
"221",5,"  It is rare for me to see a movie in theaters. However my girlfiriend and I both watch this movie and absolutely loved it. the sci-fi/thriller/horror themes were backed up by the visuals and universe created during the run time. I enjoy trying to figure out a movie as it goes and Annihilation catered to the need and then some. scientific minds will love this movie and its VARYING twist."
"222",2,"  Annihilation had a concept that although it was very interesting, it didn't do much to help save this movie from being a beautiful-looking, poorly-paced mess that went all over the place with asking more questions than answering them which was really bothersome and almost none of the characters to care for. It's better than Arrival though."
"223",4,"  visually stunning with fascinating, thought provoking material. pacing was slow at times but deliberate and rewarding in the end."
"224",3.5,"  The movie was extremely strange, in the best way possible, visually, it was astounding. The effects were A+. However some parts were a little eerie, and the music was okay."
"225",5,"  Interesting subject, and the way the develop the story is quite good, kept me going on whats coming and the graphics are fantastic, kudos to audiovisuals"
"226",1,"  One of the worst movies I have ever seen."
"227",0.5,"  Stop calling movies with zero to mediocre science behind them ""Science Fiction""!!"
"228",5,"  If you only saw the trailer for ""Annihilation"" you'd think it's another shock and shooting horror flick wrapped in a thinly veiled google-deep-dream scifi wrapper. But it is SOOO much better than that. It is a terrifyingly vivid and raw demonstration of what ""life"" is at it's core, and how the tendrils of its outward expression fractal into everything that makes us, kills us, and will replace us. In the film these soul rattling and seemingly urgent concepts are expressed through and alongside the same backdrop of deep-dream surreal beautiful scramblings and Time/space/ego-melting that accompany them when they arrise from high doses of hallucinogens.In other words, if you have taken high doses of hallucinogens and wished there was a film that could accurately portray the beauty and the terror in a way that maintains a meaningful form even into the sober side - watch this film If you have not taken high doses of hallucinogens and wondered what the fuck your druggie friends meant by ""it's like we're all connected man, but like in a fractal way"" then also watch this film."
"229",4,"  A very interesting and unique movie, with a lot to digest and think about. The trailer was grossly misleading about the context of the movie, which probably hurt it a lot at the box office. I highly recommend watching this one, it is part Arrival, 2001 and Twilight Zone wrapped into one ;)"
"230",1.5,"  Sadly slow and frequently make no sense."
"231",5,"  Mind-bending sci-fi expedition in to a twisted world of spacial anomalies, qauntum distortions and alien visitations.It was a head f*?? but I loved it"
"232",4,"  Awesome movie. Edge of your seat thriller, creepy, scifi, creative thriller."
"233",5,"  A Very good movie! Interesting and visually awesome. Just a very unique and cool story. A must watch!"
"234",1,"  What a waste of a potentially good sci fi flick! Besides some slow moving scenes here and there and unnecessarily weird flashbacks about infidelity, I was mostly enjoying this movie. Then the final act happened and I realized that this movie was literally about nothing. Nothing at all. Their was no real connection with any of the protagonists and no motivation whatsoever for the antagonists, ie the shimmer and the weird mutations. There was no rhyme or reason to this movie and by the end, you'll be scratching your head not out of a lack of understanding but out of frustration that the answers to the mysteries were so simplistic and nonsensical. I truly can't comprehend why this has such a high critic rating when it is an absolute dud of a movie."
"235",2,"  Another one of those what ifs that could have been so much better with a more experienced director. One of the problems with Garland is that he's idolised as a voice of a generation and so carries a weight of expectation on anything he puts his hand to, along with that there's more a hint of fawning obsequiousness from British reviewers.Ex Machina was relatively tight, set in a confined space with few characters, it did pose some good questions on AI, humanity, and ego, before setting them aside to focus on manipulation and thrills.Annihilation is broader in scope but less interesting, less well structured, and somewhat confused about what it wants to be - tonally it shifts all over the place.It begins with a meteorite hitting earth. It carries a life form that replicates and mutates across species, as well as between plant and animal. Its effects are spreading outwards from the point of impact at an increasing rate, and the edge of its area of influence can be seen as a shimmer. Teams of people have gone into the 'shimmer', but none have ever come out.The one man does, except there's something wrong with him and he's dying. His wife joins up with a team going into the Shimmer in order to get to the source in the hopes that she'll find something that will help.This is all standard fare for Science Fiction - it's kind of The Andromeda Strain meets War of the Worlds meets Contact meets Alien; the basic set up could be told in minutes, but it takes forfuckingever to get its arse in gear. That's a big part of the problem, the film can't decide what tone to take - it starts off as a drama, then tries to switch up gears to being an adventure into the unknown before switching gears again to being a bit more psychological before shifting over to horror and then into some trippy half-bakery.It just doesn't gel as a whole story, it's more a collection of influences strung together in a manner that's less than the sum of its parts.Natalie Portman does well with a character who has to be strong enough to survive but who seems too often to be asked to play her part as over-wrought. She's fearless bringing down sharkgator, but that moment is the only one where she seems in command of herself.Jennifer Jason Leigh rasps her way through things with scene stealing disinterest, which is at least notable. Everyone else is cardboard thin so that by the time they start disappearing one by one, as people in these things are wont to do, it's impossible to care either way.Aside from Sharkgator there's a Cowbear auditioning for a sequel to the Revenant but it fails because it makes a 13yo boy laugh. There's another faux Alien bit that's supposedly gory, but again the boy sees the fakery a mile off and is duly unimpressed. If any of these three scenes were supposed to be thrilling they utterly failed, there's not an iota of tension to the hohumness of the endeavour.This isn't so much a deliberately slow-paced film as a low energy one consumed by indecision."
"236",5,"  I thought this movie was amazing. I would label it as a sci-fi horror. It was definitely creepy at times."
"237",3,"  Ive never felt more uncomfortable walking out of a movie. There isn't a lot of happy moments where you can stop and breathe you just have to take its all at once. The world inside the shimmer is both, beautiful and terrifying. The visuals are stunning, just incredibly done, but it can become very depressing at times."
"238",5,"  There's a lot to love about the film Annihilation, but I think my favorite thing about it is Poe Dameron is married to Queen Amidala. But seriously, go see it. It's fucking awesome. And I may now be in love with Natalie Portman."
"239",5,"  Great syfy thriller movie keeps you guessing until the end even after the movie ends. Great acting script and plot"
"240",3.5,"  Puntaje Original: 6.5Si bien Annihilation evoca una incisiva reflexiÛn a la alteraci√≥n del medio ambiente, este film suele caer en t√≠picos clich√©s de su g√©nero."
"241",0.5,"  This movie believes that being deep is best accomplished by being boring and ambiguous. It has a simplistic plot and inner conflict better suited for an action movie, but trades entertaining special effects for eye-candy special effects that we're all sick of seeing by now. I will not spoil the film by revealing the central conceit it is trying to get across, but I will say that its main idea is utter nonsense, and something I would have expected to show up in one of those teen dramas that pretends to be deep at some point in the third act. Portman phones her part in, and no one else is much better. The camera makes bold moves for the sake of making them and never really asks whether the move was necessary. It's boring, it's long and it ultimately gives a moral that would be laughed off a fortune cookie. One of the worst movies I have seen all year."
"242",1,"  The premise of this movie is great and had so much potential. But the script is appalling and the characters completely crap. Every sentence is designed to be dramatic and emotive which eliminates the sense of disbelief required for a sci-fi because it requires the characters to deviate in behaviour so far from what their roles would require. For example, nobody ever had a monkey on a rope. Not even once."
"243",4.5,"  Still feels it like Ex-Machina. I like visual the ending, it's psychedelic.."
"244",0.5,"  Poorly written and acted film, trying to play the awkward 'diversity' card. Leans heavily on Shiite CGI as the narrative loses direction and hope of cohesion. Haven't seen anything quite this dumb in some time. Perhaps the book is decent but that didn't carry through. Alex G certainly hacked this one - which is unfortunate as his previous work has shown promise. Contrived, shallow and really struggles to convey a decent message. Mass-market plebs and film critics with base intellect may gravitate toward it in their confusion."
"245",4.5,"  This is a damn good movie! Intelligent, well told scifi, with amazing performances and visual effects! Go watch it!"
"246",2,"  Great potential regarding a long term existential angle backed up by science. Due to lack of character development the overall impression deteriorates and the end doesn¬¥t have as much impact as I¬¥d hoped for."
"247",2.5,"  LIke the director's previous film, Ex Machina, Annihilation is very competently directed with amazing visuals, but considers itself to be a much more cerebral film than it actually is. Thankfully, it takes a lot of liberties with the source material however, making it much more enjoyable to watch."
"248",1,"  Seriously one of the worst films I have ever seen. So bad, I can't be bothered to work out what the pretentious deeper meanings are meant to be. It's just not worth the effort. Characters are flimsy and the ludicrous giant crocodile makes Thunderbirds' Attack of the Giant Alligators look like an Oscar-winning classic. The ending is dismally predictible and no doubt a desperate attempt to make the whole witless morass seem vaguely intelligent and meaningful. Which it isn't. Do not waste two hours of your life on this cesspit of a movie...."
"249",1,"  Rotten all the way! Utterly meaningless self-indulgent filmmaking. The Tomatometer is probably talking about a different film!"
"250",0.5,"  This by far is one of the most dumbest movies I've ever seen."
"251",5,"  This is Film-Art at it's best."
"252",3,"  The visuals are psychedelic and there's a sense of eerie suspense that pervades nearly every minute of screen time."
"253",3.5,"  good movie overall... don't know why my caps are on?Anyway it did leave a couple of questions1. why didn't they just take a ship or a tank to get where they wanted to go?2. I'm not sure exactly what happened at the end.. anyway it was interesting and spooky"
"254",3.5,"  As much as I wanted to love this it was OK at best. Portman was great and the movie was well made, but the story just ended up weird."
"255",0.5,"  Wtf, there was barely a point to anything anyone did and they worried more about someone's affair than the shimmer that was consuming existence...stupid writing mixed with awesome visuals. I wish I could have watched it in a foreign language so that I could pretend it made sense."
"256",0.5,"  No words to describe just how bad this movie is."
"257",5,"  Possibly one of the best movies Iv seen in a long time. Had me on edge the whole way through."
"258",3,"  As a person who had read (and is a big fan of) the book, I felt torn. If you have not read the book, go ahead and see the movie. The production design is remarkable, the actors are truly great, the scores are harrowing and on point; all in all, as a movie alone, it's an excellent movie.But, if you've read Vandermeer's book, you would probably dislike or even hate the movie (as I do). Alex Garland was one of my favorite directors, and I couldn't wait to see this movie after hearing that he will be making the adaptation of the novel. And now I don't know what to believe anymore.It's basically him saying to VanderMeer ""I love your book and I'm going to make a movie based on it. But let me change this... and this... and this... You know what? Screw the book. I'm going to make my own watered-down version of it. The book is going to be a trilogy? Nah, one is good.""Some movies are loose adaptations of some books. But I've never seen one that is as drastic as this one. Understandably, it's a highly unfilmable book (How? Read it and you'll understand.) But if it's going to be a very loose adaptation, don't use the same title as the book maybe?On top of that, there's the issue with distributing the movie, with all the Paramount and Netflix things making the movie unavailable in theatres outside of the US.I'm not really sure how much the rating should be. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Not after knowing that the book is so much more enticing, suspenseful, and poetic."
"259",1,"  That was not the book. Please just wait for a cable showing."
"260",0.5,"  If you are a Liberal, you will no doubt enjoy this movie. If not, you will have no idea what was going on."
"261",3.5,"  The film is lengthy, there are some scenes which totally bores you. While the rest of it, is a complete mind fuck. Never knew science could be so eerie. It's a fresh take for sci-fi horrors."
"262",1,"  I'm not sure why this is even titled Annihilation.There are hardly any similarities with the book, the biggest similarity being that Area X exists. Characters, events, ending - all different. If you've read the book, do NOT watch this horrible movie adaptation."
"263",3.5,"  Like 2001, Possession, and Mulholland Drive it was good until it got stupid."
"264",4,"  As a movie on its own rights is good fun with well-told story and even better designs and visuals.But as a fan of ""Southern Reach"" books, I can't understand how Jeff VanderMeer , author of the books, who was as well involved in making the movie, could allow for such changes, The story shown in the movie has nothing to do with the first book and the way it ends makes it impossible to screen the two other parts. Unless they will make them totally different than books.I can only think about ""Solaris"" but at least as far as I know Stanislaw Lem didn't like the way they have changed the whole story.Calling this movie ""Annihilation"", for me, is purely marketing trick. Before watching it I was hoping somebody will make a movie based on another great book by VanderMeer, ""Borne"", but now, if it was the same approach as ""Annihilation"", I will stick with the book.Why change a great into good?"
"265",2,"  The high ratings from RT critics makes me VERY suspect! I really wanted to like this movie.. I really tried. The consensus from all 5 of my companions was the same. We didn't care about any one of the characters, Not even the visuals could save it. A movie about nothing"
"266",2,"  So disappointed. The first half if the movie is great, and it seemed to be going in an interesting direction. Acting was good and some scary moments. But then everything just went crazy and the story fell apart into the complete ridiculous. In the midst of the madness though, the 'twist' ending did somehow manage to still be completely predictable. The most frustrating thing for me however was that to me a lot of the bulk of the story could have had scientific basis, (aside from the ending) but the explanations given are completely ridiculous and beyond any realm of possibility. Sci fi needs to have science, and just because this movie features scientists who use the right buzz words, does not ground the plot in any actual science. So frustrating to start watching a movie that seems brilliant initially and for the ending to just be complete crap."
"267",4,"  Not just an action/adventure/sci-fi movie. This explores the effects of exposure to the unknown and doesn't wrap it up neatly or give us pat answers. Hard to describe without dropping spoilers, and spoilers wouldn't help anyone understand the movie better anyway. May need to be seen more than once to be understood - and even that may not make things clearer. Definitely worth the ride, though."
"268",2,"  Don't see it hungover -- loud, bright, corny, and twenty minutes too long."
"269",0.5,"  This was - and I say this without hyperbole - the worst film I have ever seen."
"270",0.5,"  Dialogues and 90% of movie is completely weak. Visual effects are so-so. Script and whole story is not awfully bad, but I can't say it's good. Long story short please don't watch this unless you wanna see someone's bad trip."
"271",2,"  I can't give this movie any more credit, because it's such a letdown from the world and atmosphere of the book. My greatest disappointment is that no worthier movie will be possible for the Annihilation series for many years because of one flagrantly disloyal adaptation. A cool aesthetic? Yes, but Garland trades a consuming ambiguity and communal breakdown for a shallower, more traditional ambiguity and some cheap monster moments. The difference as I imagine it is between a monster with the mystique of Jaws and a Prometheus of plentiful but inconsequential horrors."
"272",5,"  Cinco estrelas n√£o s√£o duficientes, est√° muito √† frente do seu tempo. Do melhor que j√° foi feito nas √∫ltimas d√©cadas."
"273",0.5,"  Utter shite. Also ruined by SJW and feminist dogma. The unrealistic diverse cast actually ruins the film. Plus 5 wammen who are the action heros is way too forced.Skip it and save 140 mins of your life to do something useful."
"274",5,"  Annihilation is a rare treat for those that love exciting and intelligent movies. It is full of beautiful imagery, bad ass women, and perhaps the most terrifying antagonist I have ever seen. Just like the primordial soup that gave birth to life on Earth, the ""shimmer"" has arrived by accident and is driven without logic or meaning towards a will to live. The expression of this idea is marvelously executed and a feast for the eyes. I've seen it twice and both times the theater was nearly silent. Everyone was glued to the screen and waiting with bated breath as the story unraveled chaotically, mysteriously, perfectly in front of us."
"275",1,"  Honestly, I don't UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH A BAD MOVIE GET SO MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS. NOT ONLY IT'S PREDICTABLE AND BORING, BUT THE CGI AND CINEMATOGRAPHY IS HORRENDOUS - FAR WORSE THAN, SAY, IN nETFLIX'S OWN mUTE."
"276",4.5,"  Alex Garland supplies us with yet another mind-blowing cinematic movieexperience in Annihilation. The visuals and camera shots are well thoughtout. The friend I saw the film with, even noted that things looked like theywere often being viewed through a lenses or a window which was interesting.The story is gripping, which is impressive for a movie with very little actionsequences involved altogether. Natalie Portman also gives an exceptionalperformance, one I didn't know she was capable of alongside Oscar Isaac."
"277",4.5,"  Face the real Fear! the ending is amazing"
"278",2.5,"  Pretty to look at, otherwise unremarkable"
"279",5,"  A very fresh area of sci-fi exploring concepts of alien conciousness by evolution. The characters were very believable, great acting."
"280",4.5,"  One of the most intelligent thought provoking sci go movies I've seen..not hyperbole or recency bias..genetics..and humanity's unstoppable need..to self destruct ourselves..cannot wait to have intelligent conversations with someone about this movie endlessly"
"281",2,"  Why did scienstist act so stupid?"
"282",4,"  Weird sci-fi concoction. Unusual, challenging and scary. Me likes."
"283",3,"  A thinking mans movie with some stunning visauls and great music that could have been fantastic but unfortunately lacks a good setup and suffers from the pacing being off at more than one point."
"284",4,"  Annihilation straddles the line between cerebral film-making and the plain bizarre. The result is consistently engaging and thought-provoking even when its own obscurity works against the story."
"285",3.5,"  Annihilation could have been a great sci-fi but a few things hold it back from achieving it's potential. The plot follows a group of scientists as they enter into a mysterious shimmer to try and find it's cause, well aware that no expedition has yet returned, with the exception of Lena's husband. The cast do a great job throughout the film with Natalie Portman unsurprisingly being the standout performer as Lena.Visually, this is a stunning film. The CGI might not be the best but considering the films moderate budget but a good enough job is done to create a world that feels alive and coupled with films soundtrack, quite haunting. Extra kudos goes to the bear, which is responsible for the most tense and chilling moment throughout this film.Unfortunately though, there are couple of faults that stop this from being great. Firstly, there are several flashbacks into Lena's past that don't really work. They tell a backstory that doesn't really need to be told and as a result just feel like unnecessary padding to help drag out the runtime. The biggest issue though is the ending. Whilst the very last scene is well done, the build up to the events didn't really work for me. The climax felt quite out of place with the rest of the film and verging on pretentious.Despite these flaws though, there is still plenty here to keep sci-fi fans amused and make Annihilation a worthwhile watch."
"286",2,"  Belle esthetique mais lent de chez lent. Assez ennuyeux."
"287",4.5,"  A film that managed to cram so much into so little. I would definitely say that a background in science might better serve in your understanding and/or appreciation of this film; however, it is definitely not required."
"288",1.5,"  The film suffers from continual vacillation between the current storyline and flashbacks. It also significantly lacks scoring. The first rule of science fiction is the mandate to suspend disbelief. This film fails at that task badly."
"289",1,"  Slow, lazy, boring and pretentious.Essentially this movie is about going from point A to point B, with dropping of backpacks whenever possible. Occasional events that happen during journey do not contribute to story in any way. As result both story and its conclusion are exceptionally boring and confusing(mild leanings into supernatural, instead of completely plausible scientific explanations, do not help either), as practically nothing relevant have any explanation or even hint at explanation. Few short scenes that give glimpses into events that happen in the Shimmer are not unpacked in any way and serve more as a filler. Only meaningful conversation that even attempts to explain Shimmer lasts about 2 minutes. Rest of them are either recollections of past life or are pointless banter. Neither have nay relevance to story.Annihilation is so open-minded that viewer mind simply shuts down at some point as there is no pieces to connect together. Every time some pattern starts to emerge whole thing takes 180 and goes in completely different direction. Ending is completely disconnected from rest of the movie and as result do not make any sense. If there was some grand idea behind this film, then i fail to see it, even glimpse of it. Its just lazy, relaying on viewer imagination to fill all those huge plot and logic holes in non-existing storyline.After watching thru it 3 times, in attempt to find some hidden meaning, initial reaction of ""What was the point of all this ?"", be it bone jigsaw in front of lighthouse or memory card at old base, did not really change in the slightest. Whole thing can be described in one sentence - ""something something Shimmer, something something lighthouse""."
"290",5,"  captivating and thought-provoking. Love it."
"291",2,"  inconsistency in this movie is so bad. ex- soldier made so many bad decisions. ""scientists"" which doesn't collect any evidence. only good side are special effects"
"292",5,"  such an amazing concept . although it has a slightly slow pacing but everything is worth the mysterious end that leaves you wondering ' what the f did i just watch ?! ' ... Great direction , brilliant cast and just mind blowingly beautiful visuals !"
"293",2.5,"  While I liked the premise of the film. 5 women trekking into a wilderness which as been transformed into an unknown, alien landscape. Following in the footsteps of the men and tech that have gone before them and disappeared. The film, though well acted and visually beautiful, fails to connect with the viewer on an emotional level. It is also super serious in tone but without the emotional weight behind those levels of seriousness, the film comes across as pretentious. Ultimately, the ending falls very flat. The 'what happens now?' questions the director expects the audience to ask turn into 'Thank god that's over, there's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back..."" Disappointing."
"294",0.5,"  Utter garbage. Nothing happens apart from a mechanical monster wheeled in about an hour in. Gave up and switched this off. You will too."
"295",4.5,"  Garland delivers another great film, filled with stunning special effects, steady performances and impeccable direction which makes Annihilation one of the best sci-fi movies I seen recently"
"296",4.5,"  Best movie of 2018 so far!"
"297",5,"  Beautiful and awesome, one of those movies you take with you and can't thinking about and reanalyzing.."
"298",4.5,"  Not a dull moment and great character developments. Not too little, not too much. Great visual effects and a plot the keeps you guessing"
"299",1.5,"  I think the ""professional"" critics haven't read or watched enough good Sci-Fi to know what good mystery horror sci-fi should be like. The PC finger prints are all over this pot boiler, it's distracting and unnecessary, enough with the ""Mary Sues"" already. One of the characters points out the glaringly obvious with putting females in combat situations, stating, ""Shit is heavy, can't carry this"".The macguffin was interesting until it became a parody of itself, and reflected badly on everyone involved in this mediocre Sci-Fi romp. One thing is certain, Sci-Fi fans will watch this, because you have to watch, just in case it's one of the few rare gems you might find these days.If you love science in your science fiction, this movie will disappoint. If you love fantasy in your Sci-Fi you might get more out of this than I did. It's not a ""Cloverfield"", but it's certainly no ""Alien""."
"300",4.5,"  Writer-director Alex Garland has always leaned towards intricate ideas that ask a lot but answer little, mainstream audiences be damned. So it's no surprise that Paramount Pictures got cold feet and sold his latest trippy sci-fi to Netflix for international distribution. It's a double-edged sword though: whilst it's great to see Garland's mind-bender relatively quickly after its cinematic release Stateside (a release here would've undoubtedly been delayed), this visually spectacular film would've been an amazing big-screen experience. To attempt a suitably informative plot summary would not only be futile, but would diminish the impact of the narrative and thematic Pandora's box so carefully constructed by Garland (adapting from Jeff VanderMeer's novel). It's as close to undefinable as a movie can get. Suffice to say; however, that we follow a group of complex women - led by Natalie Portman's regret-filled biologist Lena - as they embark into what may or may not be another realm. Toying with time, space and the very fabric of humanity, it is a filmic hallucination that demands your unwavering attention as it subtly weaves in and out of reality, keeping the viewer as off-balance as the leading lady. Moments of pure beauty are juxtaposed against sporadic bouts of visceral terror, the sudden and seamless switching between the two (helped with flawless CGI) maintains a high level of tension until culminating in a hypnotic and unnerving finale that is simply awe-inspiring. The meaning of the climax, as with the movie as a whole, is of course open to interpretation, while the emotional connectivity will depend on one's willingness to ride Garland's wave, but there's no denying the ambition - and dare I say, genius - on display. Annihilation does what every great sci-fi tale should: intrigue, enthral, provoke and challenge."
"301",3.5,"  Idk how I feel about it. It is okay."
"302",2,"  I wanted to like this movie so much but it was a letdown in so many ways. The plot twist could be seen from a mile away and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know what the hell the Critics were smoking when watching this."
"303",1.5,"  Boring. Waste of acting talent on mediocre script, poorly directed."
"304",4.5,"  This is one of those rare movies that really makes you contemplate what it means to be human. With genetic manipulation from an alien force, this movie serves as a chilling horror as well as a sci-fi thriller. While the beginning of the movie spoils some of the beats it actually plays out better that way in the end because it makes you think of the ways the events were described by the protagonist. Very well done in that aspect, many of the shots I thought were odd choices. For example during scenes of dialogue early on the camera would be too low cutting off portions of their heads, this is a very minute thought for an overall good watch. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about the movie, it's gripping and intense throughout, the main character is not just a typical horror movie character who makes stupid decisions, this character is actually smart and has a military background which serves some use against some genetically altered monsters. I highly recommend this movie for any horror lovers and especially those who movies that provoke thought long after the ending."
"305",4.5,"  at first this seems like one of those odd ball self funded sci fi movies but it grows on you (pardon the pun). And the (mostly) all woman cast shows that the recent sci fi tv revolution of having female leads and co-leads is finally moving into movies."
"306",0.5,"  Sick of these DISHONEST reviews by these so-called ""critics"". Hollywood must be getting desperate. This movie was garbage with really bad graphics."
"307",2,"  This film tries to be deep, it tries to be interesting, it tries to be different and It does this all in a bad way. I was looking forward to this movie because I saw that most people liked it and critics loved it. It's a lie everyone, don't waste your time. It's hard to even talk about this film because I got nothing out of it. It has been a while since I've seen a stinker because I research and try to find other opinions and if they are good I watch the film. I tried to be in denial after this movie because I was sad that it wasn't good. I wanted this to be great but It didn't turn out that way. Disappointment is the word that I would describe this movie. It was confusing and unstructured. It's super artsy but it doesn't have a good story or developed characters. The CGI is bad and the editing is decent. People travel from one place to a whole other area in the span of a cut at one point. This is a cinematic clusterfuck."
"308",5,"  As a fan of the novels, I've been highly anticipating Annihilation, and it was worth the wait. This movie changes the narrative more than enough to separate itself from the novel with it's great performances, stunning visuals, interesting and mysterious story, and scares. The film was very enjoyable to watch and pretty immersive, however I did find there was a formula to advance the plot once or twice which became a little noticeable but didn't cause any issues. And similar to the novel, it left viewers wondering and pondering over the film's mysteries and events which will lead into the next film, making it a film to remember for quite a while. Overall, Annihilation is a fantastic film with a strong story and well performed and leaves the viewer desiring for more."
"309",4.5,"  Como una adaptaciÛn de El color que cay√≥ del cielo mezclado con Stalker de Tarkovski."
"310",4.5,"  Visually stunning, beautifully acted and spot on direction and editing, it almost makes me forgive Netflix for Bright, it was so good.. The story reminded me a bit of JG Ballard's novel 'The Crystal World At times surreal, others a human drama and occasionally truly terrifying, it can be difficult to watch some scenes, the tension is so ratcheted up. The presence of both Isaac and Portman show that there is survival after the reprised Star Wars franchise which, for my money are the worst sci-fi movies ever. Now they've made good on the debt to us nerds by being in one of the best."
"311",2,"  This movie never came together for me.The women did every illogical act except wear stilettos in the woods. The ending that was supposed to chill me was so redundant. I want me 2 hours back. the kettle corn was excellent, though."
"312",1.5,"  very confusing, couldn't understand the ending, waste of time would recommend not to watch!!!"
"313",4,"  I can certainly see why this film is so divisive but for my own part I really liked it and I think it's a shame that I couldn't have enjoyed it in the cinema. It's visually stunning, brilliantly acted and a story that follows its own arc and not conventions. The story really pulled me in, it was very thought provoking, clever, tense and I really wasn't sure where exactly it would go next which is refreshing to say. The musical score also helps add to the tension. It is slow paced but it's what the movie needed to slowly unfold the mystery and I didn't feel myself get bored for one moment. The ending is ambiguous and leaves unanswered questions but I think that only adds to the intrigue and fits the overall tone of the film. I won't proclaim this as a masterpiece but it is an amazing film and if Ex Machina was a hit with you, then I'm sure there's a good chance that you may like this too."
"314",4,"  Not the movie the mainstream will want to see, which is a shame, because it is really well done."
"315",2.5,"  Interesting & original film. I didn't really like it, as I wasn't on drugs, which maybe required. They (drugs) may not help you comprehend this film, but it may help you enjoy the screen saver during the final credits.If I see it again, I'll try & enjoy some mushroom soup with a poppyseed muffin before."
"316",1.5,"  Give me back my two hours."
"317",0.5,"  Seriously dull and could do with some kind of plot"
"318",5,"  Wonderful film - just don't watch the trailer! Takes away from the suspense and magic. Good, thought provoking film that delivers genuine thrills and chills in a time so stuffed with brain-dead jump scares and non-cerebral cinema. Do films of the future a favour, go see it!"
"319",5,"  One of the best science-fiction films in years, Alex Garland directs to shear perfection, with stunning cinematography, an ambitious and mind-boggling script, and terrific performances from Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh prove that this is a film for the ages, get ready to be rocked. This film grabs you by the shoulders and doesn't let go for a second."
"320",0.5,"  don't waste your time. gibberish."
"321",1,"  If I could give this one-tenth of 1 star, I would. I haven't passionately hated a movie like this in so long. I mean, I am still seething about it 5 days later. I love sci-fi, but this movie was a colossal nightmare. I don't understand the high critic rating. They called this one wrong, and I can't get back two hours of my life. I kept waiting and waiting for the pay off and ZILCH. Atrocious waste of a movie. Natalie Portman's performance is the only positive I have for this debacle."
"322",1,"  Ok it's an audacious movie but in my opinion he is just weird.All actions are wtf, you're not link to the characters, and the end is just waaaaaay to long !You have to be very very very open-minded ! Maybe with an other actress than Nathalie Portmann, people would have rated it as bad as me."
"323",3.5,"  ""Annihilation"" is a swamp of special effects. Nevertheless, at most occasions it manages to look absolutely stunning & colourful. It's obvious that imagination (& post-production department) had to work overtime to create the film's inhabiting world. The film's concepts, though imaginary, are clearly rooted in & explained by the use of biology, geology & psychology. The film reflects life as it is, sometimes mesmerizing & sometimes horrific. The only downsides of ""Annihilation"" are the gimmicky-looking action sequences & the under-development of its characters, an aspect that leaves viewers disinterested about said characters' fate.(Updated from 13/03/2018)"
"324",4,"  Annihilation on the surface sounds more violent than it actually is but there are some gore moments like when a woman with a lot of feminine angst takes a machine gun and blows away a giant mutant alligator. Let me tell you if you are ever wondering whether Natalie Portman can handle a machine gun I can answer you the affirmative yes and it is quite cool. Make no mistake, it's an Estrogen pumped film, and with a strong-willed female protagonist that perhaps could win an Oscar as well. Natalie Portman's performance is outstanding and supporting characters did a good job as well. Some of the characters go psycho but I guess that's to be expected when you encounter too many flowers and rainbows. This all-lady team sent out to achieve success 'where no man has gone before' (and achieved success) didn't end too well. They go out to the danger zone to solve the mystery and things take a turn for the worse. The five women collectively hit menopause at the same time on a 'very bad day', and meet stressors such as a Mutant Aligator and Giant Bear with a skull head. This and many other unfortunate events remind us that Dorothy is not in Kansas anymore. The visuals were outstanding. Complete with rainbow anamorphic flares, this scifi film was a visual treat and something different and more interesting than the most recent scifi films. Natalie's CG alter ego is taller than her, I get that everyone wants to be taller but this was a bit much, Natalie is a 'shortie'. The special effects of the alter ego were done well and obviously very high budget. The set design was overwhelmingly cool. Very creative flowers and foliage really added to the environment and feel of the film.Overall I'd say it's good storytelling and the film kept my attention which is sometimes difficult to do with adult ADHD onset so early, so 4 out of 5 stars for an engaging film."
"325",2.5,"  I always struggle with stories that toe the line between original and weird, and this is one. It was interesting at times but also had me furrowing my eyebrows at others. Beyond that, the directing was good, the acting was average and the score was unsettling, though probably intentionally. While this film is fascinating at times, it is just get a little too abstract for my liking."
"326",5,"  Very well done. Some good and intellectual scifi. Good concepts involving dna.Reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey."
"327",1.5,"  Decent special effects, but ultimately, it was so lack-luster that I found myself wanting to fast forward to the ending. Not even worthy of Netflixing."
"328",1.5,"  I so wanted to love this movie. I love science fiction. But it was so disappointing. It was as if they said, ""Hey let's make a sci-fi movie that never explains anything, there is no closure and we never find out what anything was."" I kept waiting for something cool to reveal itself - it never did. Just left you hanging."
"329",4.5,"  A great eerie thought provoking film."
"330",0.5,"  I don't get the high score?! It looks very low budget."
"331",4,"  It was good, some things are left unexplained but interesting. One of those movies that would be awesome on acid or shrooms. . But then again why would you want to waste that on a movie from netflix at that, just saying if you have some extra time"
"332",3.5,"  iT'S AN ALRIGHT MOVIE, VERY GOOD PRODUCTION VALUE AND THE ACTING IS GREAT, JUST THE STORY IS A LITTLE FAR FETCHED IF YOU KNOW AS MUCH BIOLOGY AS i DO. GIVEN THAT, IT'S DEFINITELY AN INTERESTING FILM AND ONE OF THE BETTER ONES i'VE SEEN SINCE 2017."
"333",1,"  Absolute terrible excuse for a sci-fi film. Please don't waste your time on this sad excuse for a movie."
"334",3,"  tHE BOOKS WERE EXCEPTIONAL. tHEY WERE HARD TO GRASP AT TIMES, BECAUSE THEY WERE INTENT ON PLAYING WITH OUR COMPREHENSION. iT IS QUITE BEYOND THE MEDIUM OF FILM TO CAPTURE THE STRANGENESS THE BOOKS IMPART. tHAT SAID, THIS IS A VALIANT AND SOMEWHAT EGOISTICAL EFFORT. bY THE LATER i MEAN, IT TAKES AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF SELF CONFIDENCE TO EVEN EMBARK UPON A PROJECT DOOMED TO FALL SHORT. tHE ACTING IS GOOD, (pORTMAN HAS NEVER PUT IN A BAD PERFORMANCE SAVE AT THE CLUMSY HANDS OF mR lUCAS), AND THE EFFECTS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO ASSIST WITH THE STORY. iF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT WRITING AND STORIES, READ THE BOOKS FIRST - i THINK YOU WILL GET MORE OUT OF THE FILM THAT WAY, AS IT REMINDS ME OF POSTCARDS OF THE DESTINATION AND NOT THE THING ITSELF."
"335",5,"  Honestly, it scared the crap out of me. It was weird enough and had that intangible ""something"" that had me still thinking about it days later. It's weird because it is a true sci fi and it is about what would happen if a complete (tiny spoiler - don't read the next five words if you don't want a hint................ alien ""something"" fooled with our DNA,............ because that is what the unknown something probably does naturally. It doesn't tell too much about the unknown something, which might make people frustrated, but honestly it doesn't take away from the film because it's supposed to leave you wondering and thinking and putting it together, and it does, not just about what happened, but about what the unknown something is, what might happen next, why, and a lot more. It gives enough info that I wouldn't ever want to encounter this situation, ever. I'd rather encounter a monster from a monster movie, because you might be able to get away from it. But it was the overall idea and the visuals that somehow made me feel really creeped out (in a good way for a scary sci fi). If a movie leaves me still thinking about it for days, it's a good movie. It's unique, it's thought provoking, and it makes you want to know more. I think it explores the topic of what gives a person their true identity, what happens if that gets tampered with, and at what point does someone stop being who they are. That's what creeped me out. It explores stuff that we don't completely understand ourselves, and made me think about things that are almost out of my comprehension. like how complicated a person's body and mind are, what makes me me, and would I still be me if someone shifted stuff around so I'm not the same me or a version of me. Or if someone clones me, would that be me . I can't explain it. I can just say there's a reason it's creepy and it's hard to explain, but it explores something very thought provoking and frightening. It's a shame that they released it on Netflix first. I couldn't believe I'd seen it on Netflix and then realized it was just coming up in the theater. That's pretty jerky for the studio to do to the producer. I'd go see it in the theater, too, just because I think the producer got a raw deal, but I'm still feeling the creeps from it, and not sure I want to have nightmares tonight. If it doesn't scare you, then you don't understand it. The force or ability of the unknown something, though subtle at first, is more destructive than an atom bomb, and sneaks up on you like a really sly predator that gets you to walk right up to it. The only thing I didn't think was deep was the people's characters, but I don't think that is the goal of this type of movie. The movie is making you wonder who people are (in a general sense) anyway, on purpose, so I think character development maybe wouldn't improve the goal. Maybe I'm wrong. It's just my first thought about it. Overall, I would not forget this movie. It left a strong impression on me. It almost seems to me to be a cross between a sci fi, a horror movie and a something just totally unreal, surreal, bizarre, but still mostly a sci fi because it COULD be possible, if there was an unknown entity with this much power, capable of this type of scientific meddling."
"336",4.5,"  Cerebral and visceral, Annihilation is a film that gets under your skin and begs you to uncover its brilliant layers."
"337",5,"  Outstanding. Stunning visuals, great story. Superb movie."
"338",1,"  Dull, tedious waste of 2 hrs. No coherence, no drama, terrible ending. Just pretentious bits and pieces in some nice cinematography."
"339",3.5,"  Engaged me completely -- the performances were wonderful! The underlying themes of depression and self destruction was powerful. Stunning images that will stay with me. The trailer and marketing sets you up for seeing a different film - which I think can harms the viewer experiance - I would forget the trailer and your expectations when you watch this - allows for a more powerful experience. highly recommend,"
"340",3,"  Alex Garland tries to tap into the essence of Kubrick's ending of 2001 a Space Oddesy. Stunning visuals, loud viseral audio, and questions that go unanswered. We want to follow Natalie Portman characte's journey to find her own answers to what has happened to her husband that just shows up after being away for a year. Mystery surrounds a military mission into the glimmer. A ecosystem that is created after a meteor crashes into a lighthouse. Portman and a group of women scientist take thier turn into the glimmer to try to find answeres. If you are just getting into cerebral sci-fi films then this semi spoon feed flick is for you. The issues that I have with this film is the flash back cut sceens do not add any substance to the story as a whole. Every step of the way we where literally told what is happening in the shimmer...zero mistery. Until the lighthouse ending that makes this films climax worth the wait. Garland's older films out preform his newest attempt on the big screen."
"341",4,"  ANNIHILATION EST CE GENRE DE FILM RAFRAŒCHISSANT, SURTOUT DANS LE GENRE SCIENCE-FICTION ET QUI PROUVE QU'UNE PRISE DE RISQUE (√Ä L'INSTAR D'UN INTERSTELLAR PAR EXEMPLE) EST G√âN√âRALEMENT PLUS APPR√âCIABLE QUE DE CHERCHER √Ä R√âINVENTER UN CONCEPT D√âJ√Ä VU MAINTES FOIS. UNE BELLE SURPRISE ET UN FILM √Ä VOIR POUR LES AMATEURS DE S-F."
"342",2,"  I haven't read the novel and went into movie with no knowledge of the story. This movie is a knock off of the story line from HP Lovecraft's ""The Colour of Space"". Of course different scenario however the main theme of a meteor from space crashing on earth, creating an ever expanding ""shimmer""....causing plant life, animals and humans to change...sadly knowing the book and how GOOD that is ruined this movie for me...read it, you will see what I mean."
"343",3.5,"  Now that was trippy! Beautifully crafted and imaginative, characters felt a bit week though."
"344",5,"  Excellency in movie form. Great acting, strong female rolls, and an overall execution of the film that leaves paranoia and fear long after you leave the theater"
"345",4.5,"  that bear though <3"
"346",2,"  I suppose I have a different perspective about this movie than many of the fan's around here. While the premise of the movie was great, the fx, the sets, props, and even parts of the story - I had a SUPER hard time with my suspension of reality while watching this movie."
"347",5,"  This is a great movie.....Netflix 1 - Paramount 0"
"348",3.5,"  We get maybe a handful of good Sci-Fi films every year and this was one of them. I really enjoyed Annihilation and it shows that Alex Garland is an up and coming film maker w/serious potential. That said, there are some very real problems with it. The casting is iffy. Natalie Portman, Oscar Issac and Jennifer Jason Leigh are competent in their roles but everyone else feels like a hasty decision with zero depth. Brilliant moments that are slow, long - moody cinematic reflections, resembling something that Terrence Malick would do are eclipsed by soapy dramatic encounters and cheesy creature effects. It was definitely worth watching but it's already off my radar as a seriously good Sci-Fi movie."
"349",4,"  Focused direction, smart screenplay, great ensemble (led by a powerful performance by Natalie Portman), and dazzling production design and visual effects."
"350",2,"  Overrated, pretentious horror movie masked as sci-fi"
"351",3.5,"  Cool sci-fi movie. Really strange. Presently reading online reviews to get an understanding of ""what it all means"""
"352",3,"  When I saw that the film would come on Netflix I really wanted to see it, but I had to wait about a week so my expectations were a bit to high."
"353",1,"  Although my wife enjoyed this movie; I think it missed the boat some what. There are too many perpetual ideas you can attach to it, but at the end of the day it just didn't have great plot depth like Ex Machina."
"354",4.5,"  Gone are the days when alien movies were all about UFO's and aliens wreaking havoc on mankind to conquer earth. After Arrival this is another movie which deals with Alien, Sci-fi topic with intellect. It doesn't blatantly shows the alien to be bad and trying to wipe out a species, but instead it shows in a more scientific way how the alien reacts to the new environment , Earth it is and is dealing with it. The cinematography is awesome and the whole movie is beautiful frame by frame. The story line and the subtle foreshadowing is magnificent. And the background music although a bit techno and futuristic fits in the movie perfectly. A must watch for sci-fi aficionados."
"355",0.5,"  Such a shame a really good and original book is transposed (butchered?) in such a bad cheesy sci-fi movie. Not worth the time."
"356",5,"  IMHO..even though this story inter weaves lots of motifs from other movies and books, the end result is still thoughtful and rewarding. Nice pacing, structure, plot and acting from Natalie Portman and the support cast. Definately not for fans of 'The Last Jedi'...this movie eft me with a nice smile on my face, and something to talk about over coffee. Bravo!"
"357",4,"  They talk too much. And that's a good thing. A new vision on sci-fi themes, a new mature and philosophical way to talk about aliens, horror and unknown. A modern 'Alien', in a certain way.Good performance from Oscar Isaac who, even if he doesn't appear so much in the movie, has left inside of me a bitter sense of depression."
"358",5,"  Moody, thinking, awesomeness..."
"359",5,"  Beautiful, complex, captivating and terrifying with moments of stillness all at once. I wonder Producers of this film who completely lost faith, what exactly is it that you thought audiences 'wouldn't get'? Oh how you don't know us AT ALL. Thank god Netflix does..."
"360",0.5,"  That movie promise more than really is I don't like it"
"361",5,"  Just saw this on Netflix and an outstanding movie, truly one of the strangest (if not the strangest) Sci-fi Horror movies I have ever seen. I get the impression that this would be the type of screenplay book adaptation that one would make if one were high on something, LOL. It is weird, but in a beautiful way, and it does bring something new to the scifi genre. Natalie Portman did a great job in carrying the movie, she was very effective in that role. Anyway, great scifi horror, very innovative. Watch out for that Bear scene, it was one of things that really made this movie unique."
"362",5,"  5 Star Sci-Fi. This film is a great mystery Sci-Fi which remains refreshingly vague. This probably isn't for everyone, and it has a feeling very similar to A Space Odyssey 2001."
"363",2,"  I was disappointed while watching Annihilation in the theater last night. My friend watching with me apologized for suggesting it, as she was unhappy as well. With 24 hours of thinking about it, still disappointed. The film meanders, yet doesn't hit enough points to make the degradation of the team apparent. This interfered with my suspension of disbelief, along with the supposed seriousness of the situation. 3 years of missing exploratory teams? No communication once inside? One would suspect the Southern Reach project was run by bottom feeders. I could see the movie compared to 2001 and Apocalypse Now, but the descent to madness isn't plotted out, and the transcendence of the final act isn't impactful. It doesn't work. Ex Machina worked, but I won't spend any more time on this failure."
"364",3,"  Bit slow, script with a seemingly profound theory but a muddled conclusion, nice VFX."
"365",3.5,"  It was good, but definitely not as good as I was hoping..overall it was worth seeing, but some parts are pretty bad."
"366",5,"  Great abstract movie by the director of Ex-Machina, do it justice and don't watch it on your laptop. Wonderful visual imagery."
"367",4.5,"  This is one of the most weird and crazy movies that you ever see in these past years, Annihilation is another great acomplishment by the director Alex Garland. He delivers suspense, dazzing visual, an intriguing narrative and compelling moments with a solid leading cast (Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez and Tuva Novotny are great) that involves the public from the beginning to the end. (4,5/5)"
"368",5,"  Absolutely incredible. Loved all of it, shame it was only on Netflix."
"369",0.5,"  blah... bunch of girls try to be macho.. seriously ?....fail"
"370",4.5,"  A visually stunning film that initially leaves you utterly confused. This movie tackles various ""self-destructive"" tendencies of human nature and a person's will and effort in trying to change those tendencies. Alex Garland delivers another great flick to the Sci-Fi genre. He effectively immerses us in an intriguing universe, that messes with our psyche. There have been many comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this movie has a much more concrete plot and thought out characters. I thought this movie started off very strong and ended on a comparatively okay note. Annihilation constantly kept my mind churning, while also keeping me guessing on what would happen next."
"371",3.5,"  Not only are many of the moments in Annihilation completely memorable, but many of the themes and ideas presented within have plenty of artistic and intellectual value that cannot go ignored, but sadly, the film as a whole is nowhere near as perfect as many of its small moments, more often than not exhibiting questionable desicions of rythm and directing, as well as a general feeling that the whole concept of the film is not as smart as it is actually underdeveloped."
"372",2,"  Funny looking at the females walking toward the wilderness, kind of ghost busters. The movie is like a peyote trip completely out of reality."
"373",3.5,"  An ambiguous and mysterious film that deserves your attention with its interesting premise."
"374",4.5,"  There are very few awesome Scifi Horror movies. Very few. I only had one beef with the movie. It was a typical Smart/Dumb scientist trope. It is such a minor flaw. Forgivable. It's like smelling a fart during an opera. It's inevitable, short, and goes away. More importantly, it doesn't take away from the experience."
"375",1,"  This film was okay until the absurd ending in the final segment called the Lighthouse involving a crazy alien twin. Ugh. I didn't find it thought provoking at all."
"376",5,"  Loved it. Cracking visuals and great acting. The soundtrack is good too. Different and thought provoking."
"377",5,"  Brilliant quality through out really refreshing watch. Highly recommended this to any sci-fi/thriller lover."
"378",4,"  Excellent intelligent old-school sci-fi."
"379",3.5,"  ANNIHILATION. I can see why this film would have mixed reviews. It is somewhat dark, somber, bleak, even disturbing and upsetting. Yet, it also was really interesting and well done. It certainly kept my attention. It is not your typical Hollywood feel-good film. If you like a different kind of sci-fi, like Prometheus, you may enjoy this. I dug the musical score too."
"380",1,"  A movie about watching psychedelic paint dry"
"381",1,"  Ooooh no no no. Whilst this film has been praised for lofty themes and an all female lead cast playing scientists - admirable and appealing traits - the writer, director and special effects artists are in well over their heads. Bring back the likes of Cronenberg and Lynch!"
"382",4,"  Visually awesome; different to to novel but still a great sci-fi."
"383",2,"  I think I would have appreciated the film a lot more if I had not read the book. Natalie Portman is really good and the story line is definitely interesting. It just didn't follow the storyline of the book whatsoever and that made me really disappointed. It's a good book so I do not see a reason to change it so completely."
"384",3,"  While this Sci-Fi-Adventure comes with a pretty impressive cast, great looking effects and an interesting premise, the last act does not entirely live up to the set-up. You can't say the film doesn't try to bring something new to the table but the slow pace and philosophical aspects of the rather biological problems shown only work to some degree. The ending is as unsettling as weird. You gotta appreciate the film going different ways, and it's certainly as entertaining as challenging, but somehow I expected a little...more."
"385",4,"  Thought provoking, disturbing, and altogether great sci-fi film. Where are all the women in Hollywood praising the all female lead cast? Maybe there weren't enough terrible jokes in it. This movie doesn't treat its audience like idiots which is probably why no one went to see it."
"386",3,"  The thought process behind the movie carries so much depth that it almost pierces the mind and hangs on like a bloody nightmare. The movie is World apart from other scifi thrill and is terrifyingly thought provoking. However it seems that the ending could have been better or more explicable."
"387",3,"  The story needs work, however good effects."
"388",4.5,"  toller film, echt bizarr das er in deutschland direkt bei Netflix gelandet ist und nicht ins kino kommt."
"389",2,"  Aside from the really cool special effects, this movie was complete garbage. Other than Portman the acting was poor and the story was very weak. I'm wondering how this was certified fresh. Ex machina was excellent. Watch that again and skip this"
"390",3,"  I wasn't too interested on first sight. Had nothing to do so I decided to finish this one. It's an interesting story though. I had this ""Last Of Us""(Video Game) vibe until the last couple of scenes. This post-apocalypse feel almost. The atmosphere (Music, sounds) also had me thinking about ""The Last Of Us"" I really liked that. The movie has the viewers questioning a lot of things about life, be it science, religion or just the meaning of life. The surroundings in this movie are very pleasing to the eyes. CG-Wise it was alright, they did a very good job although there were some bits where it could have been much better. The movie did have a few plot-twists, the move ended in an open-ending, left me hanging with a lot of questions, things I still NEEDED to see. They decided to go for a full female-cast (lead roles), characters were diverse had a little backstory to them, we didn't really go too deep, so I don't believe the viewers will care much about them (Everyone excluding Natalie Portman). I like the sci-fi visuals and the interesting mix of the ""post-apocalyptic"" genre. Overall, an alright movie. Recommended to light sci-fi lovers and people who love the ""zombie-esque"" type of movies."
"391",5,"  Solaris + Stalker = Annihilation."
"392",3.5,"  3.5/5 StarsI can see this as a movie you either love or hate. It is a cross between sci-fi and a thriller. It flips back and forth between three different times as it reveals the story to you. And by the end of the movie it feels a bit like 2001 with the ""what the hell is happening here?""Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh gave pretty solid performances. The rest of the crew was meh. The plot kept my interest through and kept me on edge. I'm still not sure what to think of the entire end of he movie. But overall I enjoyed it"
"393",4,"  Tense. Intense. Weird. Good."
"394",5,"  Unique, a really unique Sci-fi movie, the last 15 mins worth EVERYTHING"
"395",4,"  Something different, I've found it interesting and disturbing at the same time"
"396",2,"  Wow. Netflix has officially become the Buzzfeed of the film world.The lazy attempt to jump on the ""Empowering women in the film industry"" bandwagon is about as flimsy as the plot.So...the plot.The movie opens on Natalie Portman patronising (they'd call this ""mansplaining"" if she had a penis) a class of university medical students, by explaining what a cell is. It then cuts almost immediately to Nat at home crying over her lost husband, as a soppy emotional song plays. We've never met this guy, therefore we don't care who is or what happened to him, and all we know of Nat at this point is that she's patronising and anti-social. Yet for some reason, [insert director / writer names here] seem to think we give a damn. No. We don't. Also, ever hear of the power of silence? It would have been much stronger, emphasising the emptiness of her life. I don't know anything about making movies, but I know that two minutes into a movie that has told us nothing about the characters, I don't give a damn about the characters. This is all a part of the ""sensitive feelings"" bandwagon that needy film makers have been blindly jumping onto lately.Ok. Zombie husband comes home and they both get taken to the base on the border of soap bubble land, at EXACTLY the same point in time that the govt is about to send an ethnically-diverse, all women-squad with zero training (two of the three can't even work out north from south) into the bubble land wilderness to survive alone, Bear Grylls style.They head off into soap bubble land laden with equipment but without the ONLY thing the govt knows (because of zombie husband who Nat herself said looks like a victim of radiation or chemicals) will be effective - biohazard suits and oxygen masks.It also just so happens that Nat has EXACTLY the right qualifications to slot into the Ghostbusterettes team as clueless and utterly untrained team member 5. So, double coincidence / s**tty lazy storyline.Also we have a quick sex scene in which Nat of course is on top.We also see a flashback to a room in which she's getting bluntly interrogated by a man (because men are evil and without feelings).They shoot a crocodile, thankfully without crossing the beams and...annihilating everything.Then they find a video recorder with a film (that has been spliced and edited within the recorder) which extremely clearly shows a man with a slimy creature sliding around in his stomach for over ten seconds, yet one of the ghostbusterettes (plainly not the Bill Murray one who has some sense of reality) laughably, dismisses it as a trick of the light.Nat has a flashback to good times with her husband, to a song that that blatantly rips off The Last of Us soundtrack.Some other stuff happens. It all looks a lot like The Last of Us. I think they go crazy or something and start seeing trippy 90s-style graphics. Someone runs through a cave like a moron and we see lots of Nat looking concerned. There's a room with a guy who forgot to take off his green-screen suit. I zoned out at some point in the second half so not really sure what happens really. There are some cells and fires and it all gets vague and surreal like so many of these films now.So.I'm all for equality. But not when it's being appropriated without sense or logic and being used for no other reason than [insert director / writer names here] want to jump onto the latest social movement bandwagon like zombie lemmings because they're spineless and desperate for praise.Also, there's a trend for movies to be vague and open-ended, especially art-house films. The makers seem to think this is arty. No. It's f**ing lazy and shows you don't give a damn about your audience.This movie will probably do really well because social media is conning people into thinking garbage is good for them. But thankfully, history will be much less kind to nonsense like this."
"397",5,"  A movie you will only fully understand if you'e aware of the Jungian psychological framework and themes at play (such as ego, the shadow self, archetypes, collective unconscious etc). This is a fascinating visual trip into the unconscious mind. Unfortunately, some reviewers are unaware of the symbolism being used and are unable to interpret the film correctly which leads to them thinking the film ''doesn't make sense'' - the fear this film was 'too intellectual' for cinema release worldwide was clearly a valid concern. A brief introduction to Carl Jung's Depth Psychology will set you up to enjoy this masterpiece."
"398",5,"  A MASTERPIECE ! LOVED IT !"
"399",0.5,"  Yet another movie about girls with guns. Do they need to be men? No thanks. Walked out."
"400",4,"  pretty jungian and explorative in a way that seems aimless at first but actually comes together in what it's saying about human destruction of our surroundings and our self-destruction surprisingly. the nightmarish imagery is super effective. and that score.... so good."
"401",0.5,"  Another movie that plods along to nowhere. Bad story, bad execution extremely dull."
"402",5,"  Don't usually give 5 stars unless it's a classic or I love it but this movie is awesome. Everything was great, from the directing to the acting to the writing and screenplay. Fantastic!"
"403",2.5,"  Strange movie. Not too bad, but confusing and kind of boring"
"404",1,"  I guess the movie is smarter than me."
"405",4,"  A VERY GOOD SCI-FI FLICK THAT WILL KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED THROUGHOUT. THE ACTING IS ABOVE PAR LED BY PORTMAN. HER CO-STARS DO AN EXCELLENT JOB OF ROUNDING OUT THE CAST. THE MOVIE LEAVES SOME QUESTIONS UNANSWERED SO BE PREPARED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS ONE AFTER IT'S DONE. OVERALL A VERY INTERESTING AND CAPTIVATING SCI-FI FILM."
"406",5,"  Honestly, it scared the crap out of me. It was weird enough and had that intangible ""something"" that had me still thinking about it days later. It's weird because it is a true sci fi and it is about what would happen if a complete (tiny spoiler - don't read the next five words if you don't want a hint................ alien ""something"" fooled with our DNA,............ because that is what the unknown something probably does naturally.

Ex Machina , by the same film maker, also gave me a real creepy scare. It was also a sci fi, addressing deep subjects with what could be and what would that mean, and what does it mean to be human. I'm not surprised both films were by the same director. He really has a certain flair going on in his films, and I think they are both very well done and very unique and thought provoking for those who are willing to think, and they both scared me more than a monster movie would have."
"407",4.5,"  Finally really good sci-fi movie which i have not seen for a very long time."
"408",2,"  Could of been good but got real messed up along the way. I hate movies that leave the end WAY opening"
"409",5,"  Adorei o filme. Principalmente uma metafora final com alus„o a uma compreens√£o social que a criatura absorve da personagem principal. Fazendo com que ela se volte contra si mesma. // I loved the movie. Mainly a final metaphor alluding to a social understanding that the creature absorbs from the main character. Making her turn against herself."
"410",4,"  Beautiful, yet TERRIFYING"
"411",3,"  This movie incorporated a lot of interesting science fiction ideas. I tend to like movies that explore metaphysical and psychological questions, as this one does with ambition. In fact, it is a little too ambitious with the clever ideas and doesn't quite wrap things together at the end to my satisfaction, but it was still fun to watch and then debate in the car on way home. The complete lack of realistic planning by the characters or alleged ""organization"" investigating the mysterious shimmer was a big flaw. Strong performances and beautiful cinematography."
"412",5,"  The film ""The shape of water"" brings a romantic talento that goes on in the 60's for me one of the best times to get the story a perfect performance of Sally Hawkins, i saw love for the creature in his eyes a beautiful feeling. With a breathtaking ending that brings peace to the heart. This movie was Oscar winner"
"413",2,"  The trailer is better than the movie, that's for sure. I've said it before so many times that it's become redundant- the critics are an enigma to say the least. I really don't know why this film has gotten such high marks from them because it pretty much leaves you scratching your head at the end. Maybe that's what they look for in these films. But for us average low brow movie goers it's really not that great. Sure wish I had the high IQ that is required to appreciate this film. The critics consensus says ""Annihilation backs up its sci-fi visual wonders and visceral genre thrills with an impressively ambitious -- and surprisingly strange -- exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll."" Where do they come up with this stuff?? Do they even know what they said? Did they really even watch the movie? I have to wonder. 2 stars, only because it kept me interested to see the outcome, which was a disappointment and could have been better."
"414",5,"  A really weird, fun movie, and deserves to be seen by many more people."
"415",4,"  I want to start saying that it's amazing how putting female characters makes a movie refreshingly new. This says a lot about our society. But what about the movie? I am not sure. Definitely interesting. Quiet moments mixed with some horror. It kept me wondering what the hell was going on until the end. And then the end came and..... I won't tell how it ends clearly. But to resume the movie with a word: trippy."
"416",5,"  Maybe that's the best sci-fi movie..."
"417",0.5,"  Plot holes everywhere. Unrealistic reactions. Incredibly stupid romantic are discovered to be the engine of the characters. The beautiful Natalie Portman and the thrilling sensations are far from balacing this terrible movie."
"418",4,"  Really enjoyed this one"
"419",1,"  Futile and banal. Numerous leaps of disbelievable faith lead nowhere. I suppose it's all explained in the blase meaningless finale..where we learn that it's all for naught. pitiful effort."
"420",1.5,"  Tedioso. O filme promete e n„o entrega. Parece mais uma jornada pelo incompreens√≠vel que n√£o culmina numa epifania ou uma simples explica√ß√£o do que UMa explora√ß√£o no estilo ""O segredo do abismo"". Parece mais com ""2001"". Existencial e intelectual√≥ide do tipo que um amigo chato se apaixona para dizer que entendeu apenas para ser diferent√£o."
"421",4.5,"  a visceral experience! Alex garland keeps proving he is one of the most talented sci-fi directors around.you won¬¥t know what hit you"
"422",5,"  a GREAT SCI-FI MOVIE THAT IS TRUE TO ITS ROOTS (imo, 80'S sCI-FI). vERY UNDERRATED."
"423",1,"  Horribly boring. Let's send in the worst of the worst and see what happens. Yawn."
"424",5,"  It's really refreshing seeing such thought provoking, original, Interesting and beautiful Sci fi movies contrasting the generic pulp THAT's being MASs-produced nowadays. Excellent WORk and a great cinematic experience."
"425",2.5,"  Annihilation is yet another example of a Hollywood wannabe who takes source material, throws it in a blender, adds ingredients from outside the realm of the story, pours half the concoction on the floor, adds more foreign substance and then blends until the story is so liquefied it is unrecognizable from it's beginnings. Go into a dimly lit room, bring the novel Annihilation from Jeff VanderMeer with you, and read a better story than what this mess presents."
"426",4,"  Directed by Alex Garland, Annihilation is a dark sci-fi with a lot of thought provoking moments and disturbing imagery. An unknown presence has appeared, known as a shimmer, many military groups have gone in but none have come out and the area it covers is slowly expanding. When a survivor manages to escape a new group decides to head into the shimmer and discover what is at its root. It's hard to talk about Annihilation without spoiling key plot points and impactful moments so I won't linger on the premise but the whole idea of the shimmer and what we learn within it is extremely thought provoking, unique and great to sink your teeth into and discuss at length.The cast as whole is very solid and Natalie Portman is excellent as Lena, a biologist with prior military experience who is determined to go into the shimmer. Portman is able to portray a strong stoic character whilst maintaining some vulnerability and charisma. Tessa Thompson and Gina Rodriguez also stand out from the crowd of adventurers as Josie and Anya but aren't given much character development so they can be a little one note.The best thing about this film are its visuals. The locations and sets used for filming are excellent and transform you to this dreamlike but also nightmarish version or earth that also surveys to convey a fair bit about the plot. The use of models and puppets in conjunction with good CGI also serves to deliver some very disturbing and unnerving imagery that will stick with you after watching the film.The soundtrack is also appropriately sci-fi with a strangely nauseating sound that reflects the uncomfortable and unpleasant events that unfold and how the characters begin to feel more and more unnerved.There is a subplot that I don't think added much to the plot and the film as a whole but it's not long or too involved so it doesn't detract much from the main narrative. There is also a moment when the title of the film is used which felt very corny to me and should have been left out.Overall, this is one of the best sci-fis I've seen in the last few years and by far one of the most original. After Ex-Machina Alex Garland has proved himself as an excellent sci-fi director and writer and I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future."
"427",5,"  First film in a long time I've watched two times back to back..."
"428",2,"  Annihilation had so much potential, but it left me as the lead character said ""I don't know"". I don't get it. It was interesting, until the end as it left me... speakless. I don't know what I watched. The acting, effects, and story were good until the end."
"429",1,"  Extremely dissapointed with this movie. everything is given away in the trailers, save for one awkward and easy to see twist. I forced a couple friends to watch this movie with me, and we all had the same experience. save your money and watch it on dvd."
"430",5,"  Annihilation (2018) is a perfect work of science fiction and one of my favorite movies of the last decade. The acting, effects, and story are all top notch. There are many familiar elements and tropes, but it exceeds its precursors while adding something new. A gorgeous movie! A+"
"431",0.5,"  Actual garbage of a movie, do not give in to the hype."
"432",4,"  'Annihilation' is a science fiction masterpiece that works as a perfect amalgamation of experimental storytelling, visual extravaganza, strong performances and intelligent direction."
"433",4,"  Departs significantly from the book. As a film, Annihilation is good but perhaps too derivative. As a film based on a book, it was disappointing. But it's worth watching for the score and visual effects."
"434",4.5,"  Every single shot was just incredible to experience. The story was super interesting with an alright twist at the end. one of the reasons i love this for that fact that it doesn't shy away from gore and in this movie... there is quite a lot."
"435",5,"  amazing, surreal, loyal to the themes and feeling of the source and unique at the same time. truly masterful ending, though a little cliche at the last minute. really enjoyable performances, sound and aesthetic."
"436",4,"  jUST WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OFTEn."
"437",0.5,"  If you watched first 20 min of this movie you seen allIt is garbage of a movie completely wasted my timeHopefully im saving yours"
"438",2,"  Es muy mala, como el libro, a pesar de los cambios tan grandes que introdujeron en la adaptaciÛn. Es una l√°stima porque la idea de fondo en el libro me parece muy buena, pero el desarrollo de la historia y los personajes son p√©simos. Aburrida, sin sentido, incoherente."
"439",5,"  A great original sci fi movie."
"440",3.5,"  Annihilation has a clever way to MASQUERADE ambiguity with REVELATION. It offers nothing new, no food for thought or any premise to elaborate on. However, the cast is good enough to make it going. Another plus point would be all of the colors of the spectrum you could think of. Then again, that is nothing we havent seen before as well."
"441",4,"  Loved the movie... It's strange, but the book was as well. Really positively surprised... hope they go on with the sequels!"
"442",5,"  ""stalker"", ""SoLaris"" and Vandemeer in a Lovely mix... Alex Garland second Sci-Fi Movie is almost as good as his debut Ex Machina..Almost certainly not in everyone's taste but i loved it."
"443",3,"  At this point I'm not really sure how to feel about ""Annihilation"". As far as sci-fi movies go, I feel that this movie has all the potential of being a success. it introduces some really interesting ideas, and throughout the movie there is a thirst for answers that keeps driving you forward. the entire cast did a fantastic job and i want to CONGRATULATE the idea of having an entirely female main cast. The visuals are so really good and the action scenes as well. There is a horror element throughout the movie and some twists that really got me unawares. my only real issue was with the ending. ""Annihilation"" is a movie that requires discussion afterwards and I sure am here for that, because I feel like different people will have different opinions about this movie. It is artistic sci-fi and I'm sure we need more of these."
"444",4,"  Refraction and annihilation"
"445",0.5,"  This movie had some potential. It was a lot like contact where the end just sucked the sweat off dead mens ballocks. It was not well acted and only kept you going because it was a train wreck. Save your money. Portman is not a likeable character."
"446",5,"  BLows the book away! Amazing adaptation!"
"447",4.5,"  Love this film! interesting. Intelligent. Exciting. Beautiful fx. One of the best last 20 mins of cinema I've seen since mother!"
"448",0.5,"  On Earth, no one can hear you snore."
"449",3,"  Some GOOd parts, good premise... but overall a bit boring."
"450",2,"  did it communicate with you..AnnihilationThe far fetched idea is not only visible miles away before its station but even the priorities seem to fade off quite early before the scrutiny even begins. A smart adaptation with strict editing on writing section by Alex Garland is possibly the only reason why someone might survive this feature. But unfortunately as much as to-the-point and gripping the screenplay is, the execution lacks better editing as it chews on this slow pill for almost an extra half an hour (the runtime could have easily been of 90 minutes). Natalie Portman is devastatingly good and there is no flinching on that and on her supporting side Oscar Issac justifies its presence on the screen. Even though the genre depicts horror; which is on a head-scratching level (the ""help me"" cries will be enough for your nightmares) where even the elders might cringe on the seat, there are some genuinely good visuals that brightens the tone a bit. Annihilation is without a doubt no short on execution (Alex Garland hits perfect mark on executing the paper on screen) then whether it is to project a heart breaking action sequences or horror chills or even creative creatures but what it fails is on offering a newer perspective, better plotline and a good old tale."
"451",0.5,"  the story line isn't bad, but the acting is. Jennifer jason leigh reminded me of a bratty teenager at sometimes, and a catatonic mute at others."
"452",4.5,"  lEFT ME PRETTY MUCH BREATHLESS."
"453",5,"  Alex Garland's follow-up to 2015's fantastic 'Ex Machina' is a fascinating film, even before you sit down and watch it. Firstly, it has had a less than conventional journey to our screens - under the weight of a big budget, and underwhelming test audience reviews, Paramount decided to cut their losses and sell it to Netflix for a fee that doesn't even cover half of it's costs, so sure were they of it proving a box-office bomb. Secondly, Garland refused to bow to pressure and make radical changes to his film, to compromise his vision, in order to ensure studio support. His decision was ultimately entirely justified.Based on the apparently 'unfilmable' Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation focuses on a five-strong, all-female, expedition that sets out to investigate a mysterious 'shimmer' that has appeared, killing everyone who has dared enter it, which threatens to expand rapidly and envelop the planet. Each member of the crew, offers a profession or speciality, that they hope can unravel the mystery, and indeed unravelling takes place, but not of the intended kind - Natalie Portman leads the cast, in a performance as good as any in her back catalogue, which is a low-bar I will admit, but this is easily up to her 'Black Swan' best. There is equally fine support from her cast-mates, including a wonderfully understated showing from Jennifer Jason Leigh.Where the film is a success, is in taking a well established horror formula of having a group of players, picked off one by one by a malevolent force, and using it not as the focus but as a means to an end. The set-pieces are understated and infrequent, though brutal, but necessary to understanding the bigger picture. It is refreshing too, to have a group of characters reacting intelligently to the events surrounding them, and too for a film to have a group of women at it's centre. A rarity for a movie of this type. Yet gender is never referred to throughout. It is not used as a plot device or indeed intended to be some kind of feminist message. Technically, the film is a marvel. Garland has created a vision that is both of this earth, and yet other-worldly at the same time. With natural elements given mutated optics to create a location that plays into the unease felt by the characters the deeper they venture into it. The final sequence, that runs for a good 20 minutes, devoid of dialogue, is as 'out there' as anything I have seen in a studio picture for quite some time. The accompanying soundtrack by Portishead instrumentalist Geoff Barrow, is something else here, complementing a scene that will serve as nightmare-fuel for this viewer for some time to come, not because of any gore or indeed scare, but for the sense of anxiety it creates.You can understand why Paramount bailed on the project, especially after the chance they took with last year's 'mother!' which proved to be box-office poison for them, but their loss is ultimately Netflix's gain. A fine addition to their catalogue and easily one of the best films I have seen this year."
"454",3.5,"  An acidic bubble taste perfumes the atmosphere in this piece which hues the mind into its world of surreal christening and abstract subjective/dream like wonder. See it and enjoy your thoughts for the rest of the afternoon, you'll be thinking about it"
"455",2.5,"  The movie is a little pretentious, but overall is pretty decent. It shares several elements with STALKER. It's well directed, doesn't have lots of pace problems (but theres a huge difference from mid to end), and the visuals/setting are nice, leaving a small impression of something alien, but it's pretty recognizable as a terran woodland.The movie mixes real science with the si-fi, but the end result is a little shallow. The open end just adds pretentiousness. The CGI is pretty bad.Natalie Portman was excellent, but the rest of the cast was a little uneven. And even though the cast is pretty diverse, the best part is that there's ZERO white male representation."
"456",4,"  It doesn't deliver the same artistic impact as Ex Machina did, but Alex Garland's adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer's novel is a unique take at thought-provoking-sci fi's, considering how hollow they seem nowadays, but Annihilation reaches several contexts needed to dig down into the film's purposes, and its several ideas seems to be on schedule behind Portman's character, as well as the rest of its cast members, delivering a beautifully looking and thrilling flick that serves for several viewings."
"457",3.5,"  Visually beautiful and original but a little unsatisfied with the story."
"458",4.5,"  Excellent movie about an original concept."
"459",5,"  A delightful blend of Alien, Arrival, and Under the Skin, Annihilation triumphs thanks to the strength of its cerebral science, creative creepiness, and audacious ambiguity."
"460",0.5,"  All the single ladies... Slow, and when i say slow i mean snail fight is more dynamic. with other words: another deeply unsuccessful feminist attempt for a movie (yeah, yeah the books...). But, hey - this one was in a soap bubble, very creative! Keep 'em coming!"
"461",4.5,"  Annihilation is a refreshing cerebral sci fi ride with great visuals, cinematography and performances all around."
"462",5,"  great movie, very imaginative , fun science fiction"
"463",2,"  ""I dont know""  says it all"
"464",5,"  A must see MOvie that never let's up on the suspense. You never know what to expect and overall provides a pleasing storyline and vivid graphics. A movie truly thought out and very well put together with great actors and a jaw dropping ending."
"465",4,"  felt like a great spiritual SUCCESSOR to THe thing but the end faltered a little bit."
"466",5,"  Adorei o filme. Natalie portman est· muito bem, o filme tem a mesma pegada de achegada. √© tenso, prende a aten√ß√£o e √© nada √≥bvio. √© um bel√≠ssimo trabalho dispon√≠vel no seu netflix mais pr√≥ximo... s√≥ n√£o assista no celular, ok? esse filme merece uma tela maior."
"467",1,"  not even mildly entertaining. this wouldn't even be good for the syfy channel and doesn't even compare to any single episode of black mirror. i was actually shocked by how atrocious annihilation was because ex machina was one of my top 25 favorite movies of all time."
"468",2,"  AVERAGE SCI-FI B MOVIE. WHY GO THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO GET TO THE LIGHTHOUSE WHEN THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN THE BEACH ROUTE?? iF NOTHING HAS RETURNED FROM THE SHIMMER, WHY NOT ENTER A SHORT WAY, THEN RETURN TO SEE IF IT'S POSSIBLE? hAVING SAID THAT, EVEN BAD SCI-FI IS BETTER THAN NO SCI-FI."
"469",4,"  Netflix have really stepped up their film output in recent months, and this was another step in the right direction. Love Natalie Portman's films usually and this one didn't disappoint. Made you follow the plot and use your brain a bit, which is never a bad thing."
"470",4,"  A Visually stunning mind bending EXPERIENCE."
"471",1,"  I thought the movie looked awful from the trailer, but was convinced to see it by a friend. I regret the money and time I spent seeing this one. I thought it was awful and boring as Hell. It was disappointing, as good as Ex Machina was, this was bad."
"472",4.5,"  I liked it where some wont due to being a bit of a brain tingler , the ending is a make your own perception of the Film . Its a slow burner but it sucks you in ans wanting to know more and more . Straight to neTflix was a Surprise for me in the uK."
"473",4.5,"  Really enjoyed the movie, thought the director made a few weird choices (the framing device and parts of the score). However, this is the movie that people should be seeing right now. Also, this movie has an all-female cast, yet is hearing nothing about this. this is what ghostbusters (2016) should have been, an under-the-radar flick that you don't even realize has an all female cast until halfway through the movie. Plus, the visual storytelling was great. SPOILERS FROM HEre on out:I was a little annoyed how at every found footage scene, they cut to the reactions of the actresses watching the footage, it ruined the immersion for me. Plus, the guitar interludes (in a major key) in the soundtrack was a weird jump in tone; this movie could have learned a bit from whomever scored arrival. overall though, i enjoyed this movie."
"474",0.5,"  Horribly boring!!! Seriously who rated this high???? piece of crap boring movie - should be negative stars"
"475",5,"  A TRULY CEREBRAL MOVIE. ONE OF THE BEST SINCE INTERSTELLAR. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING ANNIHILATION IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO THINKS DEEPLY AT LIFE."
"476",3.5,"  Not so deep as it could be but enough to make people think. I like the ""dark paradise"" thing: at the same time the Shimmer has some beauty it also has something terrifying. Maybe it illustrates the fear of changes. I'm losing my mind here, it's a interesting movie."
"477",5,"  In very simple words: a Great ride with goosebumps, scares and disturbing scenes we have all been waiting for in a sci-fi flick ... been waiting for a while! it has a ...kinda bodysnatchers (the old one with sutherland & Nimoy) and war of the worlds (the Tom Cruise Version) mix with a little of the Star trek tng episode where geordi turns into an alien , rock like being... eerily good"
"478",3.5,"  February 23, 2018""Annihilation"" is an engaging mix of big ideas, heavy atmosphere and raw tension, but it eventually only yields a moderate payoff. It poses more questions than answers, a strategy that works in its favor because it holds our attention and keeps us guessing, and its visual and audio design are so sharp and penetrating they make the film a thoroughly immersive experience.†But while these qualities certainly make ""Annihilation"" good and absolutely worth seeing, I can't help but think it could have been better. What holds it back from greatness is that it eventually resorts to traditional sci-fi horror devices just when it should have continued to expound its science and ideas. It exchanges these more substantive traits for conventional action and special effects, and while some of its more sensational moments are arguably effective, on the whole, they feel too familiar, and the film, in turn, feels too complacent.Still, that's to say it's without virtues. In fact, for most of its run, ""Annihilation"" is spellbinding, eerie and disturbing, all in good ways. Director Alex Garland, who made an impressive debut with 2014's ""Ex Machina,"" once again shows he's in complete control of his resources and a rising master of mood, pacing, and tightly wound suspense. He wants the audience to be on edge and feel uncomfortable. He and his editor, Barney Pilling, slowly release the film's built-up tension so there's a constant feeling of dread and uneasiness in the air. Just like ""Ex Machina"" did, ""Annihilation"" makes us feel exposed and vulnerable when it comes to things we don't understand. It also argues we should counteract our inclinations to destroy things that can't be explained.Based on the first novel of James VanderMeer's ""Southern Reach Trilogy,"" the film opens with a meteor striking (but not destroying) a lighthouse on an unknown coast. The impact results in the generation of a force field of sorts that starts to slowly expand and consume the land around it. The outside walls of this ""shimmer,"" as it's called, resemble water dripping down a windshield during a carwash mixed with the colors of the Northern Lights. The shimmer is both threatening and beautiful, and it has the authorities baffled. ""There are many theories, but few facts.""Cut to a quiet, quarantined room, where Lena (Natalie Portman), a cellular biologist, is being interrogated by a man in a hazmat suit. Lena has recently returned from the latest expedition to venture into the shimmer in order to gather data about it and attempt to conclude how it affects humans. She's the only survivor from her original team of five and we soon learn, in flashback, this was also the case for Lena's husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac), whose entire army unit stepped into the shimmer but Kane was the only one to step out. He'd been gone a year and, not hearing from him this whole time or knowing where he was sent, Lena presumed him dead. Then one day Kane wanders back home, confused and disoriented, not to mention extremely ill.On their way to the hospital after Kane collapses, he and Lena are captured by security officials and brought to Area X, the government facility set up outside the shimmer. Here, the abrasive and somewhat suspicious Dr. Vintress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a psychologist, asks Lena questions about her husband, hoping to gain some insight into why he survived but his fellow soldiers perished. Lena doesn't have any answers, although she believes she can help treat her husband by going into the shimmer with Vintress and examining its molecular structure.¬†They join a research team that includes the tough and tomboyish Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez), an EMT; the quiet and reserved Radek (Tessa Thompson), a physicist; and the compassionate Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), an anthropologist.¬†We learn these women¬†volunteered for this mission because they consider themselves ""damaged goods"" and are hoping their uncovering the truths about the shimmer will provide some sort of absolution.But the shimmer provides anything but comfort. Soon after they step in, tension and paranoia begin to rise as the group's communication devices suddenly stop working; they all lose their sense of time and place, such as being unable to remember simple things like when they set up camp or what they ate for breakfast; and they encounter disturbing, hybridized forms of plants and animals, the likes of which I'll not reveal because the explanation of such phenomena plays into the film's overall effort to unnerve us. They also come across troubling evidence of what happened to the previous groups. What we see and learn (and don't learn) about the shimmer keeps us fixated on the screen as the women make their way to the lighthouse.The ideas suggested by ""Annihilation"" are so powerful and intriguing that I wish the movie was called something else and instead of clinging to its themes of violence and destruction, it spent more time discussing the group's theories and findings about what was happening to them and the surrounding plant and animal life. What they talk about and speculate is inherently interesting, especially Josie's hypothesis regarding the mixing of human and plant DNA. But the film cuts these moments short in order to make way for a violent, spectacular showdown, which, although it's done well, felt overly familiar and plagiarized from other sci-fi adventures (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" came to mind).¬†Nevertheless, despite its narrative shortcomings, there's a lot to admire about ""Annihilation."" Its tone, atmosphere and pacing engulf us right from the start and never let go. Even though in hindsight we wish the film had continued to challenge us intellectually instead of merely satiating us visually with action and special effects, we're never bored. In fact, this first installment is so memorable and promising that hopefully the studio will adapt VanderMeer's other novels. Maybe by then the filmmakers won't settle on simply dazzling us with spectacle, but really flush out the science and substance of the story, because it's clearly got some."
"479",4.5,"  Annihilation is wonderfully profound and original."
"480",3,"  Interesting film, Garland strikes again"

"482",4,"  Creepy as fuck. Original sci fi film at its best."
"483",2,"  apart from interesting last 20 mins film is mega-stupid. screenplay has swiss cheese-size holes & near zero logic. spoiler alert: one grenade did the job"
"484",4.5,"  Annihilation - Review (2018)The GoodNatalie Portman is Phenomenal, she is fantastic in quieter, more typical emotive scenes. Alex Garland's Fantastic Direction and his Smart, Thought-Provoking Script, in a lot of ways this is what Prometheus and Alien Covenant should of been:√Ç¬†a tense, character-driven sci-fi thriller that prods and pokes at the nature of creation in a wildly unexpected way.The Fantastic Supporting Cast - Tuva Novotny, Gina Rodriguez and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the more fleshed-out members of Lena's unit, while Tessa Thompson's rather forgettable physicist character conversely feels disappointing underdeveloped.Rodriguez is awesome as the hot head Anya and Leigh brings every bit of skill to the table you'd reasonably expect.Oscar Isaac isn't in it much but hhe makes scenes matterEven knowing the certain fates of certain characters its still very suspenseful, the action is great enought to make you forget that person will die or not. The disturbing effects of what the Shimmer does to the human body.The Visual Effects are breathe taking and the best so far of the year. Its a fantastic Slow burn with a great Atmosphere Rob Hardy fantastic cinematography Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow fantastic Musical Score The totally insane 3rc act with a fantastic ending The BadThere's a side plot with Portman's Character and a professor that is understandable of why its in the film, but it didn't really need to be.Overall: This is one of the smartest and original Sci-fi films to come out in awhile, that deserves more love.Overall Grade: A"
"485",3,"  I can't pretend I understood this film until I read an explanation afterwards!. It had a lot of promise that I don't feel it lived up to - but at the same time, I didn't dislike it. Probably one to rewatch to make sure I 'get' it!"
"486",3,"  Not bad, but not great either. i actually was expecting it to be just ok and i was right. I just hoped id be pleasantly surprised but was not. the monster we see is kinda phony which ruined it a bit for me. but overall, still not BAD, but as I said, not great either. If youre on the fence like i was, its just ok. Save your money for the netflix and go watch something else. P.S. I like natalie portman, that's why i gave it a chance."
"487",2,"  Not writing reviews until this all Caps issue is fixed by RT."
"488",5,"  complete masterpiece! mindblowing!"
"489",4.5,"  (94/100)Wow Alex Garland is a legend. This movie really messed with your mind and I liked it! Finding out what all this is about along the way is a very pleasent experience and I was shocked by the events that occurred."
"490",5,"  Un film capace di trasportare la vostra immaginazione su un livello nuovo e inesplorato. un viaggio nell'inesplorato."
"491",4,"  This movie will make remember the old good movies where you keep thinking and Speculating where it will take you .. what will happen next .. and you will never MANAGE to guess right.Absolutely beautiful and brutal movie.."
"492",5,"  Very good. Well worth a watch. Sci-fi at its best."
"493",5,"  Annihilation is a genre busting story. the path and life of natalie portman's character is riveting. The visuals are striking and disturbing in a very human way. this movie will be talked about for many years. great movie making from one the best directors of our time."
"494",2,"  THE OVERABUNDANCE OF THEMES FEELS OVERWHELMING AND NATALIE PORTMAN'S LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE DOES NOT HELP TO TONE IT DOWN"
"495",4.5,"  A unique and impactful sci-fi experience that is visually stunning. The open ending is what makes this a film that sticks with you and ponder it's many questions."
"496",3.5,"  It appears she joined the realm which her returning husband belongs"
"497",2,"  pretty weird movie but more of drama and less sci-fi"
"498",4.5,"  this is one of the better movies i've seen - SF or otherwise. Really more of a dark psychological art-house thriller than pure SF, annihilation is CONSTANTLY fascinating, slowly revealing the both the plot and the character's psychological background. There's enough ambiguity to make you think, without there being a false cliff hanger. It asks some big questions (is deteriation - BIOLOGICAL, psychological) merely part of life of life itself merging the hard and human sciences WITHOUT being DIDACTIC . I hope they make the sequels"
"499",5,"  Best movie of the Year ??!!"
"500",4.5,"  Very Interesting take on how Depression and PTSD effect the mind and body. involving and sometimes horrifying. Need to see it again."
"501",4.5,"  awesome, change of pace from typical sci fi crap"
"502",3,"  180312 Could've done better"
"503",5,"  Amazing all the way through! Keeps you engaged the entire movie. I went into it expecting it to be good but it was exceptional! there is a deep meaning to the end that is not so obvious. Pay attention!"
"504",3.5,"  A very solid sci-fi film that'll have you questioning your own intelligence and that of the filmmakers. The ending took a while to sink in but it's only grown on me as the days pass by!"
"505",4.5,"  A must-see if you like good sci-fi. Go in blind if you can - no trailers, no reviews. Avoid it you are particularly squeamish though - some scenes had me on the edge of my seat and I will probably not sleep well tonight ;) And it just came out on Netflix!"
"506",0.5,"  Audio/Music 8/10 Cinematography 7/10EVERYTHING else 1/10what a crock."
"507",5,"  exceptionally good sci-fi. interesting characters, great story, amazing visuals, brilliant sound. Five stars"
"508",4.5,"  This intelligent Sci-Fi thriller is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2018. It is a sad shame that it is far too brainy to have any success at the box office when it truly deserves it. The sound and suspense felt in the theater was definitely worth the ticket price and I would highly recommend your next movie night seeing Annihilation."
"509",4.5,"  Fantastic, disturbing, visually amazing"
"510",4.5,"  My mind right now is an absolute mess of thoughts, theories, ideas, questions, and potential answers all thanks to this incredible and intelligent sci-fi film from the creative mind of Alex Garland. Annihilation is best experienced knowing as little as possible, it follows a biologist named Lena (Natalie Portman) who signs up for an expedition to a place shrouded in mystery. And that's all you need to know before going in. The film is very loosely based on the 2014 Jeff VanderMeer of the same name but this movie undoubtedly has Alex Garland's fingerprints all over it. If you saw Garland's last film Ex Machina (2014) you'd know he has a knack for highly intelligent sci-fi that asks questions of society, highlights deep-thinking themes, and hides a lot more beneath the surface than above it. The movie is breathtaking, thrilling, terrifying, mysterious, and goes to places that blew me away and literally left me speechless.†I'm not going to go into detail about the story whatsoever but I will concentrate on Garland's execution which is undeniably flawless. The story progresses at a carefully calculated pace and divulges enough information periodically as well as posing enough pondering questions to keep you locked in at all times. As pieces start to fall together they also seem to be getting further apart and it's this back and forth throughout the story that will grab your attention very early on and never let go. It's never too slow, nor is it too fast and it's told in a way I initially thought would be detrimental to my enjoyment but it actually adds to your perception of events in ways I never thought It would. As was the case in Ex Machina, Garland exhibits a deft attention to detail to where everything ties together immaculately. I haven't seen this film a second time yet and I can already recall small, seemingly minor or insignificant moments from early in the film that hint at and tie-in to some later themes very subtly. It's this attention to detail that I love from Garland as it entices me to rewatch it multiple times and obtain new understandings as I did with Ex Machina. But of course, the multiple rewatches aren't necessary as from a single viewing there is enough to divulge your own understanding of events, so you can see it once or five times and feel its impact.¬†If you are outside the US, this movie is available on Netflix, but I implore you to see this on the biggest screen you can because the imagery and visuals are utterly breathtaking. Garland has bought over his cinematography partner from Ex Machina, Rob Hardy, and I'm very glad he did because his work is astounding. Some of the shots in here are framed in a creative manner that makes them stand out and just when you think you've seen the most well framed shot, he one-ups himself. There is a certain level of bleakness to the world we see here with a lot of dark, dull colours plaguing the environment but Garland uses a range of otherworldly colours to make scenes pop. I love what he does with colour because it makes some of the most disturbing, haunting, or foreign imagery actually quite vibrant and stunning to look at. Just like in nature, some of the most dangerous things are actually quite beautiful. Composers Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury have also been carried over from Ex Machina and have created score that comes and goes at the most opportune moments. Sometimes they allow the chilling score to set the tone and transport you to this place, and others they just let the sounds of nature do their job and it almost never falters.¬†As far as the performances go, I have no complaints across the board and it's no surprise when looking at the level of talent involved. The film follows a main group of five females played by Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tuva Novotny alongside Portman who are all great and each bring the most out of their characters. Portman is front and centre in most scenes for reasons pertaining to the story which I'm not getting into here but these other performances around her are so strong they never fall into the background and are constantly on your mind. They each have some powerful moments where they react to certain situations in ways unique to their characters' personalities so that works in strengthening them and their story arcs overall. In another reuniting from Ex Machina Oscar Isaac¬†joins Garland on this adventure and for a fairly limited role he makes a lasting impact that I again, don't want to expand on to retain from spoiling anything.¬†So, in the end, being a very intelligent sci-fi film and relying on a high level of engagement in what is going on and some interpretation on the audience's part this won't be for everyone. The slow calculating nature of events may not bode well with a lot of people as will the level of complexity it gets into with some of the themes and commentary it explores. But if you are a fan of intelligent sci-fi then this is absolutely one to check out immediately as Garland does incredible work writing and directing and every small story point feels relevant and connects in clever ways. The performances from the strong female cast are great and visually the film will capture your attention. It is unpredictable, goes places you'll never see coming, and an adventure well worth taking.8.8/10"
"511",5,"  A bREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTING, THOUGHTPROVOKING AND WELL CONSTRUCTED sCI-FI MOVIE THAT TRANSCENDS MAINSTREAM sCI-FI AND LEAVES IT BEHIND IN THE DUST."
"512",4,"  Everything a good viDeo game movie could ask for without being Actually based on a game"
"513",1.5,"  Loved the book ... the movie misses texture and suspense , and fails to develop characters that were fascinating in the book. It's an ugly film; great opportunity missed."
"514",4,"  Semi-fresh syfy even the swamp people could love....... Worth the ride. Women with guns!!For your $8, you'll get $9.38 worth of entertainment."
"515",5,"  annihilation was mind-boggling. i recommend this movie on every level!"
"516",2,"  Just totally misses on so many levels. some poor casting, pacing, color match & continuity, etc. and some of the absolute worst dialogue ever written, like it was written by a cadre of idiot studio execs sitting in a conference room. shockingly bad dialogue actually. Natalie is always wonderful but had nearly nothing to work with here. Probably the studio execs sticking them all in combat fatigues with guns too. that was poor judgment and denied each character their own distinctive and relatable presence, so became pasteurized and superficial. Ending credits animation as good as I have seen, best part of the film."
"517",3.5,"  I;m always happy when a movie like this gets past The Suits in Hollywood and hits mainstream cinema. It was very interesting and mesmerizing the whole time. Also it was weird and creepy and trippy and beautiful and neat and brutal. It was overall pretty interpretive, not blunt and stupid. The score was fitting, not that I liked it, but effective. Most of the acting was fine."
"518",3.5,"  trippy. I suggest you light one up before seeing this one."
"519",3.5,"  Engaging, visually impressIve, solid scifi film, with a touch Of horror and no cliches."
"520",2,"  Created an rt account just to pan this movie. i went because some views called it ""smart"" so i thought it would be. visually interesting? a little, but not remotely challenging or thought provoking. lacking that it was merely ponderous and pretentious. ex machina was smart, and extremely well directed, though i thought at the time the dialogue was not quite as strong as the rest of the movie. now i understand why.I didn't read the book. perhaps if i had i would give it more credit, but then, that would mean it's the book that impressed rather than the movie, no?"
"521",0.5,"  THE PLOT WAS BORING! IT WAS A SNOOZE. ABOUT AS ENJOYABLE AS WATCHING 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY..... YOU JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER. Needed more charACter development or supporting subplots to keep it interesting. PREVIEWS LOOKED GOOD THOUGH - THOSE WERE ALL THE GOOD PARTS THOUGH."
"522",5,"  One of my favorite movies."

"526",1,"  Interesting concept that was carried out very poorly. A serious disappointment."
"527",3,"  Did NOT MEANT TO WRITE ALL IN CAPS, BUT SOMEHOW THIS HAPPENED. INTERESTING MOVIE, GREAT ACTION, LITTLE BIT OF GORE. GREAT VISUAL FX,, THE SOUND IS REALLY GOOD AND THE MUSIC TOO, SOMETIMES THE MOVIE SLOWS DOWN, BUT THE STORY IS FULL OF HOLES THAT DONT MAKE SENSE. I THINK FOR THIS MOVIE TO WORK AT LEAST IT SHOULD BE BELIEVABLE. THE PHENOMENA HAD BEEN GOING ON for more than a year AND THEY WERE ABLE TO KEEP IT SECRET, YES RIGHT. IT'A AN EVENT THAT CAN DESTROY THE WORLD AND THE BEST THEY CAN DO IS SEND TEAMS OF 5 PEOPLE ON FOOT, NO CHOPPERS, PLANES, TANKS....YES IT LEFT ME PONDERING LONG AFTER THE CREDITS TO FIND MORE THINGS THAT DONT WORK.. i can go on and on about how the movie creates a certain logic to not follow it a minute later."
"528",1.5,"  i did not care for this movie at all. pace was way too slow. nothing exciting. my hopes for a good sci-fi were crushed"
"529",2.5,"  Annihilation is a hellscape in every way, with nothing redeeming save for the actors' commitment to their roles and an attempt (??) to address lofty themes - which failed miserably - but a little credit for the ambition. Thoroughly bland, unenjoyable, with visuals that are like a nightmarish version of a Wes Anderson film if he were high on acid and had lost his touch."
"530",5,"  weird but in a good way. loved how it was made."
"531",1,"  What were they thinking?"
"532",1,"  I saw the critics review and previous and was excited to see this film. It was bad. Just bad. The Dialogue. The pace. The plot. All Bad. IT annihilated two hours from my life."
"533",4,"  Great science fiction, a good slow burn."
"534",1.5,"  Nothing males sense in this movie. Almost every scene had crucial details unexplained, and There wasn't a Feeling that one scene even connected to another... it was just a compilation of wild visuals for unexplained reasons."
"535",4,"  Very spiritual and symbolic film. very original!"
"536",1,"  Hard core sci-fi fans with a brain best avoid this one. Some pretty visuals and a fun LSD fueled ending but none of it made any sense and the dialog was terrible. There was no convincing storyline and the only profound questions it left you wanting to ponder were to the effect of ?what was that that I just watched?? and ?I think that was bad; was it??"
"537",1,"  I get it. I understood everything they were trying to say thirty minutes into the movie. Visually it is stunning at the beginning, and then it seemed to get worse as the movie progressed (Let's just cover a bunch of trees with flowers and have them walk through the forest). Jennifer Jason Leigh, well her character is ridiculous and the ending of the movie just shows what happens when you want to please the audience at the expense of staying on message. Just don't waste your time on this failed tempt of art."
"538",3,"  Natalie portman's acting was off in this."
"539",0.5,"  Watch it on drugs and you may love it. Watch it sober and you'll wanna take drugs. Waste of time and money. Could have been and hour and a half shorter. Never establishes a theme or sense of mystery. Instead of wanting to watch the movie, I wanted to get to the end so it could be over. Very uninspiring, very weak, very boring."
"540",1,"  2 hours i will never get back"
"541",2,"  From all of these reviews, I find it really strange to see most of them rated fresh. It confuses me. Am I missing something? Did I wake up on the wrong side of the bed the day I saw this? I must have to watch it again because I can't see why everyone thinks this movie is a sci-fi masterpiece. I didn't like the movie at all, and sure it was something unique, (Well, not really, considering that it followed Arrival's concept) but it really just missed the mark for me. THe story had very little direction, the cinematography seemed off in most scenes, the acting wasn't the greatest, and most of the characters were bland and annoying to watch."
"542",1.5,"  Some beautiful and unique imagery, unfortunately completely marred by terrible pacing and dialogue. Brief scares interspersed with huge swaths of nothing. Predictable ending.Sci-fi, nothing. This is just a rote horror movie."
"543",2,"  MEh, this movie bites. Pacing sUcked, diALoque was lame, no character devolpment."
"544",5,"  This movie has action and mystery and makes you think. I highly recommend this film. It is one of my favorites."
"545",4.5,"  This film was such a brea of fresh air. Five lead female cast, and not a word in the advertising to market from tHis. There is really something to say about the state of film today when a brainless film like black panther can rake in a bill, and a great film like this barely breaks even. Anyway, for me, this film stands out mostly for its beautiful shots and gorgeous visuals. And not just the images themselves but the way shots are framed and composed. A good example of this would be when they are starring at the muril of death in the empty pool. Everything from the composition of the shots to the griZzly images seen are masterfully done. Some of the acting left a bit to be desired. Natalie portman was typical natalie portman but stil very servicable and quite great In some of the sc nes with less dialogue. All in all the performances of all of the characters were appropriate in the service of the story. Garland who Directed ex machina has a great talent for pacing his films out and sprinkling in just the right amount of back story to help flesh out characters but not at the expence of dragging down the story. At no point does the film lull, and there wEre no action scenes that felt inserted just to get teens to look up from their cell phones (black panter, wonder woman) the ending of the film doesnt tie anything up more neatly than it needs to. This is a film that respects your intellegence. This is a film that understands that the true substance of fiction lies in the personal interpretation of the veiwer. That is a rare thing to see on the big screen these days."
"546",4,"  lei los libros y aunque me parece que la lectura es pesada, la historia es interesante y el final es bastante inquietante, estoy ansioso por ver la pelÌcula y disfrutar la adaptaci√≥n."
"547",1,"  Very low energy, poor pacing. The dialogue is stale, stilted, painfully awkward. It appears that they went through multiple drafts and did not make sure that the end product was coherent. There are decisions made by the characters which assume the audience is very unintelligent. ""preachy,"" but not offering any vision or theme. i cannot find anything positive about this film."
"548",1.5,"  Not even close to the depth and interest of the books. Just a jump fest Which somehow managed to get Natalie Portman on board. Yuck."
"549",5,"  An absolutely astonishing film. Tense, brutal, and thrilling all the way until the last frame. Alex Garland has cemented himself as one of the best Sci-Fi directors on the planet."
"550",4.5,"  This is the movie I've been waiting for, very psychedelic visual effects. Reminded me of Lovecraft's The Colour out of Space, but even better. Encapsulates the fear of change."
"551",4.5,"  a positively disturbing movie that lingers for days. I highly RECOMMEND it."
"552",1,"  Jennifer Jason Leigh offers a completely vacant performance opposite of Natalie Portman's relatable character. information about each character is forced fed to the audience rather than occurring organically, revelations about the Shimmer come without reasoning as if the characters had read a informative pamphlet. The ending was forecast rather than foreshadowed, as in the books. Overall, wait to watch this movie until it is free on-demand or included with another streaming video subscription."
"553",1,"  it should be annihlated"
"554",0.5,"  The book was amazing but this movie puts jeff vandermeer's crEative writing to shame. None of the main theMes were explored and they added a whole new character. I am extremely disappointed!"
"555",1.5,"  Was really liking this movie until the ending. Very dissatisfied. Could have been a classic."
"556",5,"  First time I've seen the entire theater sit dead silent in their seats while the end CREDITS rolled, dumbfounded at what they just saw. Fantastic."
"557",5,"  i enjoyed this movie very much. like most science fiction movies today, i wish the plot would reveal more answers but other than that the movie possessed good plot development and mystery. wish they would come out with more movies like this,"
"558",5,"  Mindblowing. Unlike anything else in the scifi genre. An emotional drama, a riveting edge of your seat thriller with horror elements tHat draws you in and makes you question everything you thought yOu knew about existence."
"559",5,"  EXcellent Movie with top notch visuals that really makes you think. Tense moments and real beauty all in one!"
"560",0.5,"  slowest moving movie i have watched in a long while with absolutely no pay off in the end. I will never get those 2 hrs back"
"561",0.5,"  It was an absolute bore. Were it not for movie pass, i would have asked for my money back. How it has gotten an 87% rating on this site is beyond me. don't even bother, folks. save your money for something better."
"562",4.5,"  Great visuals and sound design, some good ideas and although I wasn't 100% satisfied with the end, it's worth watching."
"563",0.5,"  DUMBEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME ""Annihilation""This highly praised movie from professional movie critics makes me wonder if they literally saw this film on drugs. Annihilation was boring, stupid; and oh did I mention - boring?They advertise this movie as a horror flick, but I thought horror flics are supposed to not put your audience to sleep - literally.I knew the film started off on the wrong foot when Natalie Portman's character, Leena, explained to a small room of university students, that ""one cell turns into two, then two into four, and four into eight."" Of course, these students are surprised because apparently, the elementary school they attended never taught them basic biology. I mean, is that really how you want to show how smart your main protagonist is? Could you imagine watching Ghostbusters and having Egon explain to you that water is wet because it's a liquid?Ugh.The movie just gets dumber and dumber by the minute from there.I'm going to give some spoilers here because it's really waste of time to watch. There are so many logical loopholes in it, the plot shouldn't exist..The premise revolves around a comet that crashed into a lighthouse and created a rainbow bubble around it the military called the shimmer. The military sent soldiers into the shimmer for the past three years, of which none returned alive. That is of course, until Leena's husband returns, dying, and not himself. The shimmer is seen as a threat to civilization by the military as it is expanding, and in a few short months, it could swallow nearby towns, cities, then the United States.So of course, the logical thing to do would be to drop a bomb on the lighthouse, right? Not in this world of snowflake filmmaking.The logical thing to do for these screenwriters is to send an all-woman team of scientists, not soldiers, into the shimmering, to see what's going on. Because sending in alpha-male soldiers didn't work before.....And bombing the alien lifeform that threatens civilization is just out of the question. Because, you know, this is all about woman power.The women literally walk into the shimmering, it's not a forcefield, and it gets even more ""treehuggerish"" from there. One by one, they get picked off by the alternative reality they walk into. Apparently, the shimmering is your ultimate GMO, blending human DNA with plant DNA, and possibly other animal DNA. Everything is crossbreeding in the shimmer without any hanky-panky. Two of the girls get killed by some type of oversized bear-dog that can literally roar, ""help me."" Another girl submits to the shimmer and turns into a flower tree. And the last woman goes into the lighthouse, evaporates into a colorful rainbow.In the end, Leena finds out her husband killed himself with a fire grenade and that the guy who came back is a clone. She also confronts a clone of herself in the lighthouse, that is so good at duplicating her looks, it actually even duplicated her clothes too, not a nude version. Usually, clones can only duplicate bodies, not clothes, right? Leena and her clone engage in a modern dance struggle/fight. I'm not even joking there, it's really stupid. Then she kills her clone with a simple fire grenade and runs out of the lighthouse. The clone incinerates, along with everything the shimmer created.Leena is later interviewed and asked if the aliens were here to hurt us, she answers,""No."" Even though for three years, soldiers, her friends, and her husband, went in and all got killed. She then is asked if the alien is carbon-based, and she answers, ""No."" Again, stupid.... because apparently, everything the shimmer created burned down.The if the movie doesn't get any dumber, Leena meets with her cloned husband. Apparently, everything the shimmer created was destroyed when it died, except for the cloned husband. And when she hugs her cloned husband, both their eyes glow and the screen fades to black.And that people, is the dumbest movie of the year.Annihilation is based upon a book that apparently sold pretty well. So well, that hardly anyone lined up to see the movie."
"564",2,"  Pretty dull movie. They did a fantastic job with the previews to suck people in but a terrible job delivering a quality movie."
"565",1.5,"  After reading Annihilation by vandermeer I was excited to see this film, unfortunately the film is no where near the caliber of the book. The movie I saw was not the story I read and was a total disappointment. Its another example of an excellent book being altered and made into a poorly crafted movie. If alex garland had bothered to stay true to the original authors story he could have had a good film, instead he made a mediocre hollywood horror story. Not worth your time or money, read the book it is brillant!"
"566",4.5,"  Dark sci-fi with great acting. cgi is not over-the-top-- blends in nicely to give the film a realism that has been missing as of late."
"567",2,"  They created a beautiful world with tons of potential. The 5 person squad wasn't believable. Felt like they left a lot on the table. Really FELL apart at the end. Last 10 minutes or so felt like a graphics card benchmark/TESt. Wasted opportunity is what it felt like."
"568",3.5,"  I really loved the book and, sadly, this was not nearly good as the books. i would say go ahead and see it. the visuals and sound design are fun but some of the supposedly scary parts made people in the theater laugh out loud. so see if it you're bored not if you are a fan of vandermeer or the new weird movement."
"569",3.5,"  Annihilation is an intense, thought-provoking sci-fi film that doesn't shy away from big ideas. The superb atmosphere created in the first two acts will draw you in and the third act will either really work or really bomb for most viewers. A worthwhile view for fans of sci-fi that delivers plenty of mystery, thrills, and thoughts to dive into."
"570",5,"  I thought the movie was smart and very entertaining. I feel sorry for those who cant follow it or just dont get it."
"571",4.5,"  A unique sci-fi that brings together science and the complexities of the human soul. In trying to understand the unknown, sometimes we lose sense of what we thought we knew, and this movie brings you through that journey."
"572",4,"  Jesus movie theaters are doomed. Well, perhaps not theaters themselves. I'm sure Disney will provide plenty of Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars movies to keep the lights on. No, I mean moviegoers are doomed. We are going to an age where any serious material, such as arthouse horror or hard science fiction will go to Netflix or other streaming services to die. Some point out that such services could save dying genres such as these, but time will surely tell.In either case, we have another example of hard science fiction failing to connect - Annihilation. Annihilation is the story of an alien ""invasion"" that really isn't an invasion per-se, but an infection. After an alien anomaly lands near the southern US coast and continues to expand, the US government sends teams of soldiers and scientists to access the problem and stop it, if possible. One such all-female team includes our battered protagonist (Natalie Portman) whose husband has inexplicably come home after a year of no contact, devoid of personality and memory. If you think you have heard this story before, you would be correct...to a point. Annihilation takes bits and pieces of the serious science fiction of yesteryear with a dash of cosmic horror. Hence why it feels like a curious, but effective cross of The Andromeda Strain, Solaris, Alien, and Predator. What makes it even more interesting is how the infection is not necessarily hostile, it's merely remaking Earth's environment ""in favor of its new matrix,"" as Mr. Spock would say. Natalie Portman is well known for being selective in her roles in recent years and it would be safe to say that she has gambled correctly. She anchors the picture convincingly and reminds us why Hollywood invested so much in her two decades ago. (Jesus I am getting old.) Jennifer Jason Leigh and Oscar Isaac are great as you'd expect, but I have to nod quite a bit to the other members of the crew (Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny) for making their mark in what is an essentially a pretty downbeat film. Alex Garland has impressed before with his work on Dredd and Ex Machina, and his commitment to steady shots and earnest story telling outweighs any temptation for cheap visual flair.As for its financial failure, one could possibly attribute it to the very generic and admittedly awful trailer that advertised it. But it goes further than that. The studio, as usual, panicked that audiences would be too stupid to bother with such a movie and planned to dump it on Netflix shortly after its theatrical release - ensuring that much of its potential audience would not pay for something they could soon see at home for free. Perhaps even more glaringly, no attention was paid to its racially diverse, all-female cast. You would think that in our ""woke"" fuck-Trump-and-the-Patriarchy era, Paramount would fall all over themselves in advertising this. But here's the uncomfortable truth. Studio execs know what audiences refuse to admit to themselves - people only pay for schlock or middle-of-the-road entertainment. They want to see people who look like them blow shit up. And while that's perfectly understandable and even justified, (see my Black Panther review) it still means that movies in multiplexes are going to get dumber and dumber. And we can only blame ourselves."
"573",0.5,"  The only advice that i can give To those that wana watch this movie is to just pick a DIFFERENT film... This movie is Trippy as shit and if you wannA be tripping balls aftErwards then go for it! The genre is Labled Thriller and magical, its really just creppy. Also If YOU'RE one of those people That like to get high beFore a moviE or Been WANTING to know how it feels like to be high then pleasEeee watch this movie, i GUARANTEE You 100% that YOU'LL be walking out the theater feeling hIgh ??"
"574",2.5,"  This film has a classic premise, a director with a clear vision of what he wants the film to be, and about 8 minutes of really great practical gore effects. However, the film is bogged down by an extremely deliberate pace that betrays the danger at hand and forces the viewer to apply extreme focus to remain engaged when there's not a ton there to chew on at times. Plus an ending that will leave a lot of mainstream cinema goers who just want to munch popcorn and forget about the flick 10 minutes after its over scratching their heads and wondering what they'd just seen. I would say that this film deserves a least a try from everyone who enjoys sci fi or horror."
"575",1,"  So bad it's insulting. Cable TV quality, at best.-Canned, predictable dialogue-Lazy camera work, Every scene is a green screen-Several Irritating casting choices-Gives no reason for casting no men in main cast-As of the 75 min mark, when I left the theater, there was not one original idea or addition to the genreBasically it's Neil DeGrasse Tyson meets that bad all-female Ghostbusters knockoff. Really makes you wonder how Rotten Tomatoes and critics gave it such a high rating."
"576",5,"  A lowkey masterpiece commenting on the inherent violent tendencies of human nature."
"577",4.5,"  I loved it. Just pay attention and you'll be fine."
"578",1.5,"  Slow moving movie. Boring. Only a few parts that are good. I wanted my money back. Didn't really make sense. That is one movie that should have gone straight to dvd"
"579",5,"  Had my doubts when i saw trailer, but this film is very very good."
"580",5,"  Annihilation is many things. Beautiful. Otherworldly. Unsettling. Terrifying. Bizarre. Any many more. But above all it is brilliant. As horror, action thriller, high concept sci-fi and deeply introspective psychological study it works on every level. It's not a movie for the casual filmgoer, or one that is easy to wrap your head around. But for experienced viewers prepared to have their minds blown, Annihilation is a real treat.The premise is that Natalie Portman is Lena, a biologist who has lost her husband and travels into an area of altered reality called ""the Shimmer"" to learn what happened to him. No one knows to expect when they go in, because only one barely conscious person has ever returned. But nothing could prepare them- or the viewer- for what they find inside.They're on Earth. There are touches of the familiar all around. Abandoned shacks, bayous, alligators. But at the same time the inside of the Shimmer is in many ways a beautiful and alien as Pandora. It's not often you feel compelled to comment on the vegetation in a movie, but the flowers and trees they encounter are simply gorgeous, filling the screen will a whirl of colors completely at odds with the film's tone. The creatures on the other hand are pure nightmare fuel. They're recognizable animals but twisted in horrifying ways that hint at the deeper corruption all around them.Most of the best horror movies work because they stand as a metaphor for our deepest and most common fears. Alien was Rape. The Babadook stood for overwhelming grief. And Annihilation is about guilt, paranoia, and utter mental and emotional breakdown. It's fascinating and more than a little unsettling to watch how each of the main characters slowly become unhinged as they try and fail to come to terms with what they're experiencing. Some display an ever-growing sense of fatalism. Others flat out denial, or overpowering suspicion. In a movie where so much is utterly alien, their breakdowns are surprisingly realistic and nuanced. This could have worked solely as a psychological horror film. But of course the filmmakers weren't content to stop there. There's extremely frightening imagery and bits of gore, used sparingly enough to retain their full impact. The found footage from a previous expedition is literally stomach churning and will probably be too much for many viewers. There are even good jump scares. And oh, how the movie can build suspense. As they go deeper into the Shimmer the tension builds and builds and is held so long as to be almost unbearable. And the ending is simply beyond anything most viewers have ever seen. There are no words to adequately describe it, and to even try would spoil it. Suffice it to say that you will be in a state of utter wonder and bewilderment. There are many things about it I don't understand. But then they're probably not meant to be understood, or even possible to understand. The final act of this movie is Akira level mind-bending. It makes 2001 or Inception look simple and unambiguous. I have my own interpretations of some parts, which I think are what filmmakers intended. But for so many aspects there are no firm answers, only endless possibilities and the questions they create. And that may be the true genius of this movie. For all the terror, the wonder, and the wonderful acting, perhaps what Annihilation succeeds at the most is how much it will make you think."
"581",4.5,"  it didn't have a superhero in it, that's good enough for me."
"582",4.5,"  One of the strangest, most perplexing sci-fi films I've seen in a while. Definitely worth a second and third watch to untangle the puzzle of this unapologetically weird little film."
"583",4,"  Alex Garland's ""Annihilation"" is a unique, puzzling, and visually stunning work of science fiction. I found the movie to be interesting the whole way through and think it is a well-made movie. Visually the movie is both beautiful at times and horrifying in others, but all of it is effective. I do feel for the most part the movie builds tension and maintains an eerie atmosphere that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, there still are segments that felt uneventful and slow,†but even during these moments, you are treated to some impressive visuals. Natalie Portman does a good job in the lead role and her character carries the movie. There is a subplot in the movie that I felt doesn't really fit or contribute to the rest of it, but I wouldn't be surprised if I was just missing something. I did not see the final act of this movie coming and I feel that is where audiences will be most divided. I enjoyed the last act of the movie but I am still trying to fully understand what exactly happened. The ambiguous¬†nature of the film leaves plenty of room for discussions to be had. The film certainly isn't for mainstream audiences, but if you're a fan of movies that'll leave you scratching your head and leaving you wanting to know more, this one is worth checking out."
"584",3.5,"  THis movie is Definitely worth a watch. However, the acting bothered me throughout. Oscar Isaac acted like he was on drugs in most of his scenes, which I suppose was as intended, but made his performance very boring. Portman was the same character she always plays. Very flat, little emotion, unrelatable. Jennifer Jason Leigh was trying to channel some weird sadistic ""look at me I'm so unhinged and don't care about anything"" performance. Like Isaac's performance, I understand WHY you would go that direction, but with this actress, it just came off as weird and made me disconnected from the film. Overall, I feel like the film could have been cut down by 10-15 minutes, mostly because of the glacial acting, and would have been a lot better for it.Aside from the performances, the visuals were amazing and the story was unique. This will definitely become a cult classic in the future. For me, one viewing was enough, but I'm glad I saw it.?"
"585",5,"  sci-fi horror that sticks with you. doesn't hold the audience's hand - conjures a real sense of dread. great movie, but a shame no one will see it."
"586",5,"  brilliantly layered themes. it'll make you think for hours after it ends. if you don't like thinking, watch it anyway."
"587",5,"  WOw went into this movie not knowing what to expect, came out blown away"
"588",4.5,"  8.9/10. Great flick. Cinematography was dope. The confusion, crazy storyline, and theories is what makes it so good. I look forward to the next movie. Would watch again just to pick up the small details."
"589",4.5,"  An amazing sci-fi film that doesn't hold your hand."
"590",1,"  ConfuSing and muttles. Thought this was one of tHe worst movies ive ever seen in my life. My brain hurts fromThis. It felt like i took acid before seeing it."
"591",5,"  As of February 23rd 2018, there are now two movies that genuinely scare me. Pans Labyrinth and Annihilation. The concept of 'the shimmer' presented a terrifying nightmare fueled by science and the unknown and in all honesty, I've never had sweaty palms for so long. The antagonist was refreshingly alien, the lack of intention and confusion presenting a childlike force of rebirth. Though the film could have stood on its two legs with gorgeous visuals alone, every scene was highlighted by an amazing score and sound design. This movie was clearly written for cinema, as I felt utterly encapsulated by noise. Every note demanded my attention. On the surface, its one of my favourite horror movies - and that's what I thought as I walked out of the theatre. But Annihilation isn't a film that you forget about on the drive home. Or as you lay awake in bed trying not to think about screaming bears (How DARE you, Alex Garland). It demands a closer look and as you pick it apart piece by piece, each element shines under examination. Horror film, trippy science fiction, cerebral film about self destruction; there's something for everyone."
"592",2,"  Good visuals, strange plot that's almost embarrassed to embrace its potential. Only scratched the surface of character development.... But the entire movie is a close up of characters. Frustrating."
"593",1,"  The audience score is alot closer to What this dreary film deserves. The critics are praising what? Characters we dont care to follow ?A Script with meaningless dialog?The whole Geneitic angle that missing forwarding any intersting ideas to ponder Relating to humans tickering. Sonething Garland achieved beautifuly in ex mechina. If this juSt a aCtion film such as predator, it does not engage as a survivAl story."
"594",0.5,"  Ok. I will keep it simple. I LOVE complex, confusing movies. Loved the directors other movie. This movie however, is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I am not sure where or how any decent ratings are coming from. Everyone in the theater also was baffled, confused, laughing at the film (not the funny parts) and disoriented. The film had no purpose, an resolved nothing. It was complete garbage and the ending was so predictable. Again, I repeat. This is by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. I cannot think of another movie that was worse than this. I think people feel they ""have"" to like it, or that it is more complex than it is. To not like it would mean they are stupid. But don't be tricked or lie to yourself. This is the worst movie ever made (on a hollywood/higher budget scale)Terrible and without purpose or resolution.."
"595",5,"  This movie is just flat awesome. Go see it."
"596",5,"  An original and engaging story, well executed in every way. If you are sick of everything being either a remake or a sequel then do yourself, and everyone else who feels the same, a favor and support this film!"
"597",1.5,"  vERY PRETTY, AND MAKES NO SENSE. fLAWED PREMISE (APPLYING A BIOLOGICAL IDEA TO THINGS THAT NEVER CHANGE)."
"598",5,"  This movie is not for everyone, but if yOu are an imaginative, creative, curious person who enjoys things that are different and ""out there"" then you will likely atleast somewhat enjoy this moVie, and many of you will Absolutely be blown away by it. Reading the negative reviews That have been wRitten for this movie should tell you everthing yOu need to know About the type of pEople who disliked It. Many Of them have Forgotten that not Everyone has to like what they like, and Hate what they hate. People can have different Opinions."
"599",4,"  This was an awesome dark sci fi film. Intelligent, though provoking and all around enjoyable. Why is no one talking about it? Are people that addicted to dumb that a smart film is always released quietly by Hollywood these days?"
"600",4,"  It starts off really interesting and makes you feel like a lot is going to haPpen, in more of an action movie sort of way but then really changes gears to a relatable sCience fiction film. I might go see it again tonight."
"601",3,"  Well... So this is about a supernatural disaster area. It is slowly expanding, and there is very limited knowledge about what exactly is inside of it, given that everyone who has ever entered has failed to return. A biologist (Natalie Portman) volunteers to join a team of ladies as they are the next up to brave the unknown. Now I was actually pretty pumped for this because this is Alex Garland's follow up to the terrific Ex Machina, a movie that I hold dear to my heart. He seems to have a passion for science fiction, so I am going to make a point of following his career moving forward. With Annihilation, there are definitely moments that satiated me throughout, but I was unfortunately left feeling more underwhelmed than I had hoped to be. Now I tried my hardest to get with this. I was able to take the slow pacing, and to be honest, it didn't even bother me all that much, as it felt like it was a deliberate choice made by the director. I like that this cast is almost entirely female, and if there is a movie that passes the Bechdel test, it is this one here. I like all of the science-fiction touches, and Alex Garland isn't exactly a lightweight in that department. He gets some really quality camerawork in with some gorgeous imagery in this surreal dimension. It is really a mystery at heart, and I dug not knowing exactly where it was going, and this is a story that never over-explains, so you are always interested... but as you can probably guess, I am about to drop that other shoe. I have given a lot of thought to this, and I think my biggest problems with this stem around the ending. This puts me in a tough spot as a reviewer, because I never want to be the one to spoil a story for you. What I will do is split the difference and say this: I didn't like the ending to this because I spent so much time investing myself into this story, and for it to wind up being something that is so trite just turned me off. It kind of cheapens all the nice touches that I had previously enjoyed so much, and I feel that there is a pretty good chance that you will walk away from this with a sour taste in your mouth. I also don't think it is as deep as Ex Machina, but hey, this may all just be me. I strongly encourage you to make up your own mind for yourself on this."
"602",5,"  Most interesting original sci-fi horror drama in a long time. left the theater thinking. also all female cast where the actress/characters are treated and writen like real people. I enjoyed it, and it lingered with me long after i watched it."
"603",0.5,"  I walked out about halfway through. I never really could understand any of it. fair warning ;)"
"604",4,"  Suspenseful, intriguing, and a breath of fresh air, Annihilation proves that Alex Garland's Ex-Machina success was not a fluke. Natalie Portman shines as biologist/professor Lena, a character who has nothing to lose and is therefore free from the fear of death that affects the average person. Portman plays Lena with a curious intellect, believable traumatization, and a cold aloofness; there isn't really any reason to like her character, and yet you still find yourself rooting for her to succeed. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays an even quieter and more remote/emotionally hidden psychologist, delivering some of the starkest yet most thought-provoking lines. Tessa Thompson plays a shy physicist, Gina Rodriguez plays a cynical paramedic with some humor, Tuva Novotny plays a geologist, and Oscar Isaac plays Portman's husband, Kane, who is always not saying something. A simple criticism that can be made about Annihilation is its lack of character development. There is a familiar pattern of one by one they all get picked off until there is one left, and no matter how grippingly the movie does that, the overall lack of any investment or development of a character outside Lena cannot be overlooked. We learn a bit about Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, but little about anyone else. The rest of the crew is portrayed as having personal reasons for going on what is essentially a suicide mission, but this is barely explored. The second half of Annihilation quickly becomes the Natalie Portman show when it really doesn't need to be. However, Annihilation is a mind-bending and sometimes challenging film with a little bit of everything for each type of audience member. The visual effects are grandiose, the movie is full of psychedelic imagery that looks like it came from Wonderland; the only criticism I have of the film's visuals is its incessant calls for lens flares, which cheapened too many shots that didn't need them. There are horror elements as well in the film. These are not too scary for those easily frightened, but several scenes are extremely tense and some images will stick with you beyond the theater. The dialogue, while not as interesting or provocative as in Ex-Machina, is still sharply written and thought-provoking. The score does an excellent job at setting the atmosphere within the shimmer; it helps you feel the danger in certain scenes more intensely and the nerve-racking ending in particular is heightened by it. Speaking of the ending, I feel this is where audiences will be divided. The last 20 minutes or so take the film to a whole new level, the craziness and wow factor of the whole thing multiplies. While watching I wanted to know what was going on, but I was too busy screaming in my head ""What is happening!?"" I realized later there wasn't much to analyze and the last shot of the film wasn't hard to see coming either. I believe the whole sequence was meant to represent the movie's central theme of self-destruction, but it could have been more. I'm not disappointed with how Annihilation ended, but I can't say I was fully satisfied either. When a movie has such a great build-up and you become engrossed in the plot, curious to see what the characters discover next about the shimmer and what's inside it, it can become difficult to keep the wheels tightly fastened to the vehicle when racing to the end.Annihilation is a good sci-fi film with some staggering imagery. It captivated me, had me on the edge of my seat, and left me wanting more. But its conclusion, coupled with its shallow supporting characters, kept Annihilation from reaching the level of great sci-fi (cough...cough...Blade Runner 2049)."
"605",5,"  This movie is fantastic slow-burn 70s-style sci-fi horror. I guarantee that you'll be still thinking and talking about it for days after seeing it."
"606",2,"  This movie was a bad version of Predator. I almost walked out 1/2 hour before it ended, due to a crazy storyline and overacting. D+"
"607",4,"  A fun and imaginative movie with some creepy scenes that will make you uncomfortable. The relationship between natalie portman's character and her husband unfolds throughout the movie and provides a unexpected twist. This movie gives you plenty to think about after you leave the theater which Is a good measure if it was worth watching or not. it also has great visuals including some cool and frightening mutated animals and plants. maybe the freshest sci-fi that I've seen in a while. a nice escape."
"608",3,"  I didn't understand Ex Machina, but some podcasters I like enjoyed the movie ( rather saw merit in the movie) so I thought I'd give it a try. It starts off slow, but is well acted. There's not a lot of action so my attention wandered a bit. It is intriguing that it's an all women team. That was an appeal for me too. But it is a weird movie. It's just very weird. At the end I was like, ""Okay. Enough of this."" I was glad to be done. I must say, though, and it must be emphasized, Natalie Portman is a badass in this movie! I was like, ""Whoa! Was she in the Israeli army or what?"" She doesn't mess around. She really should be doing action pictures. If she want itty-bitty she probably would. But she walks like , ""Hey I'm not playing!"" And she carries herself with such power. Just.... whoa! Yeah Natalie Portman rocked this part."
"609",1,"  Save your money and your time. OMG, I'll never see a Nat port movie agian w/o reading reviews. 87%??? WTF??? Worst movie of the last five years."
"610",4,"  A great film that makes you think. Sadly, these films are fewer and far between. catch it in theaters before it's gone."
"611",3.5,"  such a strange movie... even stranger than the book. Some really interesting things going on, and some amazing visuals, but it really started to drag in the middle. 3.5/5"
"612",3.5,"  To describe what the movie 'ANNIHILATION' is in one sentence or more is pretty difficult to do. With that said, if you enjoy watching engaging Sci-fi materials, such as black mirror or twilight zone, I think you'll have good time watching this. The actings are pretty good, visual effects are pretty cool for small Sci-fi movie and good production values overall. The only flaw of the movie will be its high concept and theme that is in the movie, because most people won't understand or want to understand what they have just watched (or experienced) thus leaving the audiences with negative reviews, for lack of better words. At the end of the day, I do hope people will check it out...??"
"613",4,"  Weird, creepy, Good! Interesting story. Sorry for the all caps. Can't turn off."
"614",4.5,"  Liked it, chased a few rabbits that didn't make since and sadly had to add a bunch of F words in the middle for no reason."
"615",4,"  This was a really Smart Sci Fi movie! Super creative and devoid of typical hollywood cheese. I can see how the ending would be pretty polarizing with audiences but I have to say I didn't mind it. One of those movies where I kept thinking about it the next day."
"616",5,"  Amazing. Still thinking about the ending the morning after."
"617",0.5,"  How could so many people be so wrong about a movie? I viewed the trailer and it looked like an exciting, action-packed film involving some cool science fiction. Instead, it was a borefest into a nap. There is no action, there is horrible acting, there is literally no plot other than going into the shimmer, and there is no conclusion to this so-called ""great"" movie. do yourself a favor and save two precious hours of your life and watch anything else."
"618",3,"  BEING VAGUE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING VAGUE IS VERY VAGUE.I AM A BIG SCI-FI FAN.THE MOVIE HAD ITS GREAT MOMENTS, BUT THE STORYLINE WASN'T ONE OF THEM."
"619",3.5,"  I saw this film last night with friends. I thought the concept was brilliant and freaky too. Great visuals and use of light and color. Acting and characters were good. There were some scary moments including one genuinely terrifying one.But...While I loved the idea and visuals, the story sort of went a bit off kilter near the end. I would say the first 3/4 are good, but the payoff at the end was lacking for me."
"620",3,"  OK STORY LINE. PREDICTABLE. GRATUATOUS SEX SCENE FEELS LIKE IT WAS FILMED WITH EACH PERSON AT DIFFERENT TIMES SINCE THEY ARE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN IN THE SAME BED."
"621",5,"  Alex Garland plus Natalie Portman plus Sci-fi Horror, A must see movie indeed."
"622",5,"  Best movie I have seen in a long time. definitely going on my top 10 list. (yes, they shouldn't have put in that 1 scene. otherwise, so so good)"
"623",1,"  I'm a fan of the director and cast, but this is one of the worst films I've seen in some time. The coolest shots are in the trailer and there isn't much more to the film than that. The story is garbage. obtuse, incomprehensible garbage."
"624",3.5,"  INTENSE. Disturbing. A good movie if you're looking for that sort of thing."
"625",1,"  (WARNING: INCLUDES SPOILERS) THIS MOVIE WAS FAIRLY BAD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES, WHICH IS VISUALLY IMAGINATIVE (ESPECIALLY THE MIRRORING IDEA). WITH THAT SAID, I OFTEN FOUND MYSELF CRINGING, BORED, STRUGGLING TO BUY INTO THE CHARACTERS BACKSTORIES OR STRUGGLING TO FOLLOW THE WORLD'S / FILM'S LOGIC.WHY WOULD A WOMAN WHO IS AN EXPERT IN CELLULAR BIOLOGY WALK INTO A POTENTIALLY LETHAL ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT A HAZMAT SUIT? WHY SEND A GROUP COMPRISED OF ENTIRELY WOMEN, WHERE BIGGER STRONGER MORE EXPERIENCED MALE SOLDIERS FAILED TO GET OUT SAFELY, UNLESS AT LEAST A FEW OF THE WOMEN HAVE A BACKSTORY THAT INCLUDED SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THEM AS EQUAL OR SUPERIOR SOLDERS OR WOULD MAKE THEM MORE SIGNIFICANTLY LIKELY TO SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT (UNLESS THEY WERE THE ONLY OPTIONS LEFT - WHICH THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THEY WERE)? WHY ARE THE WOMEN WALKING INTO THE SHIMMER? GUNS WORK IN THE SHIMMER, WHICH ARE MECHANICAL, SO WHY NOT A CAR? OR A HELICOPTER? WHY DIDN'T THE TEAM GO INTO THE SHIMMER WHEN THE EDGE WAS MUCH CLOSER TO THE LIGHTHOUSE? WHY IS THE WATER CLEAR IN THE BOTTLE ON THE BASE IN THE SHIMMER IF IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE FOR MONTHS (OR POSSIBLY OVER A YEAR) WHILE A MOSS LIKE SUBSTANCE SEEMS TO BE GROWING ON EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE ELSE? AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WE DISCOVER THINGS ABOUT HER HUSBAND THAT MAKE US QUESTION WHY HE WAS THROWING UP / SICK IN THE BEGINNING? I'M JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE HERE. THERE WERE HOLES EVERYWHERE IN THE PLOT. NEXT, THE ACTORS WERE OFTEN DISCONNECTED FROM EACH OTHER. NATALIE PORTMAN IS A GREAT ACTRESS, THIS IS THE WORST PERFORMANCE I CAN REMEMBER EVER SEEING HER GIVE, AND IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE OF DIRECTING ISSUES. IN ESSENTIAL SCENES SHE'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE OTHER ACTORS. IN MULTIPLE SCENES I THOUGHT, ""IF I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT, THAT'S NOT HOW OR WHERE I (OR THE OTHER PERSON) WOULD STAND, MOVE, OR HOW I WOULD REACT VERBALLY OR NON-VERBALLY.SO MUCH OF THIS MOVIE AND THE SCRIPT FEELS FORCED AND POORLY THOUGHT OUT. IT'S DONE TO BE DONE, NOT BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE FILM. THE MAIN CHARACTERS HAVE TO GO TO THE LIGHTHOUSE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO GO TO MAKE THE MOVIE WORK. THE WOMEN WENT INTO THE SHIMMER WITHOUT HAZMAT SUITS SO THERE WOULD BE MORE CHALLENGES / WAYS FOR THEIR BODIES TO BE PHYSICALLY AFFECTED BY THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE SHIMMER. IT'S ALL WOMEN LEADS BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE WITH AN ALL FEMALE CAST (I DON'T MIND THIS, JUST RATIONALIZE IT - WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THESE PEOPLE AND NO-ONE ELSE? - THEY ALL HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, FEEL GUILTY FOR SOMETHING, OR HAVE A BACKGROUND IN SCIENCE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH). WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY, NATALIE PORTMAN'S REASON FOR GOING INTO THE SHIMMER WASN'T DEVELOPED ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT SHE SHOULD GO IN.I'M SUPER DISAPPOINTED, IF IT WASN'T FOR THE ""BEAR SCENES AND POST BEAR SCENES"" WHICH GOT AN EMOTIONAL REACTION FROM ME BECAUSE THEY WERE JARRING, OR THE CLIMAX SCENES BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT THAN THINGS I'VE SEEN IN OTHER SCIFI ALIEN MOVIES, AND THEY GOT MY IMAGINATION GOING, I WOULD ARGUE THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE THAT I'VE SEEN SINCE NINJA TURTLES, AND THAT'S THE ONLY MOVIE I'VE EVER WALKED OUT OF A THEATER BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS UNWATCHABLE."
"626",4,"  wow. very original and different. extremely well made. visually mesmerizing. well acted. and the sci-fi aspects are fantastic. thought provoking and fascinating, creepy and terrifying, hits on many levels. well done (1 viewing)"
"627",1,"  Prefacing this by saying I'm a huge Ex Machina fan, and was excited to see what project came next for Alex Garland. And I can honestly say that it was like watching Tarantino direct ""The Room"" after previously creating the masterwork ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie made me feel insane. I desperately wanted to like it, but the lack of coherence and inane unfulfilled plotlines made it all but unwatchable, no matter how high i was (hint: not enough). This generation's ""The Happening""."
"628",1.5,"  Did not care for it. left me with the same empty feeling after seeing 'space odyssey 2001', which was, huh? What is going on here?"
"629",5,"  Was fuckIng awesome! Must see!"
"630",5,"  Dreamlike. I'll be surprised if there's a better sci-fi movie this year. Much better than the book, Garland took a great idea and made a great film. It owes a lot to Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker which is based on the novel Roadside Picnic. Annihilation swims in visual effects at the expense of character development. Outside of Portman's character the other roles were props. If the film failed at all it was here, where a film like Alien(s) can define a minor character in a single shot and line of dialog, Annihilation seemed to preoccupied with developing the environment as a character to notice, which ends up being its greatest strength and weakness."
"631",0.5,"  It was terrible. Dont waSte your money."
"632",3.5,"  Kept me engaged, orginal."
"633",5,"  Best of the year so far."
"634",0.5,"  worst movie in the entire history"
"635",5,"  this movie f**ked my mind"
"636",3.5,"  NOT YOUR average sci-fi flick, annihilation keeps you on the edge of your seat as it morphs into a psychological thriller that will keep you guessing not just at what's happening, but what it all really means."
"637",0.5,"  Terrible , boring pointless. Wasted 2 hours of my life for this?"
"638",5,"  One of the best sci fi movies ive ever seen. if you love blade runner 2049 and those kinds of movies youll love this! if you want explosions and stupid crap like in thor or the avengers you probably wont"
"639",2,"  What a waste. great creature effects, but the rest of the film is a two-hour nap. bad dialogue. shallow, emotionally dead characters. lots of blatant exposition.(and no, you can't rationalize this film by comparing it to tarkovsky's solaris.)great book, but skip the movie. two stars."
"640",0.5,"  This movie is a hot mess! How it has gotten an 86% blows my mind. It was pure torture sitting through this from beginniing to end!!"
"641",2,"  disappointed.., more a drama about broken women than a Sci Fi adventure"
"642",4,"  It's an interesting sci-fi film that has a lot of beautiful and sometimes horrifying imagery. More of a slower moving, high-concept sci-fi rather than a strait-up thriller. It's worth seeing."
"643",5,"  Books Were amazing....and Natalie Portman .....oh...shiiiit."
"644",4,"  Trading substance for surreal ambiguity, Annihilation is a disturbing hypnotic dive into the unknown"
"645",5,"  When someone asks me what a 5-star rating means, I usually say, ""No matter its faults, it's constantly arresting and engaging throughout its entire runtime."" I think this did that with flying colors."
"646",5,"  amazing movie that's worth a watch"
"647",5,"  The Full Blown ""Annihilation"" of My MindBy Derek ElsholzMarch 1, 2018WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADAnnihilation is a novel by Jeff Vandermeer that has come to your local big screen. The director of the movie is Alex Garland, the director of Ex Machina. In Annihilation, a meteor strikes within a game preserve in the swamps of Florida. From this meteor, a shield termed ""the shimmer"" begins to spread outwards in all directions and anything that goes in never comes out. Our story begins with the protagonist Lena (Natalie Portman), an army biologist. Her husband Kane (Oscar Issac) is a part of a secret Roy force that remains unclear throughout the novel. The movie opens up with Portman believing her husband is dead because he has not yet returned from a mission that he departed over a year ago. However as she is painting their room, he walks in through the front door, up the stairs, and into the room, drawn and distant. She hugs him and begins asking him many questions about his mission. However, he does not seem to have any knowledge of the situation and begins to vomit blood. En route to the hospital in the ambulance, government vehicles pull over the ambulance and knock Lena out with a sedative. She wakes up at a secret military based named ""Area X"" and begins to get interrogated by a psychiatrist Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who also doubles as the base official. After she sees her husband in a coma with his condition deteriorating quickly, she decides she wants to go into the shimmer to find the cause. A group of 5 females enter the shimmer including: Lena, Dr Ventress, anthropologist Cass Shepard (Tuva Novotny), paramedic Anya Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez), and physicist Josie Radek (Tessa Thompson). Their mission has one final goal, to reach the lighthouse in which the meteor hit and get out. On their way to the lighthouse, the team begins to notice many new strange half breed animals and plants, They get attacked by a alligator with shark teeth who almost kills Anya, and then a bear wolf that kills Shepard. They closer they get to the lighthouse, the more signs they see of Kanes old team, even finding an old camping spot with a video tape left behind. On the tape it shows Kane and two others carving open the stomach of one of their team members. As his skin falls away, his insides begin to move like snakes and Kane drops the knife in the water. As Lena's team is wandering the base, they come across a tumor like growth in the swimming pool, and Josie finds the knife in the water. Later that night, the bear attacks and kills Shepard and the group carries on in the morning. As they prepare to camp again before nightfall, Josie makes the realization that everything in the shimmer is ""refracted"" back into the environment, including DNA. This explains all of the mutations and messed up gene pool. As the night falls, Anya begins to question whether or not her team is going crazy so she ties them up. She begins to interrogate each of the members as she tries to figure out if Lena killed Shepard. However, right as she is about to cut Lena's stomach open, she hears Shepards screams outside. Frantically she sprints outside with a rifle trying to save Shepard. As the door opens to the tied up team, the bear walks in with its mouth open and Shepards scream pouring out. Right as the bear is about to kill the team, Anya comes in rifle blazing. The bear breaks through Josies chair and grips Anya by the throat, effectively killing her. As the bear turns to Lena, Josie unloads a rifle clip into its head. With only three members left, Dr Ventress decides to leave by herself before the sun rises. Her curiosity and deteriorating health condition pushes her to leave the team. Around this time, both Lena and Josie begin to notice the gene mutations occurring within their own bodies. Josie decides to not ""fight"" the changes anymore and lets her mutation take over. As she walks away from Lena, she is seen sprouting plant branches and leaves from her arms. Lena loses sight of her around a corner and when she looks into the field, Josie is no longer there. Alone in the shimmer, Lena pushes forward. Around this time we begin to learn Lena had an affair with a colleague while Kane was away. As she nears the lighthouse, Lena finds the bones of Kanes former team. Cracking open the lighthouse door Lena finds the room filled with white vines with a hole in the center and a skeleton burned against the side wall with a camera facing towards it. Playing the video, Lena soon sees her husband in the screen. However, this is where the movie begins to get tricky. As the video progresses, Kane is seen talking to someone else with a grim voice. As Kane tells this mysterious person to "" Tell Lena I love her"", the stranger fills the screen This other person, is Kane... Yes you heard me right. Kane is talking to a doppelg‰nger version of himself with the implication it is going to leave the shimmer. As the video moves along, Kane is given a sulfur grenade by his doppelg√§nger. He sits cross legged and pulls the pin on the grenade, dying in silence within the ball of fire. Lena then draws the courage to crawl into the hole, gun loaded. As she reaches the end of the black tentacle filled hole, it opens into a small chamber. Dr Ventress is seen talking to herself with her eyes appearing to be gone. As Lena approaches, Ventress's eyes come bac and she begins to talk to Lena. As the two characters exchange dialogue about what the aliens want, Ventress opens her mouth and a beautiful light begins to pour out. The room is soon filled with this alien light and Ventress's body is slowly turning into into this light. With the transformation complete, the light is turned into a rotary of color resembling an eye. As Lena looks into the center and is drawn closer, a drop of blood floats into the center of the figure. Suddenly a humanoid figure begins to form. With a shimmer color metal, the humanoid figure begins to assemble until it is a piece of shimmer metal representing a human perfectly. Lena realizes to late and begins to run out of the chamber. As she enters the lighthouse, the alien is there reflecting every movement Lena makes. When she tries to fight it, it fights back. When she tries to run, it almost crushes her against the door. She drops to the ground unconscious and wakes up to the alien still reflecting every movement she makes. As Lena becomes more and more hopeless, the alien begins to morph with her facial features. As doppelg√§nger Lena is staring Lena right in the face, Lena grabs a sulfur bomb and hands it to the alien. With both the doppelg√§ngers and the real Lena's hands around the bomb, Lena pulls the pin and runs away at the last second. The alien bursts into flames. As the alien is slowly burning, every altered from that contained the shimmer particles begins to slowly burn. As Lena leaves the lighthouse and the alien crawls, burning, into its chamber, everything is shown to be burning down that the alien had affected. We come back to a room that Lena is getting interrogated in by men in hazmat suits. She finishes telling the story and asks to see her husband, who is now recovered. As the two reunite, Lena asks Kane ""if it is really Kane or the alien"". Kane responds with I don't know. He asks the same question in return, and Lena just hugs him. She never responds.... As the movie is drawn to a close, Kanes eyes are seen changing into shimmer colors, with Lena's doing a more subtle change.In his interpretation of the novel, Garland brings a variety of color and brightness that somehow seems dangerous. As the screen changed hues and my eyes are mesmerized by the colors, the undertone I was receiving danger within the beauty. The visuals of this movie were excellent, keeping me in a trance by this alien, but human, environment. The acting in this movie is decent with Portman doing an excellent job selling her role. Even though there was not a lot of personal attachment to the characters, I did not want them to die. They each had unique, likeable traits that made them seem like normal human beings. We do not receive much backstory about the characters, but I still felt as if I knew them. This may be in part due to their attitudes and roles on the team. However, even though there was foreshadowing of the members death throughout the film, the movie did a good job keeping me on my toes on the aspects of their deaths. The plot line in this move was excellent and was executed perfectly by Garland. However, I would have liked more backstory rather than flashbacks on Lena's behalf. If I had felt more of an emotional connection to Lena, it would have made the film even better. Although this seems like a standard sci-fi/thriller movie, it gets above and beyond when it comes to the metaphorical and figurative layers. Every action, scene, and plot twist had layers of meaning that could be interpreted differently depending on the viewer. Each character death led to a major theme of fighting, running, or letting death take you. Although there were many metaphors and analogies laid throughout the film, the ending left me feeling confused, but breathless at the same time. As the credits begin to play, I found myself staring at the screen, brain is shambles, as I tried to comprehend what I had just viewed. After a serious 15 mutes of hard thinking, I began to make theories about the ending. Was it the monster that escapes and was trying to persevere with an excellent lie? Or was it really Ln end forever changed by the shimmer? Yet, it was not these questions that gave me a lasting impression about the movie. The questions that made this movie stand out from any other movie were those of figurative or metaphorical concepts. I know what you are thinking. No one cares about the analogies or metaphors. Trust me, I usually just show up for the explosions, car chases, and adrenaline as well. Yet, as I walked out of this theater, my mind twirling, I began to ask myself questions that did not have to do with the plot line, but with the message he was trying to convert. Was Garland trying to say that we must kill our old selves to become better new people? Was he trying to say that in our modern culture we care to much for material or surface things (the shimmer Lena) and if we do not develop strong morals or relationships that it will lead to our downfall? This movie is the most layered Sci-Fi/thriller/action movie I have ever seen. It still has me questioning and trying to find new endpoints a week after I viewed it. This movie has created a lasting impression on me that I will never forget. It is a piece of art that is receiving negative reviews for being confusing. It is not meant to be a ""see bad guy and shoot"" type of movie but rather a movie that should invoke questions about your own life. It is not a surface movie, but rather a deep meaningful one. For all of the reasons listed above I give the movie a 10/10, for excellent acting, plot, visuals, but most importantly, meaning. This is a must see. Whether on the big screen, or on your cellular device, check this movie out, and I promise you will not be disappointed."
"648",4,"  A refreshing cast followed by a compelling storyline. The science isn't really explained even in a fictional sense and the ending was very vague. The cinematography and overall film aesthetic creates a breathtaking backdrop for a thrilling film with traditional cosmic horror elements."
"649",3,"  A pretty well-made, simple story about an alien presence on Earth with stunning visuals. It shows the human failure to understand any intelligence that doesn't think along the same veins. Was it good? Yes. Did it do justice to the complex protagonist character and the psychological nature of the overarching story? Absolutely not."
"650",1,"  I don't understand the obsession of having a white married women cheat on her husband with a black man and that they had to show the sex scene. I don't understand the obsession of putting this in the movie other than the last few minutes of the movie this was boring alien movie the actors never meshed together"
"651",3,"  ""Annihilation' should have been more appropriately retitled ""Synthesis."" Because this movie is not about destruction, as such, but alteration, and combination. Alteration of perceptions of life. Alteration of the environment. Alteration of one's own concept of mind and self.Combination of talents. Combination of perspectives. Combinations of disciplines.My main concerns with the movie was its all-too-standard ""and then there were none"" horror movie structure. Someone gets killed by a beast. Someone mentally snaps. Someone succumbs to their environment. And, of course, the tired ""split up the party even though we know we are dying off one-by-one.""The movie was visually mesmerizing and the plot was compelling. But I felt a lot of the women characters were only given about five minutes of screen time and then shuffled off, mortal coil-wise, to increase the requisite body count.I had wished there would have been more ensemble problem-solving. More to show how women, collectively, would have solved this mystery differently than all-male squads of soldiers.I also felt it was utterly unbelievable how this operation was handled. Why not go in a few feet through the Shimmer, then come right back out?For that matter, why risk human life at all? Why not send in a fleet of drones?As for the climax, I have an overt spoiler alert: the one white phosphorus (WP) grenade resolution of the threat was about as unsatisfying to me as learning that Triffids were allergic to salt water. I can understand that might have stopped the one creature, but why did everything else collapse? The shimmer? The crystals? It all unraveled without explanation.There was, however, redeeming satisfaction in the denouement. Which I hope they leave open-ended and do not ruin with any plans for a sequel."
"652",3,"  visiually phantasmagorical jungle and incomprehensible weird nonsense in parts. Natalie PORTMAN is a mere waif of a girl, hard to imagine her as a rifle totin' adventure hero-ine."
"653",5,"  **ANALYSIS/SPOILERS**During my first watch, I spent a long while asking Where is this going? Where am I being taken? even as I was transfixed. Each flashback, found video, artifact, and character choice shaded in new details, but the overall shape remained hazy.Until Lena walks into the lighthouse, and my heart lit up in recognition.Between the body and the video, it's evident what's happened in the lighthouse and that the Kane that appeared at Lena's house was not the Kane who came in. For me, that was the key to my entire understanding of the movie.""You ever get out of here, you find Lena,"" Kane tells himself. As soon as I saw that, my thought was, he escaped because a piece of him loved her enough. That empty person who shows up outside the bedroom--all he has left is his love for her. His compass can't point to north, it can only point to her The cascade of understanding that followed was one of the most intense experiences I've ever had, not just while watching a movie but just as a person. The continuing imagery of the film supported and expanded my interpretation. Lena sees exactly how most of Kane died. Then she delves even deeper and is forced to confront the existential horror of Ventress's an-nihil-lation and the organism at the center of the Shimmer, which uses a drop of her blood to imitate first her morphology, then her movement, and finally her face. When Lena hands her copy a grenade and runs, it doesn't move to follow, mirror, or stop her. Lena makes a choice to destroy it and save herself, and that solidified what I'd begun to read into movie, the lens through which I was now reexamining everything that had come before. My perception of meaning spread forward and backward in time from that one moment, unfolding into new spaces with every new look. Annihilation is about therapy itself. The actual, internal process of first learning to see and then to deliberately, constantly destroy maladaptive parts of yourself, accept influences and impulses you cannot change, and make yourself the person you want to be. For all its fixation on inevitability, genetic programming, the impulse towards self-destruction, the faults in God's blueprint for life, Annihilation is about the distinctly human possibility of rising above all of that destruction to intentionally create something.To save her relationship, Lena undertakes an identity-altering journey to confront herself and what she's done, helmed by a psychologist and dragging all of her guilt, grief, self-destruction, determination, and love along with her. Why does the team wake up with no memory of their first days in the Shimmer? Because anyone's first attempts to tease any meaning from the web of subtle and conflicting information we find when we examine ourselves and the infinity of influences on that Self is futile. Upon beginning the process of therapy, you're mostly just noticing how unmindful you've been, floating forward in time, steered by impulse. You have to learn how to learn, how to determine what is a reliable and useful observation, and when it feels like nothing is, how to move forward anyway.The team examines the evidence--how much they've eaten, which direction is south. Similarly, in therapy, you latch on to something promising, or just the most solid thing you can find, and you explore that. From here on out, everything looks new, impossible, inscrutable. As you learn to acknowledge the internal, environmental, and interpersonal ways you build your Self and how they compound and refract each other, you're forced to acknowledge that you simply are all of your decisions and reactions. Those pieces come from somewhere and go somewhere, and you can study the ways you find yourself feeling controlled or in control, the ways you're affected by everything around you and affect everything in return. You can learn that while the entire process is indeed inscrutable, your patterns within it are not. Those connections are at times both beautiful and terrifying because understanding yourself--enlightenment, if you will--requires complete acceptance of yourself as a collection of experiences and actions, and some of those are very, very bad.The composition of the team of scientists works on so many levels. As far as we know, they're the first scientists to enter the Shimmer; the previous teams were soldiers. This illustrates the ways that trying to force yourself to change without serious self-examination is futile; there is no brute-force solution to fixing something broken within yourself. Everyone becomes a scientist once they begin to examine themselves, to gather evidence and conduct experiments and analyze relationships between variables. Perhaps the best equipped is both scientist and soldier, someone who can face and win the necessary fights along the path to healing; as Ventress tells Lena: ""A soldier scientist. You can fight. You can learn. You can save him.""There's also the explicit textual version of the team: a group of women with little to lose, lots of baggage, and bad coping skills. I've read a lot of opinions that the dialogue on the boat felt unrealistic; I'll agree that this scene gives so much away with so little subtlety that it's not just poor dialogue, it feels out of place in an otherwise uncompromising film. It felt like a studio note: ""put something in there that explains the whole theme of self-destruction!"" However, since we're given it so explicitly, might as well note how neatly these women seem to each have one particular challenge they're facing: Ventress's mortality and lack of connection, Sheppard's grief, Thorensen's addiction and the suggested anger issues fueling it, and Radek's numbness and inability to be vulnerable/honest. Lena is consumed by guilt; it's revealed clearly enough that she knows Kane was aware of her affair and that it was that betrayal that pushed him to volunteer for a mission into the Shimmer in the first place.A little more abstracted: The team is literally led by a psychologist whose singular goal is to reach the source of the problem (notably, Lena's problem, since it holds the answer to saving Kane). Those who accompany Lena help and hold back that quest at varying times; however, at their cores, Radek, Thorensen, Sheppard, and Ventress aren't there to examine themselves. They're too caught up in their self-destructive cycles to get past what's holding them back. Whether it's recklessness, anger, or fear, psychopathy is in control. This applies to Dr. Ventress as well. While in-character Ventress is swept along at the whim of her impulses, her explicit distinction between decisions and impulses at the watchtower illustrates the central conflict of the movie. Yes, she reaches the lighthouse, but she's drawn there impulsively, desperately. Rather than decide how to react, as Kane and Lena do, she is destroyed by her own nihilism. Expectations and your belief that you have some control play a huge role in the success or failure of therapy; if you don't go in believing you will gain something and willing to learn, you're not going to do either. If you are too afraid of change and the ways it is inherently the death of something, you cannot change for the better.So we watch the team break down and the individuals within it break down, in a variety of figurative and literal ways. For me there were simultaneous journeys at each of the previously described levels of abstraction. We have five individuals faced with utter confusion and terror, and we see the ways each person can or can't face, deal with, and move on from the challenges. This reflects the ways real people you interact with while undergoing a therapeutic process can help or hinder your efforts, particularly people who are also suffering from mental illness. The hyper-reactive environment illustrates the various coping methods and the ways the characters and environment begin to absorb and regurgitate each other. Even more abstracted: Each of the struggles faced by the team is also affecting Lena, specifically in relation to her affair. Guilt is dominant, and there's the glimmer of hope she has now that some part of Kane has returned. But this is therapy, so we have to work backwards. The affair doesn't take place in a vacuum. We see a little of Lena and Kane's relationship in happy flashbacks, but we learn a lot more about it from Dan. Kane's inability to share his inner life with Lena or connect with her intellectually is mirrored in Radek's numbness; Lena turning to someone else for that connection is just another version of self-harm to satisfy a desperate craving for feeling. We know the affair wasn't a one-time thing, it was an addiction for Lena, stimulation she used to fill the emptiness Kane was unable or unwilling to alleviate despite its corrosion of not only the marriage but ultimately all of Lena's relationships, including her concept of herself. And of course, at the beginning of the movie, Lena is grieving the death of her husband in the wake of the death of trust in her marriage. She can't even grieve as a wife without inflaming her guilt for pushing Kane away, seemingly to his death, without ever being able to admit, apologize, atone, or explain. Like Ventress, she's just stuck expecting but never quite achieving the certainty of those deaths, unable to share her pain; similarly, she jumps at the chance to use the fact that she has nothing left to lose to at least try to find answers that might allow something she cares about to outlive her. The affair is so central to Lena's motivations on so many levels that I have trouble understanding some of the reactions I've read that say the character motivations felt muddled or that they can't understand why anyone would go into the Shimmer. We have one obvious perspective character, and she has one obvious goal: saving her husband's life because she both loves him and feels responsible for his near-death and the pain that preceded it. At the beginning of the movie when she asks if she's allowed to go home, Ventress says ""Is that what you want?"" and Lena says ""I want to be with him."" There are a million beautiful details, but that is the only point. And the only way to do that is to enter the Shimmer and learn everything she can about what happened to him. He asked her to save him, to save them, and she rose to the challenge. It just turns out that inside the Shimmer, she's forced to face what she did to him, not just from her perspective, but from his. She learns how certain his death was when he chose to go in, the disintegration of self that he watched his teammates succumb to. The house in the abandoned settlement in the Shimmer is a copy of Kane and Lena's house. It's no accident that Lena is faced with the bear-monster inside that house, the nightmarish union of a loved one stolen by and then entangled with an unpredictable predator. For Kane, during the affair, he was trapped in that house, tied to a marriage, hearing screams and moans he never wanted to imagine, trying not to give away that he even knows the problem's there. Just as Thorensen blames Lena for Sheppard's death through her inaction and her dishonesty for destabilizing the group's efforts going foward, Kane feels responsible for pushing Lena away, to someone else, irreversibly damaging their relationship and taking with it the trust on which any future might be built. Thorensen explodes when she finds her trust betrayed but instead of attacking only Lena directly, she ties everyone up and traps them in the house--as Lena's choice did to both her and Kane. Thorensen screams the words Kane wanted to say to Lena, who is forced to look those accusations in the face. Then, literal ghost of their earlier actions haunts them in that house, stalking the walls they've put up to hide their feelings from each other (targeting Radek) that feeds it before finally being neutralized by Lena ending the affair (Thorensen's death) and Kane's decision to volunteer for the mission (mirroring Radek's self-harm, need to do/feel something coping mechanism--she kills the bear) that solves nothing except the most immediate, superficial problem (the bear/affair). Ventress, with her inability to form romantic or familial or even friendly connections, leaves immediately, just as any possibility of Lena and Kane communicating did.I think it's crucial that it's after this moment, and after Ventress has left the group, that Josie chooses to radically change herself. Not only has Josie, as a character, been examining herself as she trekked through the shimmer and seen the possibilities it presents, but Lena can finally empathize with Kane's pain (after the bear scene) and thus connect with him. It's time for Josie, as a character, as a symbol, as an aspect of Lena, to find resolution. Josie uses her sudden self-knowledge to find the new way ""to feel alive"" that Sheppard said she was searching for, becoming a haunting, beautiful monument to the peace that is possible through acceptance and vulnerability. This is the same decision Kane makes. ""Imagine dying frightened and in pain and having that as the only part of you that survives."" Kane chooses, like Josie, to make sure that part of him is not the part that lives.By entering the Shimmer, Kane underwent his own therapeutic process, and lost so much of himself along the way. However, he also learned what he needed to do and found the strength to do it. We see Kane's character arc out of order, so it's a little hard to piece together, but it starts with the man who left on a suicide mission rather than call out his wife for cheating and actually talk about his problems. The depiction of Kane in the video found at the the abandoned base is brutally practical. He is able to make decisions and act under the direst of circumstances in the service of his goals, which are actually pretty selfless. This shows that Kane is rising to the challenge of the shimmer. If he had been able to slice open his marriage to show the corruption underneath the skin rather than ditching Lena without ever addressing the affair, well, there wouldn't be a movie. It was this strength and singularity of purpose that allowed part of him to escape the Shimmer and demand commensurate action from Lena. He finds the resilience to reflect deeply, the humility to accept his part in things, and finally the ability to choke out the words ""I don't think I'm well"" to the one person he needs to tell. For me, the idea of whether he is ""the same person"" is irrelevant and unknowable. Indeed, we don't know which Kane is the ""alien"" and which is the Kane that walked into the Shimmer, or whether that question is even relevant based on how much of the original Kane was in each body. When we find new strength or new darkness in ourselves, are we the same person? How much change would it take to make us a new person? Isn't that the essence of being a person, to be in a state of constant change and not notice until it happens abruptly and painfully? All these questions, then, arise in the moments between Lena finding Kane's body/the camera in the lighthouse and meeting the alien. I immediately interpreted this as the death of Kane's cowardice and weakness and lack of clarity, and the survival of the Kane who, above all else, wanted to find his wife. I think Lena did, too: she watched all of his depersonalization, his questioning, his avoidance, just disintegrate into certainty. She knows as well as us where the Kane who lives goes: home, to her. In the darkness under the lighthouse, Lena catches up with an eyeless, presumably sightless, Ventress. As an individual, she's unable to process her fear of death. She's so consumed by the knowledge of death encroaching throughout her body that she can't see anything beyond that ending. She can only interpret what she finds there in terms of her end. Is that why the alien doesn't approach her to create a copy? In the framing of this meeting, we see light and dark paths behind Lena; only darkness and dead ends surround Ventress. She hasn't reached any deeper understanding of herself or created the new, stronger person she needs to become to find acceptance in the face of her imminent death. Instead, she dies terrified, projecting her own feelings onto the forces of change. As a symbol, we see her literally annihilated, by the definition I included at the beginning of this piece: She becomes light. She never sees that light, but Lena does. The enlightened Lena faces the alien presence that morphs to look and act more and more like her. We've caught up to the moment I described earlier, and the crux of the movie. We see alien watch Lena, mirror her, hold her, to her disgust and horror. What is it learning from her? At first has no gendered features, but a prominent belly button (its human essence, the idea that it was born, is exaggerated through this and the birth imagery of the cave), while not having enough information yet for social construction or exchange. This made me wonder how much time Kane spent with his double, a much more developed copy. It has learned the details of his appearance, his language, even a bit of his heart. We know Lena spent four months in the Shimmer and Kane spent maybe twelve; presumably, a lot of that was here, at the lighthouse, getting to the point where his dying words to his alien self feel like a benediction to a friend.The one thing the alien mimics instead of mirroring is Lena's attempt to run away. The alien runs the same direction and ends up holding her back from that goal, nearly suffocating her against the wall of the lighthouse. It's a literalization of the futility of running away from your problems, from your darkest impulses, and most crucially for Lena the consequences of her actions, instead of facing them. It also shows that what the new Lena is learning is the worst of her, the things she needs to overcome. When describing the alien to Lomax she says she doesn't think it wants anything; I think it's more accurate to say that its wants, its impulses are learned, just as all of ours are. They are only a mystery because we didn't pay attention to being taught. Lena has now learned how to do that, thanks to the Shimmer, and she knows what to do if given a second chance. Lena chooses to destroy the new thing and leave, and the Shimmer's distortion and exaggeration is destroyed with it. We don't know, and even she doesn't know, if she made the correct choice or if Kane did, in starting over. She has shut the door on what that person could have become. The Kane that kills himself is a shell full of the things the wanted to leave behind, because you can't leave the Shimmer without owning your choices and acting with purpose. You get out by adapting to the chaos and learning to constantly locate your evolving self within it. It's meaningful that, instead of sitting with Kane's body, Lena's alien crawls back into its lonely hole to die, disconnected and alone, surrendered to destruction like Ventress. Lena saved the part of herself that loves Kane.Obviously, the person being questioned is different from the Lena who went into the Shimmer. We'll never know all the ways that's true; even Lena probably won't. None of us can fully comprehend or control the ways we change over time, we can only control our choices and accept responsibility for the person we are even as we attempt to study all the uncontrollable factors that influence us. Understanding is not a moment; it's an unending process. It's work with surprising, unpredictable moments of reward. What we do know is that the Lena who got out wants nothing more than to embrace the husband she's saved, and that husband, whatever new person he has made, hugs her back. Their reconciliation is the moment both of them get what they singularly wanted and worked for and died for and rebuilt themselves for. And you don't get to that moment of peace, that new beginning full of renewed trust, without every bit of that work. Our sentience is the key to turning off the thoughtless, impulsive destruction we're pulled towards over time: it allows us to see ourself in where we have been, what we've done, and what can be created. Therapy, or any self-reflection, is itself a continuous mutation.Annihilation is a love story about two shattered, disintegrating people who actually love each other enough to go through the pain and work of changing, of building a more complete, more resilient, and more loving self. As someone who has been the Kane at the top of the stairs, asking someone else to acknowledge their part in my destruction only to have them do nothing, as someone who's been into the Shimmer to save myself, to make something new, many times, that's transcendently beautiful to me."
"654",2,"  Annihilation is a dark movie with long periods of foreboding combined with brief and intense action scenes. Lots of flashbacks, many of which seemed pointless (like the ones with Natalie Portman's character and her colleague). There was also that odd and for me unsatisfying ending. I could never identify with the characters; all of whom were under the influence of... (opioids?). Perhaps the screen writers suffered from same. A lot of money was obviously spent making this movie (great cast, great FX), but it was ultimately a muddled and boring mishmash."
"655",4.5,"  Compelling and gripping sci fi thiller that kept me guessing! It would 100% suggest this to any avid sci fi fan. Unique in its own right ! Loved it"
"656",2,"  Just surreal in the visual aspects and subject matter, on the whole a bore that does not end correctly. Everyone around me got the same feeling walking out, like they had been duped."
"657",4,"  I definitely glad I saw it in the theater. Trippy movie for sure. A very unique movie and Visually striking."
"658",0.5,"  This was a mind-numbingly awful film with only one redeeming quality....the credits. It is unclear what film other critics watched in order to give this tedious collection of disjointed scenes the rating they gave it, but perhaps they too spent too much time in the 'Shimmer'. Spoiler Alert: That is what they called the slowly spreading anomaly resulting from the meteor strike that opens the film. The only thing moving slower than the anomaly was the acting and the actual film itself. The statement ""exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll"" can only mean we will eventually realize the fact that we enjoyed the popcorn more than the film."
"659",5,"  Amazing film, very poetic"
"660",3,"  The intriguing trailer with ""The Alien"" melody sold me on watching Annihilation in theaters instead of waiting for it to appear on Netflix. The synthesized notes promised an eerie, captivating, and horrific journey into Alex Garland's adaptation of the first book of the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy. And horrific is right. Horrifically disappointing.The film follows Lena (Natalie Portman) and fellow scientist/volunteers into a mysterious ""Shimmer"" that changes the land it encroaches upon. All of the previous military volunteers that have entered are never heard from again, except for Lena's husband (Oscar Issac). In order to save her husband from mysterious health problems, Lena joins a group of scientists to study the ""Shimmer"" and reach its core at the lighthouse. Interestingly enough, the group is all female, which reflects our current climate of the all female dream team (Ghostbusters, Ocean's). The film has a great cast with amazing performances, blah blah blah. Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the negatives.In the ""Shimmer,"" the group makes groundbreaking discoveries, while attempting to survive. But the film digs its own grave when it comes to caring about the characters and building suspense due to its opening, which shows Lena post journey out of the ""Shimmer"" being interviewed by scientists. She mentions who dies, who goes missing, and the very fact that she's there in a lab room confirms that she survives as well. So scenes later where danger is imminent, we already have a good idea as to what will happen. Talk about fun.When we compare Annihilation with Alex Garland's previous sci-fi film, Ex Machina, the flaws become obvious. Unlike Ex Machina, Annihilation is not focused. It's an adventure, drama, fantasy, horror, mystery, and thriller. There's the aches of love, the influence of psychology, the beauty of evolution, the creation of monsters, the existence of aliens, and the crisis of existence. The film spreads itself too thin, with more ambitious topics than there are baddies in Spider-Man 3. I would rather watch a story that delves into one or two of these ideas, than try to tackle many parts of a different whole.Like Arrival (which is a much better alien mystery), Annihilation relies on several twists of its own. But compared to the weight that they're given, the twists don't hold enough impact or surprise. You could even say that the final twist is a failed attempt at an Inception like ending. With Inception, viewers are so engrossed with the dream world and its implications that the twist of whether Leo's character is still in a dream or not comes naturally. In Annihilation, a question is asked in the end which falls flat on itself like a teenager trying to sound deeper than s/he actually is. The question shouldn't have been asked. It easily takes away the buildup of the final scene and makes the whole ending laughable.David Ellison, financier at Paramount, was concerned that the film was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"" and wanted changes to be made to appeal to a broader audience (in order words, dumb it down). I couldn't disagree more, not for the same reasons as the director, but because there's nothing complicated about the film. Intellectual? Sure, it deals with science. But the actual science within the ""Shimmer"" is completely fictional and relies on the entertainment value to make any of it believable. Complicated? Now that's just an insult to moviegoers. Although don't be surprised if you run across several people who bought into the film as thought-provoking. On the surface, it's shrouded with stupendous fantasy. But at its very core, like the one in the ""Shimmer,"" it is as purposeless as the alien that lives there.Chad: 3/5 (Still, the movie is really pretty (e.g., effects, Shimmer, Natalie Portman) and the soundtrack is chilling.)"
"661",1.5,"  The idea of this movie is great, but it was very slow and boring. I would suggest you wait until it comes out on iTunes and not waste you time or money seeing it in the theaters."
"662",2,"  The beginning of the film was superb, cerebral....then it got dumb, boring."
"663",5,"  I'm probably gonna be talking about this movie all year. There are personal criticism and objective. Objectively speaking no one can deny this is a brilliant film. It has phenomenal production design, excellent and emotional cinematography, a brilliant and thought-provoking story, and brilliant performances and execution all around. ""Annihilation"" is a triumph of cinema. A true ""modern-day classic"" of a film if there ever was one. A film that falls into the category of films that embrace Big Ideas in ways that presuppose viewers are intelligent and attentive. Is that asking too much from the average movie-goer? Full of fresh perspectives and a powerful message ""Annihilation"" makes you think. It makes you wonder about the mysteries of genetics and the fragility of DNA. It makes you think about what happens when parts of the body no longer feel familiar and how quickly those changes can arise. It asks about the human capacity for self-destruction and it explores the power of guilt.Garland deserves all the praise he is getting. And should apologize to no one. The studio should be ashamed for limiting this film."
"664",5,"  Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina. Being one of my favorite films of that year, I found myself extremely excited for his next directed project. Annihilation has just hit theatres and if you're not someone who enjoys a slow burn in order to reach a worthy payoff, then this movie may not be for you. If you're up for anything and can embrace any sort of sci-fi story, then here's why I think you'll probably end up loving this movie as much as I did.Going into detail about the plot of this film would truthfully ruin it, so I'm going to explain this premise as simple as I possibly can. After having to deal with a tragic personal incident, Lena tasks herself with a group of women who plan to enter a forcefield area that has been created after a meteor has hit. Learning that they may not all come out alive, they strive forward to find the answers. Yes, that sounds very vague, but it's hard to talk about this movie to someone who hasn't seen it. For a premise like this, you need a few key things to make it work; A great screenplay, a great cast, and a nice through-line of direction to hold the movie together.Annihilation is a film that places its characters first before anything else, and while that definitely works in its favor, if the story surrounding them doesn't work then the overall film will fall pretty flat. Although it takes itself very seriously and many of the scenes are very slow-paced, you can tell that Garland has created a film that will slowly reveal itself as it goes along, providing insight into the backstory of each character as well as providing answers as who what exactly they're trying to uncover. Flashing back and forth between the past and the future, answers are given at the most opportune times in order to benefit the film.Natalie Portman remains a powerhouse when it comes to dramatic performances. I've always been a fan of her in pretty much any dramatic role and this one was no exception. That being said, she's not the only one who shines here. From Gina Rodriguez to Tessa Thompson, each of the supporting members seemed to have their time to shine and certain inciting moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some truly thrilling moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I know I'm a sucker for great sci-fi films, but this is just another one to add to the list.In the end, while I can't say everyone will love this movie because I'd be lying if I did, I believe that everyone can at least admire the attempt at being different and unique from most mainstream movies out there today. Annihilation takes risks and doesn't give itself up to a generic conclusion. It chooses to be different from most films and never lets its foot off that peddle. Wonderfully directed, very well-written, and beautiful to look at, I can't really come up with any huge complaints. Yes, some will complain about the pacing and few may even complain about it being too bizarre in its final act, but I found these aspects to be a great addition. Annihilation is a fantastic movie and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up in my discussion for best films of 2018 at the end of the year. The year is still very young, but I can't recommend this movie enough. Go in with an open mind and you may just love it."
"665",2,"  Bad science fiction. Terrible adaptation of a trilogy that made more sense. The oft repeated line I don't now in the movie echoes the writers skill."
"666",0.5,"  Might have been the worst movie I've ever seen.The characters had potential but the story completely fell apart. I love Sci-Fi but this movie was a turd. I almost walked out but I forced myself to sit to the end in hopes that there would be a twist or something that would make it worthwhile, but there isn't. The only reason to go is for Natalie Portman."
"667",5,"  Starting off my stating ""The Thing"" is my all time favorite movie. This film with its tone, characters, look, ambiance, sounds and premise is now in my top ten. Definitely in love with Garland's work since ""Ex Machina""."
"668",3,"  Movie was on the edge of boring. Had I been home I would have turned off the TV. IT had great special effects however, the plot was weak."
"669",5,"  You probably won't understand this movie until after you've experienced an event that changes your life forever..."
"670",2,"  If you've read the book, you'll probably be pretty disappointing with the movie. They rush through a lot of the most interesting elements in the book, and made changes that completely change the ending. Meh."
"671",4.5,"  I thought this was a really good movie! It was beautiful, trippy, tense, exciting, and leaves you with questions that crave answers. It felt like art and yeah. I thought pretty much everything about this movie was good. Music, acting, visuals, imagination. I'm digging this filmmaker."
"672",3,"  This movie was just average science fiction. Was it entertaining? Barely. It was predictable and had a ""safe"" ending. Definitely wait for Redbox on this one."
"673",2,"  Aliens meets Species. Meh"
"674",1.5,"  Seems to have left everybody in the audience wondering what just happened. It did some annihilating ok, on $24.00 that I wish I had back!"
"675",2.5,"  I just seen it tonight and from what I seen and looked the ongoing reaction from the people inside the screen room. I was not to good and I have to admit I love movies like this. But all I can say is its ok to watch at home. Save your money and wait until it's available on DVD."
"676",1,"  Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen."
"677",2,"  I really liked Director Alex Garland's first movie Ex Machina - it's slow paced worked for it and paid off in the end. Annihilation started off similarly, but couldn't get out of its own way.At a certain point - I just gave up on the characters. There was nothing there that tied them together, nothing that made them compelling for me or made me care for them or their plight. The attempts to to try to add a bit to Portman's character just fell flat for me. It's a shame, because there are some great actors there that just didn't have the characterization or script to make it work for them.I like science fiction and this could have been great science fiction firmly rooted in a little bit science fact (with the needed wiggle room). Instead we get a slow build with no real payoff and more questions and answers. In the end those questions that we are left with are just questions that I really didn't care about.The effects are well done and the movie looks great. But, that couldn't save what just became a mess to me. I hope Garland can rebound with his next movie."
"678",0.5,"  First time in many years that I felt like writing for my money back. Plot FSuspense ACharacter development FEditing BIG FStupidity A+Value F-People of Earth, save your money and don't let pay this director ever again. Natalie Portman, you should be ashamed of yourself!"
"679",3,"  Wanted this to resolve with some answer and it did not tie up very well. It is a beautiful movie visually and well acted. I felt like it had a unique story, but it did not resolve clearly."
"680",5,"  Amazing movie. Every part of this movie was unpredictable"
"681",1,"  The acting was so bad. There was no plot. Could have been a great story line for a second but failed big time."
"682",4,"  It's marvelous how fascinating it can be to see humanity reflect upon itself and its purpose when cornered on the brink of annihilation. However, this thought does not accurately summarize this film: humankind is not necessarily facing obliteration here nor are these reflections portrayed as natural and external but rather as forced and internal. This movie's a bit difficult to describe.....It can be safely assured, though, that the film is a surreal, dream-like experience with fantastic visuals and legitimately challenging questions. The term ""annihilation"" is explored in a few different, yet enthralling ways, the predominant of which being from a cellular perspective. The nature of the human structure in its simplest form is a composition of cells as are the structures of every living thing; though the cellular characteristics are unique between organisms, the cellular structures tie all of them together. Considering this eerie biological similarity between all Earthly life, the film then dares the audience to question the distinction humans have from any other life form. What relevance does humanity have to a greater purpose when, structurally, it blends in with everything else? The film's title is further studied in the idea that the true annihilation of the human race would not come from some external force or invasion but rather by internal means. Specifically, the focus here is on self-destruction, exemplified by Natalie Portman's character in the form of grief and in other ways by all of the women on the expedition. The film approaches its questions both literally and psychologically, effectively driving you deeper into ""the shimmer"" with the characters as the plot progresses. It's a very intriguing and challenging sci-fi thriller that recalls movies like Under the Skin and Ex-Machina (this director's previous film). It's gorgeous, strange, fascinating, eerie, mind-boggling, creative, immersive, clever, and I really enjoyed it."
"683",0.5,"  As big long time sifi fan, IMHO this flick is awful, simply awful. No character development. I could not have cared less about the fate of these opaque characters. Story line riddled with numerous holes, absurdities and inconsistencies. The moldy sponge ball alien was laughable. A boring pointless sex scene that the director was so proud of that he used it not once but twice during the movie. But the worst aspect is the complete lack of casual relationships....stuff just randomly happens in this film. I'd prefer to have watched Plan Nine from Outer Space or Monster Robot. At least those are cult flicks that make no pretense at aiming for adequacy."
"684",0.5,"  This movie is terrible on so many different levels it's hard to describe. Story is total nonsense. Acting is horrible. Background music makes you want to tear your hair out."
"685",1,"  This film was so uncomfortably quiet to see in a theater, I don't believe anyone actually enjoyed their popcorn! Storyline was so slow and so predictable I should have walked out."
"686",5,"  I read Jeff V.'s novel, really liked it and felt this was excellent--although not 100% faithful--adaptation (and that's OK--there were elements the movie did better, in my opinion). The screenplay took some liberties to create more visual tension and excitement without losing the fundamental question of ""what does it mean to be human"" and ""what is the meaning of life""? I think this belongs up there with other ""big question"" movies such as Blade Runner. The pacing reminded me of ""Arrival""--thoughtful nuance and backstory interspersed with action and unveiling. I disagree with other critics that the characters were wooden and needed more development. They are developed just enough for us to care for them and to show their humanity and their imperfection--but their complicated back-stories don't bog down the fantastic discovery in the movie. This is great entertainment, excellent acting, and fantastic imaginative visuals--saw it twice and enjoyed it immensely both times."
"687",1,"  Worst movie I've seen in some time. Plot terrible, irrelevant special effects. And the bad guy is ""the shimmer"". Who could possibly like this movie???"
"688",1,"  Annihilation was terrible. Total disjointed crap. First, after other expeditions went in and did not return they decide to send in another, totally inapt and unprepared squad to see what was going on. The director must have been a totally mutton head."
"689",1.5,"  If you loved the premise of Lost then suffered the irritating ""conclusion"" that left much unresolved, Annihilation is cut from similar cloth. Great concept that appears to be too complicated for the writer to get himself out of. Character motivations for early decisions are undercut by later reveals in what drove them. Characters you want to like, but cannot ultimately care about. And, while I know its getting raves for those graphics and effects...looked more like the were out of the 70s version of Planet of the Apes. Save your money and the 2 hours."
"690",1,"  Dam I was so bored ....Crappy slow story ....."
"691",3,"  C+, average at best but wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better then the horrible ""ARIVAL"" and CONTACT put into 1! 75% fresh if you must! Very SLOW!!!! was that just to make it 2 hours? they EASILY could have made it into 1h 40 minnutes! I think it would have been better to watch it at home, I Honestly enjoyed the CLOVERFEILD PARADOX more!!!!!!!!!!"
"692",4.5,"  Annihilation could have easily been a bad movie, I mean you have a trailer that doesn't show you much and isn't widely seen on television. A film company that apparently doesn't think the film needs any advertising dollars, and isn't released to many theaters nationwide or even worldwide whatsoever.All of these things tell you this film is going to bomb, but you go to see it anyway because you like Natalie Portman, and what you do see in the trailer does pique your interest a bit.And by the end of the film you are not only pleasantly surprised, but left wanting more, much more. And that is how I felt when I left the theater tonight.First let me get this out of the way, the film is incredible. It's easy to describe, but the complexity of what is portrayed should leave you wanting more. It is intellectual, but that is not a bad word, or it should not be at least. I don't think you need an MD proceeding your name to understand the technical aspects of what the film is there to teach us, about biology, psychology, and humanity as a whole.At times the film does become technical, however ignorance of the content at large should not make you dislike the film, only rather want to understand it a little more. But for those who despise science, or intellectual content in general, you kind of get a monster movie, somewhat and also it has some action, intermingled with dialogue and some very intense, truly terrifying moments.It is truly the reason why science fiction exists, and why we like it as readers, and movie goers in general. It tingles the senses in all the right ways, and stimulates the brain when it needs that stimulation, but most importantly it never over reaches beyond its plot, its story, the meat of things. And the story is very simple: There is area, called the shimmer. It grows larger with each passing day, and anyone who enters it, doesn't come back. And that by itself is the start to a great science fiction plot. And it would be easy to lose itself in a basic, sci-fi movie of the week way by throwing monsters at us, bludgeoning its cast into an ever growing body count, and tossing a little sex in there at times to keep things interesting. And for your sci-fi movie of the week that would be your average trashy B movie. However, here it has some of these things, and still manages to give us an intelligent, well crafted, well acted, intriguing story that challenges the sci-fi movie story paradigm we are all used to seeing on screen.My only gripe is the title, which once you have seen the film, and understand what annihilation technically means, seems as somewhat of a misnomer of sorts. It may be intentional, I did not read the book, though I just purchased the trilogy on Amazon to read very soon, but I'm unsure as to why its named as such right now.Getting beyond that, I praise this film highly, and intend to purchase it as soon as it is available to watch on blu-ray merely to listen to the commentary while watching it again.If you like science fiction, you should love this film."
"693",5,"  Don't worry about Natalie Portman's character, her marriage, her affair. Just surrender yourself to the rabbit hole this movie takes you down you won't be disappointed."
"694",4,"  A mindfuck of a movie that left me wanting more. Frankly, I think I need to see this again to see if I can gain additional insight from subtleties I may have missed. Additionally, was delighted by some of the soundtrack choices, especially the song by Moderat (among my favorite recording artists), 'The Mark (Interlude)', used near the end during the trippiest part of the film; an inspired choice for sure. Worth a look if you like thoughtful and somewhat impressionistic films that finish ambiguously."
"695",4,"  Natalie Portman sexuality and great sci-fi visual backround and atmosphere is what only saved this film, but the annihilation can't annihilate itself"
"696",2,"  More fiction than science. More of a horror film. If you go to see wanting a science science-fiction movie you will be disappointed. It is a visual treat, a vaguely interesting thesis, not well executed."
"697",0.5,"  Really bad boring movie everybody in theater were yawning waste of money don't wantch"
"698",2,"  Flat, bleak, and lifeless. I didn't care much whether the characters lived or died. I"
"699",0.5,"  WARNING: The most terrible waste of time and money movie I have seen in a long time. There is no Plot, no connectivity to anyone in the movie, no beginning or ending. A total waste of good talented actors, they got paid, I didn't. This movie has no reason to exist, except to give untalented people a reason to believe they are talented. I won't even give it a 1/2 star, except I had to to make this warning post to unsuspecting movie goers. The acting was good, the writing ok, the plot; thin, weak, no point, no connectivity between the actors or the audience, no one cares about anything inside or outside of this movie."
"700",4,"  This is one of the most striking and visionary sci-fi films of this decade. Haunting, disturbing, and occasionally breath-taking. Visually this is one of the most unique cinematic experiences of recent memory."
"701",1,"  Awful. No logic to the plot. Jennifer Jason Leigh mutters all of her lines, most of which don't make sense anyway. The soundtrack is just noise. I haven't hated a movie like this in forever."
"702",5,"  Visually Stunning. Beautifully written. A+."
"703",1.5,"  Just a little interesting, one of those movies that loses you in the end. Lots of SJW, I guess that's why the critics gave it an 86, Falls very flat in the end, supposedly looking for a sequel....no way it's a dud. ."
"704",0.5,"  I wish I could give it no stars! I want my time and money back!"
"705",3.5,"  3.5 Star Review:Annihilation is wonderfully crafted cerebral film that transports audiences into a world that is as terrifying as it is beautiful and mesmerizing. Natalie Portman stars as Lena, whom embarks on a perilous mission with 4 other women as they venture into the ""Shimmer"" that is emanating from a lighthouse that was struck by a meteor 3 years prior. Previous missions to go in and learn about the Shimmer have resulted in failure as all who go in never come out; that is until Lena's husband does so, but not without consequences. The director of this film, Alex Garland, elegantly weaves multiple story lines together while also making a thought-provoking commentary on the nature of life, death and the formation of life itself. In my opinion, however, all the build-up turns into a dissatisfying final 20 minutes where Garland simply ended up juggling too much at once and ended up hurting the film's end. In understanding the film's end, I came to realize the final act of the movie was in fact anti-climatic even though it seemed anything but as I was watching the movie real-time. For the longest time, I thought I was watching the best film in this young 2018 but in the end, I have to give it the same score as the last film I reviewed."
"706",5,"  The film Annihilation destroyed and bent traditional movie genres with both its visual style and thematic elements. It was at times horrifyingly violent, touchingly sensual and sexual, dramatic and funny. Its themes ranged from cosmic theories of how the universe will end, Annihilation, to how life begins and changes. It was wonderful to see female protagonists fight their own external and internal demons, at times personified. Bertrand Russell, a pioneer in anti-war and anti-imperialistic thought in our modern time said, ""fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom."" Facing the extinction of all we know from a colonizing alien species, is it possible to face the fear of change, and become something else? Through allegory and metaphor, Annihilation seeks to ask us this question."
"707",4.5,"  Wow. This movie is amazing! From the visuals to the story, Annihilation is an incredibly unique film. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that some parts seemed rushed, most likely because the filmmakers had to cut portions of the film due to run time. The pacing can also be a bit slow at times. But, other than that this film is definitely worth a watch, and will leave you thinking about it after leaving the theater. This is a near-perfect sci-fi flick!"
"708",4,"  Is this movie worth seeing? That is always the main question. The answer is most definitely yes. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit more than the likes of 'Arrival"" and other recent sci-fi movies. The world within the shimmer is beautiful and mind bending, and one of my few complaints is that I wish we saw more of it. The few glimpses we get of the creatures and ecosystems within are mesmerizing and I was always wanting to see more. Maybe in a possible sequel? My other complaint is that this movie starting slow and the script was awkward and quite awful at times. The lines and acting seemed very forced and faked at the beginning, but I'd say it definitely got better as the movie went on. Dr. Ventress(Jennifer Jason Leigh) was one of my most hated characters Ive watched in a movie in many years. Her character seemed totally fake and the acting was extremely forced. Maybe she was just doing the best she could with the terrible starting script. Aside from a few flaws like those, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. The ending was superb and left you walking away with a great sense of wonder as to what really happened (not in the sense of confusion, I didnt find the plot hard to follow like a lot of people did. But just how its open to examination as to what exactly happened and what will happen). The sound effects and score were very well executed and gave me an amazing and intriguing feeling similar to witnessing/hearing ""Interstellar"" for the first time. If you're looking for a beautiful, mind bending sci-fi movie, I highly recommend this movie to you"
"709",5,"  Intelligent science fiction that fills the viewer with a sense of wonder!"
"710",4.5,"  A rare original gem in a sea of remakes and other high-budget hot garbage."
"711",3.5,"  Flagship/moviepass with Sh, R&J. 3.3.18"
"712",0.5,"  This movie doesn't explain the situation in movie well and goes back to past and present."
"713",4,"  This movie is odd. Very odd. But it's also kind of great. Natalie Portman is of course amazing as always, and the visuals in the film are quite stunning. While it's classified as a fantasy adventure flick, it also has tones of horror - with quite striking switches from a colorful world, to a dark, gritty one lurking beneath the surface. The last half an hour becomes weird af and will leave you asking lots of questions and pondering what you just witnessed, but it's well worth the watch. It's a film that I'm really glad I saw on the big screen, because I don't think a television will fully capture its essence."
"714",4.5,"  In today's age of Hollywood blockbuster films and movies that recycle overused formulas, it is rare to find films that do something new and creative. In particular, it is hard to find good science fiction films anymore, as many of the ones that do come out (Valerian, Jupiter Ascending, Transformers) are glorified, big-budget action films with lots of special effects. However, every once in a while, directors will craft something special. This has resulted in a handful of memorable sci-fi films made in the past decade. Films like Interstellar, Gravity, Arrival, and most recently Blade Runner 2049 have proved themselves as good examples of this. Alex Garland, director and writer of the excellent 2015 film Ex Machina, has made a second attempt at crafting another sci-fi masterpiece in the form of Annihilation, an attempt that, for me, is successful.Annihilation stars Natalie Portman as a cellular biologist whose husband (Oscar Isaac) suddenly returns after a year on a mysterious military operation. He falls into a coma, and they are taken to a secret facility on the edge of a large environmental disaster zone known as ""The Shimmer."" Little is known about this zone and its origin, and most things that go in never come out. Portman's character, along with a supporting cast portrayed by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny, venture into ""The Shimmer,"" discovering a strange environment with terrifying horrors, beautiful landscapes, and mutated creatures. Obviously, going into much more detail past this point would ruin the film's best attributes, which I will discuss later. Anyone who wants to know more will have to see the film themselves.The thing that makes Annihilation stand out from an increasingly large library of sci-fi films is its ability to get you thinking. Many films in the sci-fi genre, whether they be meticulously crafted masterpieces or money-seeking garbage, pose questions to their viewers. Some of these films will answer these questions without much payoff, and some will toy with you and make you ponder before finally revealing its secrets before its conclusion. However, there are a select few sci-fi films that ask questions but never answer them. Rather, they provide clues and hints to the audience that allow them to draw their own conclusions, forcing them to linger on the film's meaning for a long time. My favorite example of this last category is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is still regarded as a perfect science fiction film by many critics. Annihilation very much flows in the same vein of filmmaking as 2001. While some of the baseline questions about the film's plots are answered, its ending left me baffled, confused, and shocked. These may sound like the adjectives one would use to describe something less-than-positive. On the contrary, I was delighted. I saw Annihilation two nights ago, and I am still thinking about the questions it offers and what they mean. It is a film that demands multiple viewings, a demand that I will surely be obliged to fulfill.There are many other things about Annihilation that make it a great film. Its visual effects are superb, and they bring out the beauty (and horror) of the mysteries inside ""The Shimmer."" It also features great sound editing, which will surely creep you out, put you in awe, and give you chills many a time. If I had to pinpoint any flaws in Annihilation, they would be very small. These include some convenience in its storytelling, including one or two instances of deus ex machina. These also include a small plot detail that, even after thinking about the film for hours, still doesn't seem necessary to me. Of course, my curiosity will bring me to watch the film again, so this is something that could be reconciled. Otherwise, the film is near-perfect science fiction, and it suggests that Alex Garland still has much more to offer the film industry to satisfy nerds like myself.Annihilation stands out in a world of mediocre science fiction films, reminding me why I love to watch movies. It offers gorgeous visuals, intense thrills, and a mind-boggling ending that will make you think until your brain is tired. Alex Garland proves that he has a handle on the science fiction genre with his second round as writer/director for a film. I will certainly remember Annihilation for a long time, and I hope that other audiences will as well. Annihilation gets 4 1/2 out of 5 stars."
"715",1.5,"  Some parts of the movie were entertaining, but in the end I left the theater wondering what the hell I had just watched?.................confused!"
"716",2,"  Very disappointed for two reasons: First, the director used the time-honored techniques intended to frighten the audience; so time-honored in fact that they have become cliches in films. Secondly, the similarity to J. G. Ballard's The Crystal World and Stanislaw Lem's Solaris were too obvious for me to ignore and leaves we wondering whether the author/ director suffer from a lack of originality..Why tromp through the jungle to get to a lighthouse when you can take a boat; like duh?"
"717",4,"  DC has yet to produce a proper Swamp Thing movie, but Alex Garland's Annihilation makes a fine substitute, having beautifully dark lessons in biology, gore, trippy sci-fi, and life's meaning."
"718",5,"  This film was visually beautiful. The colors and scenery we're just wow. I was on my toes throughout the whole movie. The story was very original. In most movies I feel like I can expect what's going to happen next, but in this one the most unexpected things would happen and I loved that about it. Definitely on my list of favorites."
"719",2,"  So promising, but so disappointing."
"720",3,"  Interesting twist on science fiction thrillers. The movie explains concepts simply and depicts images beautifully. Despite a weird conclusion, it is open for interpretation and leaves watchers thinking."
"721",1,"  This was a terrible conversion of the book. The movie seems to focus on the art aspect, creating an environment of color and quality CG, but fails to provide any type of motivation to make it through another 5 minutes... For most that hadn't read any of the series, you may question what is occurring and think what's with the psychologist talking unusual... For those that read the book, missing key elements that made the book amazing are missing- even a twist on the meaning of the title Annihilation..."
"722",4.5,"  In effort to avoid spoilers I think I'll just say that overall, Annihilation offers something very different. I can imagine many won't be up for it, but it's a great trip if you open your mind to it. Exceptional cast and writing create some of the most vivid and believable characters I've ever seen. And, I especially loved the juxtaposition of such horrific concepts displayed in such aesthetically beautiful ways- literally a visual manifestation of the story's main theme."
"723",5,"  I loved it. What a crazyass film!"
"724",0.5,"  Awful movie. The pacing was excruciatingly slow. Incredibly convoluted. I felt like you needed to be high to watch it or something. Just don't waste your time. How does this have such a high review score?"
"725",2,"  ohhhhhhhhh what did I just see. I don't get it... It did not shine on so many levels. I have to stop going to movies...."
"726",0.5,"  So flawed, I?ll leave it to a future film class to count the ways."
"727",0.5,"  I am going out of my way to make sure people know how stupid and ridiculous this movie is. It tries.. oh it tries and the harder it tries the dumber it gets, I'm going to assume that everyone involved in the making of this movie lacks integrity and personal pride. Ridiculous. Pointless. Wasteful."
"728",5,"  I predict one of the best movies of 2018."
"729",5,"  As a lover of scifi... This is among my top three that I've ever seen. A mind-bending mystery that slowly unravels against a darkly beautiful and truly original interpretation of a mutated section of Earth. The story has a huge amount of heart, as do all the characters, which really tie the whole thing together. So many scifi movies are cold, distant, stylish, and devoid of feeling. Not this one. The soundtrack was perfectly paired with each scene... Simple folk guitar pickings as the troop wanders The Shimmer, as well as viscerally haunting synth layers with choral voices and strings. I just saw it for the second time and appreciated it even more. I left the theater both times with an elevated sensation in my mind; I like that this film made me not only think, but go through an actually mind-opening experience. A true art piece."
"730",0.5,"  Warning. You have to be tripping acid to understand or even begin to grasp this storyline. Once you're sufficiently altered I'm sure you'll enjoy this psychedelic trip to ""Annihilation."" In the end, all that's getting annihilated is your brain cells. While the visual effects are quite engaging I believe I have seen similar if not identical simulations on my iTunes visualizer. I'm sorry to report that this movie is nothing but a lackluster bag of cheap thrills non-existent storyline, and poor acting, all encased in a world altered by an oil-slick lens filter."
"731",4.5,"  Annihilation is an intriguing film from beginning to end. Its a movie for intelligent people who likes to challenge their minds. If you are looking for a simple plot or a fun adventure, then this movie is not for you. It is Sci-Fi, yes but its more a physiological thriller that will leave wondering for days."
"732",4.5,"  Slow but methodical. After sitting with the film after a few hours I feel like it's more metaphor than sci-fi in the aliens from another planet sence. All the performances are stellar."
"733",3,"  odd pacing and poor direction, lead to unlikable and uninspired characters. There were plenty of interesting subjects but i never was invested enough to care. By no means a terrible movie but a lot of wasted opportunity"
"734",5,"  Trippy and beautiful, with a dash of nightmare fuel... Sure, there are some clunky parts that feel like studio notes demanding more backstory, but all in all this is a movie that should be seen in a theater with a great sound system. The last 15 minutes will make this a cult classic for sure."
"735",5,"  There is some new stuff to see here. Many reviewers will claim it is a mix of Arrival, Aliens, and other films but in fact, you have not seen this movie before. There are some new ideas, and the visuals are absolutely eye popping and unlike what you've seen elsewhere. It is definitely worth seeing on the big screen, to appreciate the superb art direction and special effects which blend together beautifully. You have NOT seen this film before, it is well worth the trip."
"736",1.5,"  Rotten Tomatoes ratings have become extremely unreliable and inaccurate. The hype machine has a stranglehold on you guys lately. This was worthy of a high 50s rating at best. 2hrs where nothing happens. The characters have zero chemistry. Then something happens. That ""something"" is completely random and obnoxious. Some downright terrible CGI...I got to the movies A LOT and it was nice to have good reviews to make a decision on what to see. Then again, it's entirely possible that people have extremely poor taste. Sorry to everyone who worked hard on this as I highly respect their abilities and prior works. Arrival was a genius film. As for this one save your money and time on this one. Don't even bother renting it."
"737",4,"  I was really surprised by Annihilation. It's a sci-fi/horror/thriller. It's equally weird, intriguing, and unsettling. Basically, what Prometheus should have been.One of the most visually unique films I've seen. There is so much memorable imagery, beautiful, creepy, and sometimes both at once. The whole film has a unique style that I dig. The lightning has a sunsetsey 70's feel to it. Rather than a traditional score, a good portion of the music goes for a folksy style, which actually meshes very well with the swampland the characters are trekking through.I've heard complaints that the film is too slow. Personally, it went fine with me. I don't think there were any scenes they could've cut. However, some of the dialogue does slow things down sometimes. It's very deliberate and intellectual -ish and doesn't always sound natural. Though this mostly occurs in the opening chapter where all the exposition comes from. (Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is especially a bit of a boring chore to get through in beginning. Can't tell if it's the dialogue, her acting, or a bit of both.)"
"738",4.5,"  Love the scientific concept of the movie. Keeps you guessing until the very last scene. Leaves me wanting more. Annihilation 2?"
"739",0.5,"  This movie was weird and sucked. Natalie Portman is hot though."
"740",4,"  Invasion of the Padme snatchers."
"741",0.5,"  Wish someone annialated this movie before I paid $15 bucks to see it. I want to start a movement so people can get a refund for crappy movies like this."
"742",4.5,"  While this didn't necessarily ""blow my mind"" in any way as some have experienced, I still have nothing but great things to say about 'Annihilation'. Filled with original ideas, terrific scares, and excellent performances this is a stunner of the science fiction drama, which only so rarely gets something this fresh and intriguing. Whatever Alex Garland is eating for breakfast every day don't let him stop!"
"743",5,"  Alex Garland's sophomore film is nothing short of perfect. The visuals in this high-concept sci-fi horror film in conjunction with the performances given by the exceptionally talented women in it are only two of reasons this film is destined to be a classic."
"744",5,"  Huh ? 21 pages of reviews but only $11 mill at the box office so far. If you want pap go see Star Wars . I just got my Sci Fi fix."
"745",5,"  Solid Sci Fi, mostly female cast that doesn't feel forced, can be a bit slow. But brilliant all around."
"746",4,"  A smart, provocative sci-fi gem that digs deeply into the issue of how humanity is based on self-destruction. Several good scares, cool visuals and some really deep thoughts on what could potentially be the end of human kind."
"747",0.5,"  This movie is profoundly terrible. You have been warned.Annihilation is at best a straight to video B movie.People will tell you that the visuals a great. No it is standard CGI farePeople will tell you that the score is great. No it is completely forgetableThe plot and characters are so stupid that you have to wonder how the screen play was approved. There were no deep scientific questions, there was no profound meaning. Basically the movie throws a bunch of incoherent nonsense at you and hopes you will be fooled into thinking it is profound."
"748",2,"  It was ok. The movie was interesting and suspenseful, but it falls flat at the end. It keeps you guessing at what is going on. Then it ends and you are still not sure. The so called science of the movie doesn't make sense and there. There are a lot of holes in the logic."
"749",3,"  This one is WAY out there. I guess it was entertaining if this is your first exposure to the story. I just think it was a little to ""heady"" to make for a good movie. Still a fun watch though."
"750",5,"  Annihilation is at once intelligent, horrifying, beautiful, emotionally resonant and deeply thought-provoking - all the hallmarks of great science fiction.If you happen to be in Canada, China, or the US, go see it on the big screen!"
"751",5,"  The cinematography is beautiful. The story is told in a way that allows the viewer's imagination to explore purposeful gaps in the narrative, and the writing and story-telling is successfully non-patronizing."
"752",5,"  After over ten years of not caring enough to make an account on here, I made a Rotten tomatoes account to give this movie 5 stars. It's likely the only review I will ever write on Rottenness tomstoes. This movie is, almost exclusively, perfect. Incredibly intelligent, almost too intelligent in some ways. I didn't have my interpretation figured out until the morning after watching, which I love. I love that I can't stop thinking about it. Everything is so intelligently executed and designed, it's the science fiction movie I didn't think I deserved but so desperately wanted."
"753",5,"  Best Sci-fi movie I have seen in quite a few years. Visually stunning and the score is simply captivating ( the song ""Alien"" could tell a story just with sound, it's awesome). Love the deeper meaning that sometimes things have no meaning or purpose - the world just keeps changing, not for the better or for the worse, but for the ""different"". Overall, I love it ;made me create a rotten tomatoes account for heaven's sake!"
"754",5,"  A phenomenal depiction of the very real psychological struggles that the cast encounters when confronted with something so beyond our understanding. Their search for answers through this beautiful, yet hostile anomaly leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout the duration of the film. Alex Garland delivers a true spectacle that defy's modern trends on what science fiction is."
"755",2,"  No doubt this film is full of visual effects, but the story and pace lagged considerably. I am sure there is technical merit; however, the film itself seemed bland and often unnecessarily puzzling."
"756",3,"  good scifi worth watching"
"757",0.5,"  Totally sucked. No rhyme or reason."
"758",5,"  It's a very neat movie. None of the scenes is dispensable."
"759",4,"  This is an amazingly fresh and different take on a sci-fi movie. Well worth seeing if you like horror and thought provoking movies. It doesn't follow the average formula for such a movie and the ending will really make you think. It's not just a 'last person standing' type of film and I really enjoyed it."
"760",5,"  I loved it. It's moody and weird much of the time, but that's fine with me. Some very intense scenes."
"761",4,"  Between a 7/10 and 8/10, Annihilation is some heady nightmare fuel, but its most striking quality may be how little it has in common with the current trends in mainstream science fiction."
"762",0.5,"  THIS WAS A FANTastic sci-fi premise, but was unfortunates poorly executed by all parties. The direction seemed completely absent. The script was an embarrassing amateur hour of clunky exposition, unmotivated outbursts, and bland characters. I didn't care about any of the characters. They were so generic and poorly drawn. Natalie Portman gave the worst performance of her career. IT wasn't WAS truly awful. THe only one of the female scientist that seemed to Ben able to emote and show even a little depth was the very minor character of the physicist. All of the big parts, from the older woman to the fake hot-tempered one, were just outlines. It was like a boy band - she's the hot one, she's the smart one, she's the badass, she the sensitive one. In addition to these faults, the movie was long and slow and quiet. The CGI was amateur as well. The story after the premise wasn't laid out was hard to follow. There were plot holes everywhere. There were unmotivated actions and responses that were no credible. This was a terrible waste of time. But it was inspiring. If something this bad can attract a star and wide release, anybody can make a movie."
"763",5,"  Awesome movie! Will be going back for a second time to pick up on stuff that I missed the first run through. Mind blowing movie with so many layers. Nice to see a good cerebral sci-fi movie come out."
"764",4.5,"  if Apocalypse Now and Arival had a baby, that Stanley Kubrick directed, this would be that movie. Its very open to interpretation of what makes you... well you.. and at what point do you cease to be that idea of self. Its somewhere between arthouse and intellectual sci-fi. I am sure there will be psychology courses that cover the topics this movie approaches. There is so much to unpack, even after the movie is over."
"765",3.5,"  I loved Ex Machina, so of course wanted to see Alex Garland's new movie. There were some great visuals and it was scary, creepy, sometimes beautiful, but where Ex Machina had moments where the characters were having fun this movie is dour throughout. There are mysteries here, sure, but the ending fits into the idea that being ambiguous means the movie is good and ""thought-provoking."" Honestly, considering how the rest of the movie went, I'd be more surprised if the ending WAS clear. Especially since after Ex Machina, ambiguity is expected.I'll give three and a half stars because there are some truly striking visuals throughout, but the movie seems far too in love with its bleakness to be a classic."
"766",5,"  I think a good chunk of viewers did not fully comprehend this film. Annihilation is not just a movie, it's an experience. It's full of meaning those at the surface need to grasp. I came in expecting a sci-fi thriller, but I left with something more. Annihilation presents us with stunning visuals and entrancing music. As big of a fever dream as it feels, I think that was the point. To make it so bizarre that only those who dipped below the surface would be able to understand. This movie may look like nothing but nonsense to some, but to me, it was a work of art. The characters, the plot, the visuals, the score, the concepts. Each and every part of it was magnificent, and I'd definitely see it again."
"767",4.5,"  To critique the film without mentioning the word ""psychedelic"" would be disingenuous. The slow-burn, intensely-cerebral nature of the film embodies everything that the psychedelic experience can radiate. Striking aural immersion, jaw-dropping visuals, shades of terror, and seemingly infinite perplexity deliver thrills and nuance that subvert modern tropes existing in the majority of science fiction and horror films today. Annihilation serves far more as an experience that raises questions about the nature of the human psyche and biology than concrete ideology. An experience that echoes long after it is over."
"768",5,"  This film should be one of the highest rated of the past decade. It's part of a Science Fiction reawakening in the past few years that includes masterpieces like Arrival, Ex Machina, Blade Runner 2049, and Moon if you want to reach back that far. It's films like this that point out the flaws of rating sites like Rotten Tomatoes. While it certainly deserves a higher critic score it's the audience score that's truly disheartening."
"769",5,"  wow, crazy, awesome , just wow"
"770",5,"  Different concept. A definite mind bender. An original new idea and far from a remake of any other movie like itself. It was great to see a new idea and not the same old movie that gets remade every few years."
"771",5,"  An amazing, terrifying and wondrous and sometimes psychedelic foray into science fiction. Deviates in many ways from Vandermeer's trilogy yet somehow remains true to it in all of its nihilistic beauty."
"772",3,"  The movie kept me interested for sure - with some mystery, some suspense and the leading lady. It was interesting to see what the whole thing was about and I am not sure I exactly know. I did not ponder so much as just think it was a good movie and enjoyed it. Some may not be as easy going about no firm answers."
"773",5,"  This is a unique, tense, and awe-inspiring movie. It's probably not for everyone as it really doesn't try to entertain but for fans of sci-fi and high-quality filmmaking, I think this is one of the best in a while. With Ex Machina and now this Garland is quickly becoming one of the most exciting filmmakers working today."
"774",0.5,"  Too much to process! No clear direction...didn't make sense in the end"
"775",5,"  Awesome movie. Great action in really scary parts. The best part is the mystery. Im still in a mind-func trying to figure out what is what."
"776",3.5,"  Artfully ambiguous .....with an all female team going in to figure out the 'Shimmer', maybe I was hoping for a bit more action...and story...I enjoyed it...it was ok....definitely for the science minded!! :-)"
"777",3,"  Annihilation has some engaging ideas and beautiful scenery but leaves you with more questions than answers."
"778",1.5,"  Awful movie slow just a really boring movie"
"779",5,"  Much better than I expected. It is not Ex Machina (which I loved) and that is a good thing and it is not Arrival (which I liked) and that is also a good thing. It was unique and kept my interest to the very end."
"780",0.5,"  This movie is really boring and not worth the money to watch and will waste your time."
"781",1,"  Pretty lame science fiction. Nothing makes sense from a plot perspective. What they do or why they are doing it. Send in the drones with fiber optic cable."
"782",4,"  fun & weird & fairly suspensful. should have gone a bit grosser w mutations/human or murderous doubles to make it CRAZY. Original screen ending w meteors sounded better."
"783",1,"  now way. these critics must of been relatives. So many blank spots and story does not lead you anyplace but confused."
"784",5,"  A mind-blowing, sophisticated sci-fi tale masterfully brought to the screen by director Alex Garland, who has upped his game considerably here, even outstripping the success of his previous work, ""Ex Machina."" The film's richly layered, deftly nuanced, insightful script, combined with gorgeous cinematography and an inventive production design, make for riveting viewing. Note, however, that this is not a picture to be watched casually or when one is easily distracted. But an attentive screening is sure to captivate, providing much to think about in terms of metaphysics, spirituality, existence and evolution -- and possibly forever changing one's views on these heady subjects."
"785",5,"  Beautiful film. Enjoyed it more than I did Black Panther. I dont have a single bad thing to say about it. Great score, story development, CGI, amazing performances. 8/10 in my book."
"786",2.5,"  The premise of a meteor bringing the ""things"" that you'll learn of during the movie was difficult enough to swallow. Then they pile on ultimately unexplained weirdities that left me weary and unsatisfied."
"787",1.5,"  Yuk: boring, unsatisfying. Portman is excellent with the stuff she had to work with."
"788",2.5,"  Remember when alien movies were just about little green men or robot humanoids coming to conquer Earth? Annihilation is another in a long line of modern sci-fi films to be more interested in the philosophy than the practicality of extra-terrestrials. But unlike Under the Skin or Europa Report, its ponderous nature never quite reaches its point. It's definitely a metaphor for something, but what? Aging? Marriage? Dementia? Time? Death? Perhaps a second-viewing would clear some of this up, but then I'd have to slog through this movie again.An unknown object has crashed onto earth, causing a slowly growing ""shimmer"" wall that seems to make anyone who enters it disappear. In so many ways, it's just a lesser version of classic films. Like Tarkovsky's Stalker, it's comfortable with saying ""I don't know"", but more out of confusion than intrigue. Like Villeneuve's Arrival, it uses alien beings to talk about humanity, but with little emotional impact. Like Carpenters' The Thing, its unexpectedly and brutally gory, though not as technically impressive.However, it's a hard movie to write-off or be complacent about, given its strangeness and ambition. The bursts of horror are fun and unique, with cool creatures and a steady directing hand. Most of all, it's visually striking cinematography and often quite beautiful production design are undeniable. Most of its issues seem to stem from the writing, which isn't just thematically unfocused, but also just full of cliched dialogue. With Ex Machina, Alex Garland made a strong impression with that debut. And even with all of Annihilation's script problems, his camera's eye and brainy tendencies keep him as a filmmaker worth watching."
"789",5,"  Officially my all-time favorite movie. Truly incredible and the epitome of feminism. So impressed by Natalie Portman!"
"790",2,"  SLOW, poor casting, not compelling or believable at all. ONLY slightly interesting feature is the visual effects and ending. Conspiracy giving it high marks... Just plain boring and I almost walked out....everyone in our theatre agreed"
"791",1,"  This was the worst sci-fi movie I have seen in many years. In a word, ludicrous."
"792",5,"  Annihilation is directed by Alex Garland, and is based off of a massively successful novel by Jeff VanderMeer. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and having finally seen it, I am blown away. Annihilation is incredible. Alex Garland had already knocked it out of the park with Ex Machina, and Annihilation is even better. This is full on 2001 style insanity, and it is glorious. Everything about this movie is so finely crafted and carefully constructed that the finished product is like almost nothing i've ever seen. The performances are all exceptional, especially from Natalie Portman. She has a lot of difficult work do, and she handles it with such a resolve. The standout in the film, is how it looks. Alex Garland has crafted a visual wonder. Then comes the end. No spoilers, but the final 20 minutes of the film are so insane, that the only thing I can compare it to is the ending of 2001. This movie also has one of the scariest scenes of the decade so far. Again no spoilers, but the way tension is created is masterful. Honestly, 2018 is gonna have to try really hard to give me a movie that is better than Annihilation."
"793",3.5,"  SPOILER ALERTI found the ending of the movie to be rather an upbeat one.Each of the woman scientists, Lena, Ventress, Josie, Anya, Cass, have a serious fault in their lives.Lena a cheater, Ventresss, sick with cancer, Cass - loss of a child, but we never find out how (was it her fault?), Josie, cutting herself (to feel alive, or feel something, why?) and Anya a recovering addict. They are seriously injured either mentally, or in in Ventress and Josie's case, physically. Are they looking for an answer to the shimmer, or are they looking for an anwer to what they perceive to be their shitty, hopeless, closed off lives. Lena buries herself in her work to forget that she probably dorve her husband into a dangerous situation. They are looking for CHANGE, and that is what the shimmer is - CHANGE, for good or bad, but it definately changes people. It changes everything on earth to be bigger (the alligator), brighter (all the flowers), for better or worse.It is also more dangerous, so with change comes danger. The shimmer is a metaphor for our earth changing and we as humans are changing with it, some get cancer from its toxins, some can't go on because of a loss in our lives. The shimmer is the HOPE for a change to make our lives better. Our human cells change and intermingle with that of the shimmer. From the opening scene the movie is all about cell division like cancer changing, doubling forever increasing and going on, isn't that what the shimmer will do if it isn't stopped. But it is stopped, or is it. Maybe the shimmer is like cancer changing and mutating into something else and is immortality in its very nature. Maybe the shimer itself adapted and changed into something else inside Lena and Kane. Don't forget Lena tested her blood and it had changed, so she was already different before she went to the lighthouse. Who was it that left the lighthuse at the end, was it Lena or her double. It doesn't really matter because the ending, when she meets her husband (who has already changed and can't drink the life blood of earth - water) they embrace, intermingling who and what they are into something new, (just like in the shimmer when you touched something it changed your structure). This is perhaps a new beginning for their life together. One where they maybe don't remember that Lena cheated and that Kane ran away. To me it was a hopeful ending, the shimmer was burned away for new things to begin, just like a forest fire spurs new growth. Maybe it isn't too late for earth and the humans on it to recover, but we must realize it soon, or the shimmer will take over."
"794",3.5,"  I enjoyed 95% of the film, and 75% of it was quite gripping. It was visually stimulating and unique, and well acted -- but underdeveloped characters and odd special effects stop this from being an award winner. [3.5 stars]"
"795",5,"  There were some things from the book that i wish were preserved in the movie... but overall the movie was its own beast and was definitely worth watching!"
"796",0.5,"  If I could give it zero stars, I would. Pure garbage. A nothing ending where absolutely zero closure. Full of plot holes and loose ends. Natalie Portman's worst job of her career. An affair in the middle of the movie has nothing to do with anything in the plot. So mad we paid money for this and wasted two hours of our life."
"797",4.5,"  Such a good sci-fi horror flick with stunningly beautiful images of mutations. Plus an A+ cast of leading women who brave going into the shimmer for a mission when no one has ever come back from that. It was well worth seeing and I wouldn't mind seeing it again."
"798",5,"  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Wow! Who imagined this story? Someone with an incredible imagination, love movies where the story line could very well be a possibility. Go see it!!!"
"799",1.5,"  Kept waiting for the movie to begin, and then it was over"
"800",4,"  There are parts of the movie where the silliness can be more perceived than its overall thematic statements, but then it goes into directions that become intricately fascinating. It's sad that this film is mostly marketed as a dumb popcorn action flick as it's more along the lines of Kubrick and Tarkovsky."
"801",4,"  Fantastic movie that surprised me at every turn and left my jaw open for the last 20 minutes. Highly recommend!"
"802",5,"  *First things first. Annihilation is one of those types of movies that if you don't pay attention and just focus on getting action sequences, you will not understand the movie by the ending. Every word that is said in this movie from start to end is important and will hook you in from the beginning even before they enter the ""Shimmer"".*Alright now to the review. Like I said, once the movie started, I knew that this movie would focus more on story than just pure action, so I knew to pay attention to the dialogue. Once I did, this movie went from what seemed like an unoriginal plot at first to the most original movies I had ever seen at the theater in a way that will shock you in many ways those scenes deliver. It wasn't emotional to me, but beautiful,creepy, and intense all at the same time. Annihilation is worth the buck if you love these Suspenseful Thriller types of movies."
"803",3,"  This second outing for Director Alex Garland stars Natalie Portman alongside a kick-ass, all-female cast. It revolves around Portman's character after the mysterious return of her thought to be dead husband (Oscar Isaac). And her journey into the mysterious and unknown ""shimmer,"" where he was assumed to be K.I.A., in order to find a cure for his failing health. The film is as beautiful as it is frightening. Garland's pace throughout the film has you unsure of what to fully expect and has you questioning what might be around the next corner. It captures a wonderfully twisted and nightmarish quality to it. Thinking back- having watched it twice in a row. It feels like a half-remembered dream. Which is pretty high praise considering that's what supposed to happen when people go into the shimmer. And yet, as the film progresses, it's pacing becomes to feel more sluggish than intoxicating. The more we know turns out to be the less we know. And it may become a frustrating task figuring out what the movie doesn't want to spoil for you. Garland chooses to let go of explaining too much, and yet the film still manages to back itself into some plot holes. But what the directore does instead is rely on fleshing out characters. Thaaaaat ultimately feel as though they might be better off dead. Ugh! Still though, if you leave yourself open to follow along and enjoy the ride, you're treated to some of the most bizarre and refreshing moments to be had in a theatre (Or on Netflix) in a long time. Only you can say whether it scores or if get's lost in the end zone. That's entirely up to your interpretation of what happens... in the shimmer. *ooOOOoo*3 stars"
"804",5,"  only 66% like the movie... probably because they dont understand any of it"
"805",4.5,"  Annihilation is very complex and mysterious movie, but one of the best looking and interesting science fiction movies in a while. The movie follows a group of scientists into ""The Shimmer"", which is a secret quarantined zone home to many weird and suspicious activities. The group is all female, led by Natalie Portman, who puts in an outstanding performance as Lena. The supporting cast is also strong, with each playing their unique roles well. Oscar Isaac in particular is a standout in his flashback sequences with Natalie Portman, as both have strong on screen chemistry. Although the mystery of the film slowly unfolds, the pacing can be a little off at times. However, the movie does take time to get to know the character's backstories and explaining some of the complex and mysterious events and mutating creatures. There are some gruesome scenes that may discomfort some members of the audience, but they add to the intensity and mystery of the world. The third act is when everything finally gets explained and the backstory comes together. There is a lot of controversy over this final sequence and the ending. However, I believe it was well done and highlights the cinematography and creativity of the movie perfectly. Overall, Annihilation has some pacing problems in the second act and ""The Shimmer"" can seem very complex at times, but these minor flaws are overshadowed by standout performances (particularly Natalie Portman), beautiful visuals, and a very interesting science fiction story."
"806",4,"  Thought-provoking with a touch of horror."
"807",1.5,"  Simply confusing and terrible. Plus, who made those falte visual effects? I hope they don't get paid."
"808",2,"  Horrible movie. It was strange and not realistic. Very inconsistent. When something mirrors you then everything you do should be mirrored....parts. mirrored but in a delayed reaction. Someone was trippin' when they made this. Someone trained in combat just doesnt carelessly walk into a village, post or area without caution. Several people walked out laughing at how bad it was."
"809",3.5,"  If you like movies like 2001, Solaris, and Under the Skin you should like this movie. I enjoyed it a lot. The music score was phenomenal. That is something that has really stuck with me. Only complaint I have is that a lot of big moment scenes in the movie were shown in the trailer, but there is still a big surprise for the final scene."
"810",1,"  Sorry but I had high hopes for this movie but it was slow going...lost any respect for the main character because of infidelity and the ending was seriously...WTF!!!!"
"811",2.5,"  Some of the acting was subpar. The psychologist made NO sense. The ending??????????????? Whatever!"
"812",5,"  This is a very good movie, well made, well acted."
"813",1.5,"  *****SPOILER ALERT******Annihilation ruined rainbows for me, maybe for everyone. Natalie Portman's acting couldn't save the sloppy, lazy script. The film beats the viewer over its head with the concept of cell duplication to the point it becomes insulting. They managed to put man-bear-pig in a serious sci-fi film with an anti-climatic demise to the heroine soldier. Rainbows. The visual effects were often shameful, the tracking was constantly off and they didn't bother to animate the deer so they would move independently as they naturally would. At times I could see where the matte painting stopped and the set started. People turn into flowers (which could've been beautiful and more meaningful if done well and shown). Rainbows. They turned aliens into a cheap fashion show. Rainbows. An awkward emotional alien-rape scene. Some of the acting was cringe-worthy, though the script definitely was the primary reason it came across as forced. Did I mention rainbow flares? They even put them in night scenes! They're so overused you can't even make a drinking game out of it. Also, why did they have to show Natalie Portman cheating on her husband and antagonize her with no resolution whatsoever. In the end, Alex will wish making this 40 million dollar extravaganza was a bad mushroom trip, though he may never come down. Rainbows."
"814",1,"  This movie SUCKS. I love sci fi and horror and this movie is a bloated, over-rated, badly acted piece of garbage. I normally don't comment on movies online but went out of my way to let people know about this. The fact that so many top critics praised really makes me question the whole system."
"815",2,"  I thought the movie lacked a credible ending and the explanation for the characters actions was questionable.,"
"816",4,"  This visually sumptuous sci-fi thriller offers some nightmarish moments you won't soon forget. Natalie Portman is at the top of her game as a biologist, scholar, ex-soldier who searches for answers to some very big questions. One of the best films in this genre in recent years featuring five strong female characters. Bravissima!"
"817",4.5,"  Once again, I have to reinforce how much I love original science fiction films. Yes, Alex Garland apparently took some liberties with the source material, but the feeling I had watching Annihilation was unlike anything I have had in quite some time, perhaps since seeing Interstellar in 2014. The wide range of tone and emotion this movie can display is unbelievable. I went from being invested in the intellectual elements of this sci-fi feature, to beyond terrified of the creatures that inhabit ""The Shimmer"", to fascinated by the mind-blowing choices the film makes in the third act. In every sense, Annihilation is a unique piece of art.The main story thread sees Natalie Portman's 'Lena' team with Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), and Josie (Tessa Thompson) in an attempt to figure out why no human life form seems to come back after visiting The Shimmer. It's both a science fiction adventure film, as well as a psychological horror/thriller. All genres are equally as compelling to see play out here.While it can be a slow moving film at times, its methodical pace plays into the epicness of the ending in my opinion. You may not be as impressed or as shocked by the events of the third act if you don't get a confusingly plodding first hour and a half. And I say that in the most affectionate way possible. I don't like building up the suspense or anticipation for a film to people who haven't seen it, but it's worth noting that I'm still buzzing after it's been 5 days.There's no sense in trying to explain some of the events of the film or what it means, considering I myself am still trying to figure out beat for beat, and it's better to go into this film completely blind, as I mostly did. However, I can say that the performances (by an all female lead cast) are terrific, the special and practical effects are terrifying and beautiful, and the direction is brave. From a science fiction perspective, you can't really ask for any more than that.9.5/10"
"818",5,"  A brilliant beautiful and dark sci-fi film from Ex-Machina Director. A must see in theaters."
"819",1,"  Oh, Dear..where to start... This is one of the most uninspired, utterly boring, slower than a turtle's crawl, stale, unimaginative, thought- not-provoking movie I have ever witnessed . Although most of the critics and the self-proclaimed ""deep thinkers"" giving this movie 5 stars would make you believe, this movie is a gloomy pile of self-pitty, stupidity, and nonsense designed for deeply depressed people who find joy in observing other equally depressed individuals portrayed on the big screen. And yes, some of you are right in stating that this movie is not for the mass audiences who would not be able to comprehend its illogical and pointless plot..It is made for those rare individuals with below average intelligence who are actually unable to think and ask questions but rather are willing to accept a few scientific words and conceptions thrown at them, a few weird scenes with creepy creatures and a few wooden characters at face value precisely because they do not understand anything that's going on but desperately want to fit with the smarter crowd. So lets examine the so called ""brilliant premises"" of the movie which seem to grasp the attention of the ""deep thinkers"". The idea of self destruction was introduced in the movie, as the psychologist said ""we all drink and smoke""...WOW self-destructing ourselves must be the idea of the century for these poor souls. What incredible imagination!!! Next is the scientific notion about programmed cell death- WOW has anyone heard about apoptosis, or the programmed cell death before? Obviously the intelligent ""deep thinkers"" haven't? What about Freud;s death instinct? Nope, never heard of it- go check it on google ""deep thinkers"". Actually the only interesting notion in the movie was the idea that cell were initially created to divide perpetually and they eventually stop dividing due to a faulty gene( not a new idea but interesting). Now let's talk about how slow paced and infuriatingly one toned this movie is. I don't know about you ""deep thinkers"" maybe you need more time to process things but I personally prefer when someone is talking to me to not pause for 1 minute between sentences and stare at me for another minute before he continues with the next torturous sentence. Yea, believe it or not I am that fast thinking, I can comprehend a whole speech without 1 minute pauses between each sentence. The sound, music and CGI effects are equally terrible - if want to imagine how the Shimmer looks, just go to the park, blow a soap bubble and Voila you will see the Shimmer through it.Now let's get down to the plot. There is this phenomenon happening at a local park that keeps enlarging and engulfing more territory. The government has sent multiple expeditions and drones but nobody comes back except one soldier who happens to be Natalie Portman's husband. He comes back to the house after 12 months absence, acting weird and out of character, then he starts throwing up blood. Natalie takes him to the hospital and they get ambushed by some special forces. Basically Natalie who is a professor of cellular biology wakes up and finds out about the Shimmer so she decides to join a team of psychologist, paramedic, physicist and another person to explore the Shimmer. Why would they go in after so many have failed without any clear plan of what they are going to do is mind-blowing on its own. But hey, let's not get to picky and try to find a reason or a plot in this mindless endeavor. So they go in and wake up with amnesia which seems to last only for the first few days, after that they remember everything even enough to recount the events when the last survivor Natalie comes out of the Shimmer. So the physicist gets pulled by a giant alligator into the water and stays there for s couple of minutes but comes out ...wait for it miraculously without a scratch. How is that possible when she should have come out without half her limbs you ask yourself- well let the ""deep thinkers"" figure it out, I am sure they will come up with something. So the big idea is that when you get into the Shimmer the thing/alien creature deconstructs your DNA - how exactly deconstructs it , is their a pattern, how does it choose to turn some people into glooming trees and blow up deconstruct others to their basic molecules(the psychologist's fate) is not explained or reasoned with at all. But, hey let's not forget this movie is not made for people who want to know, it is made for these rare ""deep thinkers"" who don't need to know or find reason or logic - like people on crack. So, one by one the explorers all get killed except Natalie who gets to the light house (the supposed home of the creature). By a drop of her blood the alien recreates this silver human looking being who starts to copy Natalie's every move. So, we watch her slow dance with this creature for a bit without any attempt on her part to understand it or try to talk to it, find its reasons for being on Earth..I mean didn't she just go in their to find out what is going on??? Instead she decides to give the alien a bomb and for another unknown reason the alien decided to pull the trigger and blow him/herself. Great ending right? When Natalie is questioned by the government people what did the creature want she says after a good minute or two of staring and thinking ""I don't know"".. Right, then why did you go in in the first place, dear? What the alien deconstructed your DNA and thinking to such a degree that it made you lose all purpose...And of course the end is mind blowing- the shimmer is gone, but now Natalie and her husband Kane (who is not her real husband any more but the alien) are possessed. Wow what a brilliant end for the ""deep thinkers"" For the rest of us intelligent people with sense of logic this movie is pure nonsensical trash, and uninspired at that."
"820",1,"  I loved Ex Machina, I think Natalie Portman is great, but this movie's a dud. Sluggish, senseless puree of half-baked themes and ideas. Plus the science makes no sense."
"821",4.5,"  From writer and director Alex Garland, Annihilation is about a team of researchers who go into this unknown zone that has appeared called 'The Shimmer' to investigate what it is, why it's here, and how it's growing and changing its surroundings so rapidly. I was a fan of Garland's last film he wrote and directed, Ex Machina, for his tightly written dialogue and mesmerizing scene development with great acting and a surprising amount of action as well. His work on that film transfers over beautifully to Annihilation with a substantially bigger budget and a wider variety of acting as well. Even though this script has substantially less dialogue than his last film, each and every line is executed beautifully and the audience feels the impact of every one as well. His direction in this movie is flawless with the proper use of slow motion and the mix of special effects and practical makes it mesmerizing every second the cast is in the shimmer. Like I said the dialogue is practically flawless with it's variety of characters and unique builds in this film. The twists written come across very well and are fleshed out beautifully with its amazing cast and great direction. Rob Hardy's work on cinematography is amazing with his offsetting shots and beautifully crafted scenes. With him working on Ex Machina with Garland they have now developed a system that is just pumping out more and more beautiful movies every few years now. Acting wise everyone did a flawless job in this film. Natalie Portman I believe has never done a bad or even a decent performance, when she hits the screen she's impeccable with every role, every character, every scene, every line of dialogue that she executes in every film she's in. Jennifer Jason Leigh did an amazing job once again as Dr. Ventress in this film, I grew a very big liking for her from her performance in The Hateful Eight. Even Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson did amazing jobs for their polar-opposite characters in this film. One of the biggest parts of this film is the make p done on the cast and it's by far the best looking makeup of the year. The scars on characters and tattoos being strategically placed on the characters makes this films story just more and more impactful with every watch. The blood and gore used is beautiful combined with great prosthetics and for gore and creatures as well. Annihilation I believe will be one of the best sleeper movies of the year with it's highly original sci-fi story and great direction and acting with a flawless blend of CGI and practical effects used. My only complaint has to be a subplot that attempts to flesh out Portman's character a bit more, I felt it's not necessary and drags the runtime out a little bit too long. Minus that it's a near perfect sci-fi movie. I have to give this film a 9.25/10"
"822",4.5,"  this movie is fantastic, at least for those that want sci fi movies with strong plots that forces you to think. good shocks,and a very interesting plot"
"823",4.5,"  Super interesting, and great jump scares and regular scares!"
"824",4.5,"  Liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Impressive visual effects, as well as great acting. The end of the movie has one of the trippiest sequences I have ever seen, and will leave you with so many questions at the end. Definitely worth seeing."
"825",0.5,"  Poor Movie not worth seeing"
"826",1,"  stupid waste of money."
"827",4,"  Annihilation is thinking persons sci-fi in the vein of 2016's fantastic Arrival. If it's a little too far fetched at times and perhaps not quite as emotional as Villeneuve's film, Annihilation is still powerful and its unique story and themes will offer up major food for thought for cerebral minded audiences. The film also benefits from terrific performances and gorgeous visuals, establishing a thoroughly dreamlike quality to the atmosphere. Alex Garland also punctuates his film with moments of sheer terror and beauty, alternating between terrifying monster battles and serene natural beauty. It all culminates in a dazzling and mind-opening climax that rivets and confuses. This is where the film could lose many viewers, but Garland is bold and ballsy and commits wholeheartedly. While watching the final ten minutes I was awestruck and tense, helped greatly by the moody score by Ben Salisbury, and even if I didn't quite grasp what the film was saying in these moments, I left the theater recreating and puzzling the pieces together. Audiences may vary in their interpretations, although similar themes will arise in most interpretations. Garland has here created a sci-fi film of human folly and self-destruction and visualizes this in the most extreme, metaphorical way. It is highly intriguing filmmaking, perhaps not fully satisfying but riveting and after Ex Machina, proves Garland is one to watch in this field. Rating: 84"
"828",3.5,"  It is definitely a beautiful movie the CGI is quite the spectacle but I felt the overall project shot the moon and fell short. Big ideas felt muddled and the ending was a letdown. The cast was forgettable as well, for a small team like that I need to feel for their safety but I didn't really care. Still it was a good attempt that was enjoyable enough, just doesn't reach the grand height of Alex Garland's Ex Machina."
"829",4,"  Pros: Natalie Portman really digs down and brings out emotions in herself and in the audience. Her character is immediately painted as damaged by her husbands death but her own misdeeds show who she is at her base. The visuals of the shimmer quickly go from beautiful and pleasing to intense and creepy. Very eye pleasing to the audience without taking too much from the story or trying too hard.Multiple scenes had me constantly moving from the edge of my seat to cowering from the intensity. Cons: The beginning was important to character building but the movie seemed to use some time building characters that should have been put into the ending. It seemed almost a little rushed and it creates more questions then answers (possibly by design)."
"830",1.5,"  If you've read the amazing trilogy that this movie is supposed based on, you will be sorely disappointed. I've never seen a movie less faithful to the novels than this one, and it wasn't in a good way. They turned a creepy psychological thriller into a Rambo-with-monsters movie with a happy-ish ending. The movie was missing basically everything that made the books great - (SPOILERS) the tower, the crawler, the psychologist's hypnosis, the way everyone was named by their profession, the journals in the lighthouse, the biologist's lack of connection to humanity, the mutant in the marsh, and the lighthouse keeper. Ouch!What a disappointment to fans of the books."
"831",2,"  The beginning was way too long, I mean we get it she's in love with her husband. I was expecting to see more animals with mutations, didn't! Cut out all the b******* in the movie it would have ran about an hour. I do not suggest going to see this in the theater. Maybe, I mean maybe, if you're bored and all your laundry is done in your dishes are done you have absolutely nothing to do and the choice is kill yourself or watch the movie, well watch the movie."
"832",4.5,"  what an absolute beauty of a movie, any movie that grabs and holds my interest is one thing, but to have me thinking about it after and days to come deserves some serious respectAlex Garland is without doubt my favorite director, dating back to a couple of my favorite movies 28days Later, The Beach, Sunshine and ExMachina Garland is an absolute genius with his directing and story tellingthis movie is for open minds, people who think about the world and life for what it offers. this movie was so intense and mind-boggling at every second. SPOILER: that bear creature with the voice! oh wow, how creepy and genius. music was so perfectly done as well in the final climax."
"833",3,"  This was an entertaining movie. It had a bear attack scene like the leonardo decapricated movie , only freakier!! As a sci-fi movie, it had had some trippy concepts, that I am still trying to decide if they are nonsensical or not. As a sci-fi movie it is heavier on the fi, than the sci. The sci part is explained simply by one of the characters as ""refractions."" hmmm, bs basically, but in a real life situation, bs is probably all that would be available to explain a situation such as this without decades of government funded research. Overall, not really much of a resolution , , an entertaining movie. It gets the third star for the awesome soundtrack."
"834",2,"  Nothing much to ponder after watching, other than wondering if I saw the same movie as so many critics who rejoiced in it did. 3/4 of the film was a cheaply done typical Scifi/ monster flick. A lack luster attempt at connecting with the five women as each of their stories are revealed, comes out short and unconvincingly. The last 1/4 had some cool visuals ( two stars simply for them) but no ambiguity as to what was what at the end, nothing to discuss except why did I fall for the critics reviews when I know better than to do that. As it stands, the end was a major fail unless you weren't paying attention. Rodriguez should have have chosen something better to lose her virginity moving to the big screen with. Portman who always does well even when the script is lacking, seems very disconnected. The biggest issue for me is that it could have been the movie the critics think they saw , done differently , more thought, better dialogue , an end that made sense by what came before it. Instead it's a cheaply thrown together ho hum that ' could have been a contender' , so to speak."
"835",5,"  This movie was haunting as it was interesting. Natalie Portman does not disappoint, her range in this movie was amazing. I loved this movie and will more than likely see it again before it leaves the Box Office. I am still having tremors thinking about the scene with the bear. I never thought another movie would make a scene with a bear as traumatizing as the one in The Revenant. I was wrong, there are other avenues one can go and Alex Garland went there and went there hard. ""Help me."" I literally had a shiver go down my spine. The imagery in the movie was amazing, and I won't know until I go watch it again but I am sure the all the prismatic effects of the rainbow were backward. If you watch this keep an eye out for that. There is something else that has stayed with me from my viewing last night, and that's the plants found in the small community, you'll know when you see them. When Josie describes how they came to be that also made me shiver. Not just now, but while watching the movie. There was one scene that I scoffed at, and that's when Lena tells Kane ""They had plans to go up to the country..."" I looked at my girlfriend and asked her who even says stuff like that. Other than that slight blemish, the movie was great. Tessa was amazing. I feel like Josie was an underused character for such a phenomenal actress. This movie isn't for everyone, you're not going to find a nice wrapped up answer at the end of the film. Hell, I have a thousand more questions now then when I saw the trailer. I can't wait for the blu ray fo the special features! I highly recommend this movie. If you love beautiful special effects, if you enjoy great acting, if you like to be scared to your core; go see this film."
"836",2.5,"  It wanted to be a thinker, but it ended up a stinker."
"837",0.5,"  Awful. I don't understand all of these reviews. It was like they read the back of the book and then said ""ok yeah. But let's make it more...Anaconda...oooh, OOH! And make the love story BIG, it's now the driving force of the story! One last thing, the biologist needs to be an ex military, college professor that can competently gun down a giant croc if needed... and the cgi was just..bad. Sometimes, when you try to add meaning and over compensate for what you see as shortcoming, you strip away every piece of meaning and just turn it into a generic horror movie with ultra mundane motivations. Half a star for Oscar Isaacs being in it."
"838",5,"  A somewhat original take on the Southern Reach Trilogy books. Strange, creepy, and thought provoking. We need more movies that take chances like this film."
"839",1,"  Given its RT scores I had high hopes for this movie. Boy was I disappointed! This was one of the most boring, uninteresting movies I have seen. And its not just me. As we were leaving the theater I overhead a group of people talking about what a dumb movie it was and that they had just wasted two hours of their life."
"840",1,"  Do not do it! Even my love for Natalie Portman and Sci-fi films could not overcome how abysmal the writing is in this film."
"841",0.5,"  My wife and both felt a lot less intelligent after seeing this movie. Graphics cool etc, but premise? really? Waste of two hours."
"842",0.5,"  I'd rather go to the zoo and watch hippos have sex than watch this movie again... I don't know why Hollywood feels they have to force women into men's roles... These stupid ass Hollywood producers need to remember that half the population is still men and if you keep pissing men off, their going to stop going to see the movies and you'll be working at Little Caesars pizza instead of being a big Hollywood mogul"
"843",2,"  This movie was absolutely beautiful.... and that's it. It made no sense and was beyond silly. Natalie Portman should know better than to do a movie like this."
"844",2,"  More plot holes than Swiss cheese. Everything blocked in simmer except sunlight? Why walk in instead of a humvee? Scientist go in alone w/o Ranger/Special Ops support? No military, FBI or Homeland Security oversight. Poorly written with little sense of reality."
"845",3.5,"  Like writer/director Alex Garland's last effort, ""Ex Machina,"" ""Annihilation"" -- for me at least -- is a rich, entertaining, and scientifically thought-provoking ride from beginning to. . .about ten minutes from the end. And though this one's ending is definitely less of a buzzkill, there's still an overall sense of coldness and confusion that I can't seem to shake. So much of the film's first 90% feels so meticulously well thought-out and crafted. Whether its from a visual, thematic, or character-based standpoint, the majority of this movie rings true. It's just the last sliver of the running time that adds so much, yet explains so little, ultimately rendering everything into one of the most frustrating additions to the sci-fi genre I've seen in recent memory."
"846",5,"  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and was both visually and mentally stimulating. It drew me in and kept my attention the entirety of the film. You must be paying attention to pick up on the nuances hidden within the story this movie doesn't spoon feed you and hold your hand explaining every detail. If you aren't open minded you will easily miss the greatest parts of this movie. It was motivating and inspirational and left me wanting more. It is a non formulaic film that will leave you wanting to come back and watch it time and again."
"847",5,"  Incredible sci-fi. Must see"
"848",2,"  I did not find this movie interesting. Too strange and with to much nonsense to my taste. If i had known, i would have waited to see it on dvd. Don't wast your time and money going to see it at the theaters. It is not worth it!!"
"849",4,"  Very creepy and really good. The sound editing, set design, and unique story are amazing; it's reminiscent of The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers without feeling like it's been done before. Very enjoyable sci-fi horror film."
"850",0.5,"  Stupid movie that I think is trying to be thought provoking, but the only question asked is WTF? I thought it was a total waste of time and money."
"851",3,"  Visually impressive, yes, and the movie certainly was patient with its storytelling. However, the pace of the movie, while deliberate and mostly engaging, detracted from any exposition or even discovery. Fans of Villeneuve's ""Arrival"" will find ""Annihilation"" to contain many of the same beats and tone, even if this movie is much more visually vibrant than ""Arrival."" The somber and humorless performances from the entire cast (with the exception of Gina Rodriguez) don't help to make the characters very memorable. The mystery of the Shimmer gives way to the mystery of the characters, and when the movie ended, I wound up with an experience that made me simultaneously full and empty."
"852",1.5,"  Alright, persons of variable gender identities, gather around! Grandpa D has another movie review and this time, I added sizzling passion to my words! On the chopping block is Annihilation (2018), the latest directorial effort from Alex Garland. This will be a spoiler-free review (as usual) and I'll be sourcing any plot material that was revealed from the already-released movie trailers. Now then, this is a feature with a lot of promise, given that Alex Garland delivered an amazing Deus Ex Machina for science fiction fare. The promise is of a movie that would deliver an alternative perspective from an all-female crew caught in a paradox: the world they enter is known to them and yet, it bears qualities that disrupt their personal grasps on reality, both physical and metaphysical. I was looking forward to this cast (helmed by a solid performance from Natalie Portman) and that excitement grew by the first half of the movie. I was expecting a psychological case study into how this crew will adapt and survive in this altogether foreign environment. As soon as introductions are finished, we learned that these characters were not superwomen but instead, (initially) written to be fractured souls looking for some form of redemption. It felt like a breath of fresh air to see these characters beginning to struggle with their physical inabilities in a genre riddled with incredibly-adept characters. I was expecting to be witness to the resourcefulness, cooperation, and intelligence of this crew of five, instead of the tried-and-true displays of muscle and brawn we've grown accustomed to. Unfortunately for my expectations, I bore witness to a rather unremarkable feature that readily devolved these characters into victims of survival-horror tropes.Once the second creature interaction occurs, it becomes plainly obvious that Mr. Garland will not deliver us the promises of fully-realized characters. After this creature interaction, the movie becomes as uninspired and stale as the creature designs themselves. My friend and I had quite a laugh at how poor the CGI seemed at times when we have been subject to remarkable CGI fare in the past. The ""big reveal"" and ending was even more disappointing in how uninspired the whole affair seemed. I had a suspicion that this movie was written to be too self-conscious: in a grand display of irony, the core theme of this movie (change by mutation) served to describe its chief pitfall. This screenplay is a mutated amalgamation from previous fare, such as Contact (1997 with Jodie Foster); Solaris (novel); creature design from Resident Evil; and The Astronaut's Wife (1997 with Charlize Theron). I am certain that if you've been exposed to the aforementioned material, you should have a good idea of how this movie will play out and the ending bore little-to-no surprise at all. Honestly, I would avoid it altogether. Save yourself the hassle and wait until it becomes free on Netflix.I give this uninspired turkey dinner 1.5 Wub-Wubs/5. I would tell you why the wub-wub, but then it might ruin the ""surprise"" for you. I just hope that Alex Garland does not become the next Neill Blomkamp."
"853",5,"  This was a trippy ass movie, especially the last few minutes of it. It was like 2001: A Space Odyssey for biology...lol. I'm still trying to process the movie.I recommend watching it alone and in a relatively empty theater. You need to think about it."
"854",4,"  There will always be a debate as to whether you should read the book first before seeing the movie. In the case of Annihilation, I have never read the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer. I almost think that's an advantage going into this movie, as I had no idea what to expect or where it was going. Natalie Portman plays Lena, a biology professor at Johns Hopkins University. It's been a year since her husband, Kane (Isaac), went missing while serving in the military. One day he arrives home completely disoriented, unable to answer the questions she has for him. He starts having a medical emergency, but when they're en route to the hospital, a convoy of police intercepts them. Once they arrive on a secretive compound, Lena and Kane are separated and kept in isolation. She proceeds to learn there is ""a religious event, an extra-terrestrial event"" going on. It's called ""The Shimmer"" and it's slowly growing and taking over Area X. Kane was part of a group of soldiers who dared go into The Shimmer. No man, animal, or drone has made it out alive, except for Kane. There are four women (Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tuva Novotny) attempting to go back in, and Lena requests to join them in hopes of figuring out what happened to Kane.Annihilation is the latest from Alex Garland who received acclaimed for his film Ex Machina, also starring Oscar Isaac. He's becoming a sought after auteur in the futuristic sci-fi genre given these two films as well as writing Danny Boyle's films 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Annihilation continues to prove his staying power as it takes a strong vision to not let a film like this collapse under its own obscurity. It's a real think piece from very early on when we see Kane mysteriously appear out of nowhere. It becomes apparent there's a massive government conspiracy happening, which feels very X-Files like. The vagueness continues to widen once Lena starts to learn about The Shimmer. Garland wants the audience to feel as in the dark as Natalie Portman's character. There's a point when you realize that it doesn't necessarily go in chronological order, which completely throws off what you think will happen next. The longer Lena and the other soldiers are in The Shimmer, the more questions arise for the characters and audience, and the film rarely gives concrete answers. You're left constantly asking what happened before the women entered The Shimmer, what's going to happen next, and who can you trust along the way.For me, what was stunning is that The Shimmer is a place of full of puzzling contradictions. It's thought of as this negative force killing off the human population, but inside, it's full of rainbow hues and lush foliage as you find out that it's regenerating life from inside. There are other moments when Garland keeps this place dark and frightful with just enough jump scares to really keep you on edge throughout. There's an animal encounter that makes the bear attack in The Revenant look wimpy.Much like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, or even the more divisive Mother, it goes in some bizarre directions leaving it up to the viewer to bring their own religious background and environmental awareness to interpret what is going on. For some, it could be a religious allegory given its themes of survival and the eventual apocalypse. Garland could also be making a commentary on our never-ending hunger for knowledge, truth, and answers. We're always looking for more and demanding more of others. Maybe he's trying to claim our own greediness will be our own downfall as nothing is ever good enough. The lack of answers will no doubt frustrate half the audience. If you're someone who needs a movie to make sense and be wrapped up in a pretty bow in the end, then Annihilation won't be for you. Garland is most likely staying in tune with the book, but I applaud the openness and trust he has by leaving it up to the audience to interpret this material in whatever way they want. It's the kind of risk more filmmakers and studios ought to be making.Garland' last film, Ex Machina, had a minimalistic approach given its three person cast. He's certainly gone in the opposite direction with Annihilation taking on very complicated themes. Science Fiction always seems to work best when it goes all in with the mystery and intrigue that comes with the unknown. I never want the director to give me all the answers or rely on shock treatment to keep their film going. Garland sidesteps both of these. He utilizes some serious girl power with Portman leading the crew consisting of Jason Leigh, Rodriguez, Thompson, and Novotny each going into The Shimmer with their own skillset as actors and characters. We don't often see this kind of film with little to no male counterpart along the way acting like some dumb hotshot. I left Annihilation with a flutter of questions that may or may not be answered upon second or third viewings. My head was spinning in the best kind of way wondering what I had just experienced. Isn't that the way it should be when you leave a theater?Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? A polarizing film that may leave you with more questions than answers, but boy did I love it.RATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS"
"855",3.5,"  Not as good as 'Arrival', somewhat on the same prismatic wavelength as the remake of 'Solaris', this heady sci-fi is isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is. However, it serves up psychedelic thrills alongside Cronenbergian unease as flesh shifts and and minds warp, and it's great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh back on the map; with her growl and impenetrable toddler's stare, there's really nobody like her."
"856",4.5,"  Mid-budget films are an endangered species. Hollywood isn't willing to risk money anymore on those kinds of movies because it seems to think that only bloated-budget event movies can be profitable. That's probably why Paramount has been sabotaging Annihilation, its own movie, every step of the way. Demanding reshoots, giving the international release to Netflix, and a review embargo are things you only do when a movie sucks, which is bizarre, because Annihilation is the opposite of a bad movie.Writer/director Alex Garland's previous film, Ex Machina, was a small-budget indie affair, but he handles the upgrade to a major studio production like a natural. The movie opens in medias res, giving away just enough information for the viewer to guess the basic plot structure. This lulls the viewer into a false sense of familiarity, but as information trickles through each flashback, you can't shake the feeling that there's something terribly different from this seemingly conventional tale. No matter how hard I tried, I could never quite predict when the movie would jump back into the present. Annihilation employs one of the best uses of a narrator I've seen so far, even better than last month's I, Tonya or Molly's Game. Without giving anything away, it's important to keep in mind that despite the lack of voice-over, what we are seeing is merely a visual representation of a story being told by a character. Contributing to the disturbance is the cinematography and editing. Annihilation is an uncomfortably still movie. The camera takes its time and pans or zooms slowly, but it never lingers. Each shot begins precisely when there's new information to show and cuts precisely when that information ends. The few times that rule is broken are subtle, but they're deeply uncomfortable when they happen. Likewise, the center of attention in each shot is rarely framed the way a traditional movie would. Generally, Garland refrains from placing his characters and objects in the center of the screen. They're off center because there is something off about this story.Although Annihilation is based off the first book in a trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer, it takes a surprising amount of liberties with the source. Everything about the backstory, to the characters' identities, to subplots, right down to what equipment they use, differs from the novel in some way. Part of this is a cynical attempt to raise the stakes, to be sure, and part of it is simply because they started making this movie before the trilogy was even finished, but part of the differences are for the same reason sound is utilized the way that it is. Oftentimes, the movie is silent, but when it isn't, it's flooded with overwhelming non-diegetic sound. I wouldn't exactly call it music. No, it's something different, something refracted. It's the same with the narrative. Garland has refracted the story to make it his own, and in doing so, he proves why distributors should support cinematic auteurs, not hold them back. Hopefully, audiences will take notice, as long as they're willing to actively think about the film."
"857",4,"  ""Annihilation"" is a visually stunning and consistently thrilling sci-fi adventure that benefits from powerful performances from its cast. However, the biggest bright spot in the film is the intelligent story that touches upon deep and thought-provoking themes, which you would need to be attentive to and analyze for yourself in order to be able to understand them."
"858",3.5,"  APOCALYPSE HOW - My Review of ANNIHILATION (3 1/2 Stars)Q: What do you get when you mix together ARRIVAL, ALIENS, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, APOCALYPSE NOW, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, UNDER THE SKIN, THE WALKING DEAD and LOST? A: Writer/Director Alex Garland's (EX MACHINA) latest, ANNIHILATION, a moody but messy beauty for those who prefer their sci fi laced with ambiguity and weirdness. Natalie Portman plays Lena, a medical school professor, whose husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) has gone missing on a top secret military mission for a year and is presumed dead. He suddenly returns, gravely ill, as the sole survivor of ""the Shimmer"", an area near a coastal lighthouse which seems to be slowly but surely taking over the planet after a strange meteorite crashes. Everyone who has entered, with that one exception, has never returned. Soon, Lena joins a team of women to enter this odd, rainbow-colored oil slick of a blob and maybe, just maybe save the planet from...wait for it...annihilation!Told retrospectively, with Portman being interviewed by a government official, the trauma on her face tells us things definitely did not go swimmingly for her and her team, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh as the dead-inside leader, Gina Rodriguez as a badass, lesbian ""Vasquez from ALIENS"" type (and she excels in this film), Tessa Thompson as the quiet nerd, and Tuva Novotny as the most likely to become a ""red shirt"" since she's not as well known as her fellow actors. Regardless, it's nice to see women uniting and saving the planet in the type of film that has tended to lean male since the beginning of cinema. Although the film leans in on its concepts of environmental decay along with a headier theme of the need to evolve in a relationship with someone or die, ANNIHILATION has some supremely chilling scares, laced with some unexpected gore. At first, the Shimmer contains gorgeous fauna and flora and other assorted mutations, but something nefarious emerges. I won't say what it is, but the Smoke Monster and the Polar Bear from LOST have nothing on what Garland offers here. Tonally, the film feels quiet and sad. Garland wisely sticks close to his star, honing in on her every mood shift. Portman does wonderful work, showing smarts with her decisions despite her less than perfect past. Garland often over-extends his metaphors, almost blatantly telling us that the way we deal with our own inner struggles will directly effect the survival of our species. As such, things get more and more muddled as it goes along, and because he maintains such a serious tone, many may find the events a bit laughable. Personally, I liked the control Garland shows here. It's a solid piece of storytelling, with just enough unresolved mystery, and the creepy sequences lovers of this genre crave. I wish all of the characters, particularly Isaac's, had more dimension. I may have felt more in the end had the characters had more layers. Garland also wants to make this story about EVERYTHING!, biting off a little more than he can chew. But...Rob Hardy's cinematography captivated me in a similar way to that of ARRIVAL, spare, controlled, and precise. Mark Digby's production design looks gritty, strange, and gorgeous, sometimes in the same shot. Sure, the look sometimes tips into silliness which would have not looked out of place in the execrable WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, but it's an oddball aesthetic I haven't seen before. The sound design earned points, especially when a bear exhibits human qualities. I could have done without the Crosby, Still & Nash song ""Helplessly Hoping"", which not only seemed too on the nose, but its earthy harmonies seemed at odds with the visuals, much in the way THE WALKING DEAD sometimes employs strange music choices. It's still a beautiful song and does ground the story in reality, so it's not a totally bad choice. With EX MACHINA and ANNIHILATION, Garland clearly wants to challenge our humanity. Many may find his approach pretentious, but I like that he's taking chances. In the cookie cutter world of studio films, ANNIHILATION manages to break the mold a little. Are we at a tipping point again, where the majors are taking chances on such movies as MOTHER!, and now this? Love it or hate it, I truly hope so."
"859",0.5,"  not worth your time or money. 2 thumbs down"
"860",4,"  In general, Annihilation was a good film and I highly reccomend seeing it"
"861",5,"  So freaking good. Best movie I have seen in awhile. Amazing audio during the movie. Must see in theatres. Felt like I was in a trance watching it."
"862",3.5,"  ""Annihilation"" is a sci-fi thriller set in a mysteriously altered natural landscape. As such, it's more than a little reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 classic ""Stalker."" Both films are striking in their haunting images and conflicting impressions of imminent dread and wondrous discovery. Where they differ is that Stalker focuses on self exploration while Annihilation shines brightest during its moments of horror. There are echoes of movies like ""Alien"", ""Event Horizon"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in Annihilation, so if you enjoy sci-fi horror on any level, this is probably a film you'll like.It has some loose ends (including a largely irrelevant sub plot) and the third act is the weakest one, so this movie is not without its flaws. Its saving grace is some fantastic tension and the well crafted visuals which get progressively creepier until the film's ominous ending. Since we only got one interesting sci-fi film in all of 2017, it's nice to see one so early in 2018. Having made ""Ex Machina"" and now ""Annihilation"", I think it's fair to say that Alex Garland has some solid momentum as a fine director of modern science fiction."
"863",4,"  Great movie its a must see at the theatre."
"864",5,"  ""Annihilation"" - Let's start right off with the grade: A+That's right. A totally original movie. Like nothing you've ever seen. Wildly imaginative. Mysterious. Thrilling. Thought-provoking. Beautifully told. Beautifully shot. Beautifully imagined. Beautifully acted. Few movies ever capture your attention like this. Go see it! I'll definitely be seeing it again soon."
"865",1,"  Dialogue is horrible."
"866",3,"  ""Am I you? Are you me?""These are the pivotal words spoken late in 'Annihilation,' Alex Garland's directorial follow-up to his breakout hit 'Ex Machina.'The film is unequivocally high-concept--perhaps too much for its own good--in a dazzlingly-shot, heady sci-fi thriller. The more one understands biology--specifically cell biology--the more one is able to appreciate how tightly woven the plot is, and how insanely clever and audacious the ending turns out to be."
"867",3,"  The movie was unusual. It is well made and beautiful with good acting. But when leaving the theater, it left me wondering if I liked it. There was a lot of questions left when you walk out. If they had tied off more lose ends I would have liked it a lot more."
"868",5,"  Thinking person's sci-if horror. Natalie Portman is stellar."
"869",1,"  Don't waste your money."
"870",3.5,"  Very interesting and original story like the book. Visuals are pretty amazing and it's not too predictable. There are some bad elements of the plot and movie, but overall it was a great sci-fi thriller. There is a lot to love and appreciate and there are some valid reasons to call this a ""bad"" movie.As a sci-fi fan, you know none of them are perfect and this is right up your alley, especially if you like movies such as Alien or Predator. If you're not into any of that, you might want to pass on this or wait for Netflix."
"871",2.5,"  A lot of style but little substance. Great cast but dull and lifeless acting. Entertaining and engaging but a little too much nonsense at times.The metaphors are obnoxious and in your face. Its one of those movies that seems smart and makes people feel smart for being able to follow the science buzz words to the end. A smart looking movie that dumb people that think they're intelligent will think is smart."
"872",3,"  More fascinating than fun and a good time overall but ultimately does not take full advantage of its brilliant premise. Annihilation comes up short when compared to Director Alex Garland's previous indie Ex Machina but as a Hollywood film, the movie is refreshingly abstract and as visually haunting as Ridley Scott's Alien, plus Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh bring an intensity to their roles that enhances the material."
"873",5,"  turned out to be one of my favorite sci-fi movie... indeed a dream,surreal experience"
"874",5,"  The Millennial child of Roadside Picnic & Solaris."
"875",4.5,"  Annihilation was a great Sy Fy movie. Its kind of a better more exciting version of Arrival or some others. Natalie Portman is great, and beautiful of course, and the whole cast does fine. The suspense and mystery in this movie are what make this movie work. I highly recommend Annihilation to Sy Fy fans."
"876",5,"  Alex Garland's directorial debut, Ex Machina, was a sleeper hit. He returns three years later with Annihilation; a film that defies your expectations of science fiction. You won't believe what you see, much like the characters in the movie question their surroundings. Packed with mystery and ambiguity, resting on the foundation of biology, it evokes a sense of curiosity. The concept of going into an otherworldly geographical area reminded me of Arrival, while the final 30 minutes had the same scope and dubious wonder as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Annihilation is your modern day Space Odyssey, and Garland is a modern day Kubrick. This is a spectacle to behold, and if you're an intellectual, it'll resonate with you for days, weeks, or even months. I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't wait to see it again."
"877",4.5,"  Garland has done it again. A visionary classic. Though no actual reason for the movie, it definitely gives the audience a reason to gasp."
"878",4.5,"  Good move, kept me interested the whole time. Beats watching the millionth SUPER HERO bs."
"879",5,"  I plan to see it in theater again, and buy the UHD version when available for home. Nuff said... If you like this genre you'll love this movie. It's not without its flaws, but they are few and far enough between to be excused. It is one of those movies where you may think it is ""about"" some theme, on reflection later to realize for you it is about something else entirely. I've heard many interpretations of that, so will not spoil it for you. There are movies where I know that someday I will think back to when I first saw it. Fewer still where I know I will also remember my internal experience as vividly as the movie itself."
"880",4,"  I don't know how to describe this film, I really enjoyed every minute."
"881",4.5,"  4.5 stars, so hauntingly beautiful it's still crawling in my skin! Writer/Director Alex Garland pushes new boundaries in the sci-fi genre. Also Natalie portmann's best since Black Swan."
"882",4,"  Annihilation rests safely on the shoulders of its fascinating and imaginative visuals and its solid direction does the thought-provoking source material justice making for an incredibly immersive experience that fans of unique philosophical works should definitely see."
"883",3.5,"  Mostly stunning, cerebral, and bleak science fiction/thriller fusion. There is some heavy handed CGI and action sequences but the emotional and philosophical undertones hold your hand through the hiccups. There's a multitude of talent present in this film that mostly gets to shine but is veiled at times by some thin plot and inconsistency. Generally, Natalie Portman is a complete show-stopper once again and Alex Garland, as expected, has created yet another modern sci-fi mammoth. Not a perfect film but a memorable and unique addition to the genre."
"884",4,"  Greeat Sci Fi movie, terrific body horror violence and terrifying ideas in this movie. The bear making a certain noise made me smile in horrific it was. If you like The Thing/Alien/Under the Skin. Don't be a retard and see the boring ass Black Panther for the second time, support movies like this or else we won't see any more of these be made."
"885",3.5,"  Did not find it interesting. How do these movies get rated so high."
"886",5,"  This is a movie that caters to an audience with a high EQ. People with low EQ just won't get it. Still, I don't understand how people can be so blind to the wonderful themes within this movie. The main idea is literally within N.Portman's opening lines. It uses cancer as a metaphor for the human existence. We think of cancer as ""death"" but like us, it's just a voracious organism that won't stop consuming and reproducing. It's not a malevolent act. It's just in our DNA. So much of what we perceive as our ""humanity"" or ""freewill"" is actually just our biology running its course.  However, there is the anomaly of love and empathy. It gives us hope that love is the one thing that trancsends our biology. It's the reason Oscar Isaac""s character was driven to go ""inside"", while simultaneously the reason his clone was motivated to venture ""outside"". Biology is what makes N.Portman cheat. Love is what gives her the strong motivation of guilt and makes her the only woman that truly wants to ""return"". The mirroring action scene at the end is a perfect way to show us what we really are. If we pitt our ""Humanity"" vs our Biology. Biology would match it blow for blow. If we try to escape our biology it will run us down. But if we accept and acknowledge it, it can allow an EXPERIENCE that cannot be quantified. There are many other themes refracted from this main shimmer, and if you only look at the obvious things illuminated you will be confused, but if you look and observe the light itself, you will see a novel love story."
"887",4.5,"  Many will clamor and say ""What just happened? I don't get it!"" but it was such an intelligent and wild ride. Annihilation is visually intense and the sci-fi concepts will have genre fans contemplating it's ideas for days. Plan on going to see it twice."
"888",5,"  If you are reading reviews, stop and just go see it. The less you know the better."
"889",0.5,"  Horrible acting, plot has too many holes. Seems like a social project in Political Correctness. ALL Women entering a dangerous region, carrying weapons. And they don't know how to use them. If fact they often choose not to use them. (HINT: When fighting monsters, use the bullets to kill them!) This was such a terrible movie, that if I were not with a couple who invited us to join them, my wife and I would have walked out. I lost all intrest 20 minutes into the movie. It became a very painful experience, and in the end made me question our friends judgement in picking movies. I'll never go to the theatre again! Now I remember, why I stopped going to the theater back in 2016. (I hate the Liberal elites who want to tell the majority of the country we voted for the wrong person, when they can't even make a good movie anymore. They should concentrate on acting, and not politics. They stand a better chance at being successful if they keep perfecting their craft. Because they suck at giving their political opinions to people who could care less about their pathetic, rich, drug fueled, pedo driven lifestyles in a fantasy world, that most intelligent people want nothing to do with.) No thanks. No more of my money goes to HOLLYWOOD movies. I'm opting for the Indie films."
"890",3.5,"  Virtually all who saw the movie left without any clear idea of what the movie was about. That may be the director's aim but it left many thinking they wasted their money."
"891",4,"  Solid Sci-Fi. Should have been handed to you in smaller portions so you could explore on your own a little longer. Not for young children."
"892",1,"  Extraordinarily boring, zero context and character development...Already sold to Netflix."
"893",3,"  I really enjoyed the movie up until the end. I loved the mysterious scientific journey the movie seemed to take you through, but about 3/4 of the way through that concept was shred to pieces, as the seemingly supernatural took over. I was really hoping for a scientific answer at the end, or at least some sort of resolution, but there wasn't much. As disappointing as the ending was, the movie as a whole was fascinating and there wasn't a dull moment. That being said, I hate movies that leave so many questions unanswered."
"894",2.5,"  Disappointing. No characters that we care about. No plot elements that are interesting. Lots of holes though. I understand that the book series is highly regarded, but after seeing the movie without reading the book, I am mystified why. Most children over the age of ten could have figured out a way of exploring an anomaly better than this movie does. A supposed team of scientists doesn't do anything even remotely resembling the scientific method. Lame."
"895",5,"  Well made, well acted and beautiful overall. This movie is an allegory about life and self-destruction. This is a cult movie , I bet you that you will be thinking about it for a few days...until you figure out the concept of this sci-fi."
"896",3,"  Annihilation 3/5 StarsThis is a beautiful film that is also a horrifying sci-fi mystery. We follow Lena along as a biology professor who's husband disappears on a secret mission. ..or DOES HE? Lena attempts to unravel the questions pertaining to a strange phenomenon that defies explanation and incurs a government cover-up. Look , i cannot really get into much of this without spoiling it, so i will just say that Natalie Portman is convincing as always but left her charm at the door. This is a broken woman coming to terms with some hard emotions, but also facing the impossible unknown. Oscar Isaacs is passable but the story primarily focuses on 5 women who all really nail their very different and interesting characters. it's great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh getting more  work and Gina Rodriguez and Tesa Thompson bring some energy. The sound design is inconsistent. The big moments, the terrifying, the weird sequences all get some unforgettable audio tracks (if this movie gets any award nods, it will be for sound design) but the slower parts of the film keep going back to this acoustic guitar throw-away filler piece when it isn't silent that is. it's as weird as the rest, i guess. Do you like being creeped out? Do you want some new disturbing images to bounce around in that sick twisted brain of yours? Are unanswered science-defying questions a turn-on? Well then this is the movie for you. Me, i love this stuff, but i cannot give it a higher rating based on what i think is a very niche genre of film that most audiences arent really signed up for. Don't bring the kids unless you want them to start wetting the bed again."
"897",2.5,"  The CRITICS are SMOKIN in this one!! Not bad but not Good Either."
"898",4.5,"  See Annihilation. Alex Garland > awesome"
"899",2,"  Visually, this movie was good, but other than Portman's character, there was very little character development, Jennifer Jason Leigh seemed like she was on heavy dosses of valium and reading off a cue card & the story, which had the potential to be really good, wound up leaving me with a lot of questions, and not in a good way - more like questioning all the plot holes."
"900",2.5,"  It had it's high and low moments. A lot of questions in the final scene."
"901",0.5,"  Dumb pointless. Like zero actual science. Just dumb people running around in a cool place doing dumb things."
"902",0.5,"  Plot was minimal at best. Some nice visuals but way too many questions and holes."
"903",5,"  Lots of suspense. Fascinating sci fi plot, highly recommend"
"904",3,"  This movie is pretty to look at, and the score and sound design are very effective. But if you are going to spend money on making a film, you should make sure the story makes some sense. If this an alien invasion? If so, why do the aliens spend 4 years and tons of energy to transform two people? And everything else you've (the aliens) done is easily and instantly dispatched with a single phosphorus grenade? If this just an astronomical/biological/natural accident? Then again why is some much energy expended make stuff look pretty? And why make everything so interconnected and extremely flammable? If this is just some head-trip, then, uh...who cares? It's all in their heads. This appears to be a movie-by-committee. You know: Writer 1 ""Ooh...how about if the antelope have flowers in their antlers?"" Writer 2 ""Or if the bear has an exposed skull and screams like a girl?"" And there was no one there to pull all the lose ends together. Too bad, Garland, because Ex Machina was brilliant."
"905",4.5,"  Awesome screenwriting. Special effects were also great. Directing and acting well above average, but could be better. Overall, I loved this film."
"906",1.5,"  This had all the makings of a good movie but it fell short. The acting wasn't the issue the plot wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. One of the main issues I had was the fact that they only sent out a small crew to find out what happened to the others so that made for the movie to be very slow and boring what I wished they would have done is put more people on the mission that way they could of had more action maybe have the mutant Gator and bear take out a few more people it would of made the movie a whole lot more interesting beisdes why would they only send five people out to an uncharted area where nobody has come back alive from you think they would have had atleast 10 or 15 more people with them. It also seemed like the movie was filmed with bad lighting it sure seemed dark a gritty inwhich this film should have popped off the screen especially when the went into the area X. My opinion is they wanted to make a good movie but they didn't want to spend the money on good cgi and put more but lesser known cast members in the movie .Should have been a movie but fell flat. Side note they still won't let me type my review for Black Panther. I just want to know why?"
"907",4.5,"  Annihilation is not a run-of-the-mill scifi movie and worth the theater ticket price. I loved the strong female characters and the overall creepy/mysterious atmosphere. The scares were much more effective because they were not the conventional scares audiences have grown accustomed to (movies like the Alien franchise). I look forward to what they do with the remaining two books in the Southern Reach Series."
"908",4,"  I was simply blown away by this uniquely told, thought provoking and visually stunning science-fiction movie. In my opinion, Alex Garland is part of the subgenre that is well-produced, well-acted sci-fi based on mind-bending concepts. Even though I didn't come out of the movie understanding everything, it made me think about the nature of life. And for me that's worth the price..."
"909",2.5,"  2.5/5.0 stars - Grade: C"
"910",3.5,"  Visually entertaining and a movie that stimulates the mind. There are several loose ends that could have been filled in better with more time. Should have been longer in my opinion. The science aspect was cool though."
"911",5,"  EXCELLENT. Sad, Haunting, Scary and Beautiful. If you need 'happy little bows' tied in your movies, not for you. But for everyone else, PLEASE go see this."
"912",3,"  Interesting sci-fi film that keeps you thinking long after you view it."
"913",5,"  Excellent thriller! Very creative and visually interesting."
"914",4,"  Sci fi for thinkers who can tolerate - and indeed enjoy - ambiguity, nonlinear chronology, unfamiliar ideas and unresolved questions requires an audience with intelligence, curiosity, patience, and an attention span that exceeds that of mainstream audiences who prefer pretentious Star Wars space opera, hokey Star Trek nostalgia mining or the meaningless, testosterone-fueled adolescent kinetics of the Transformers series. If yet another over-baked CG retelling of the David vs. Goliath myth with robots, ray guns and REALLY BIG EXPLOSIONS!(TM) is your idea of cutting-edge science fiction, steer clear. This is not for you."
"915",1,"  Annihilation (The movie!) is another one of Hollywood's less interesting attempts to merge today's popular social fiction with science fiction. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny were way short of convincing. I truly wish the ""genetically augmented bear"" made it's debut sooner and more frequent throughout this film, as this computer generated entity was the only thing that was remotely entertaining /convincing and did a great job of removing some of the less convincing characters from the story .. The story line was somewhat thought provoking from a scientific perspective, however, it gave little back in the form of intelligent narrative, so in my mind this story told through the lens of Alex Garland was mostly pathetic and nonsensical. This film was created for gay people and women ... and definitely not for a straight blooded all American/All Canadian man. A very bad .. bad movie! This is a Rotten Tomato"
"916",3.5,"  A film whose intrigue and engaging plot suffers from a campy and bizarre 3rd act. While I loved everything up until the final 20-30 minutes of the film, the somewhat pretentious climax could not live up its engaging first 90 minutes. Definitely thought-provoking and worth a second viewing to take in all the elements surrounding the film."
"917",5,"  This might be the best Sci-fi movie in years. On the surface there's plenty of trippy things to look at but this movie also delves deep into existential paradoxes. Mind Blowing."
"918",4,"  Let's say right off the bat that Annihilation isn't for everyone. If you like sci-fi and I'll say weird sci-fi, then this is a movie for you (as it is for me). The colors, images and set pieces are excellent. All of the female leads do a very good job in telling this story from different perspectives. This story isn't told in a straight linear fashion which certainly can be tricky, but here it is pulled off. Let's say this, if you like Blade Runner 2049, I'd say there's a very good chance you will like this one. If you didn't like that movie, I'd say stay away."
"919",0.5,"  Very disappointed - left the theater wondering what the point was of making this movie. Maybe I'm too shallow to ponder, but don't care enough to do so."
"920",5,"  Not your typical sci-fi. It was a breath of fresh air in a genre that has far to many clones"
"921",3.5,"  A slow-burning, visually stunning, and terrifying, sci-fi mind warp adapted by ""Ex Machina"" director Alex Garland. Garland weaves his interpretation with intelligent themes that feel slightly too lofty in hindsight."
"922",1.5,"  Very slow moving and never really explains what is going on. The ending is very confusing but they use bright and flashing lights to distract you from plot holes. They expect you to just accept everything that is happening with no explanation as to why it is happening. I would not watch this again or recommend anyone waste their time watching it."
"923",5,"  A rare event these days: a totally satisfying film. It absorbed me completely into its world and left me thinking and wonder-ing about it long afterwards."
"924",5,"  Simply amazing! Nowadays, most movies don't leave you with anything to think about. They have a conventional ending and everything is by the numbers. I guess this is what the average joe wants? A mindless popcorn flick that you'll forget after watching the next one? This was definitely unique, well acted and visually spectacular. I'm sure if you're not a fan of movies that leave some things unexplained this might not be your type of movie. In a time when Hollywood is churning out unoriginal, emotionless throwaway movies on an assembly line, this is refreshing."
"925",5,"  Very well done. Suspense-filled from beginning to end. And the last 15 minutes gave you a lot to think about."
"926",5,"  An amazing visual ride. By far one of the best modern sci-fi movies up to date, it is rather slow and the pacing can come off that way. But its all about emotion, the human condition and how we are affecting the world in an odd twist of fate. We see how humans build and change in the Shimmer. This movie is amazing, highly recommend it."
"927",5,"  Breathtaking. It captures the atmosphere and aesthetic of the books so well while also being very much it's own thing. ?I loved the books and I loved this movie, but if you have read the books I would recommend not going in expecting it to be a straight page to screen translation. My boyfriend has never read the books, but he also loved it."
"928",1,"  Natalie Portman cannot carry a film by herself. She just isn't credible."
"929",1,"  I liked the premise of the movie ANNIHILATION. A group of female military scientists enter ""The Shimmer,"" a mysterious quarantined zone that is full of mutating landscapes and creatures, to find why the previous military personnel never returned. Apparently, I wasn't the only one interested as the theater was near capacity (although the 20-screen complex was only offering this on one screen on opening weekend). Slow (and boring) start to the movie, but eventually the movie starts to pickup steam 35-40 minutes in with some exciting/scary/grotesque scenes and then the movie quickly falls flat again, with more boring flashbacks. The ending was anticlimactic which had the capacity audience leaving in silence (as in ""that's it?""). Natalie Portman is a talented actress and her skills were just wasted here. She looked out of place, and not believable as this character."
"930",4.5,"  Enjoyable watch, with stunning visuals."
"931",4,"  The amount of work put into adapting this impossible book to a beautifully arranged story and scenery while at points making me feel like I was on an acid trip."
"932",4.5,"  Visually stunning. Stellar cast. It's definitrly not perfect but it leaves you thinking and pondering a lot more then just the credits. Smart, risky, fightening movie (much more than just the bear- it's the questions it raises)."
"933",5,"  Was everything I was expecting, a amazing physicolcal thriller with convincing science about DNA and biology"
"934",0.5,"  the visual effects are as lame as the storyline. lets make a real movie for"
"935",1,"  Horrible... waste of money."
"936",5,"  If you liked Sunshine, you'll like this.It's a different kind of movie. It makes you think. It's no ""big budget sci-fi blockbuster"". It's beautiful. Go see it. Don't waste your time if you expect a Micheal bay style movie. This will be above your head. TLDR: Go see it unless you're stupid( because you probably won't like it.)"
"937",5,"  This movie makes you think, terrifies and confuses but also delights and amazes in equal measure. The visuals are stunning, the music is lovely and haunting. At times the character development seemed rushed, but the enigmatic themes and fantastical effects won me over."
"938",3.5,"  This movie is worth watching once, but its probably better to go with your book club than to go with a date (unless your dating a biologist), The cerebral slow march offers a lot to think about, but I wouldn't call this movie fun or exciting. It will, however, offer something to think about and something to talk about with the right company."
"939",5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Especially the idea of duplication w/ mutation to get to 2.0."
"940",2,"  From the director of Ex Machina, the movie was EXACTLY what I expected. A weird flick with great reviews that makes no sense. This is one of those ""intelligent"" films that a lot of professional reviewers love to rave about, because it makes them seem smart in the process.I'm not going to waste my breath on details, but I will say this...it may be categorized as Sci-Fi/Horror (and that bear scene in the base was admittedly creepy...the only reason this gets two stars instead of one), but if you're looking for a thrill ride along the lines of the Alien franchise, you're not going to find it here."
"941",5,"  It is a very visual tripy movie. I really liked it. Smart people would enjoy these movie, the average 100 IQ audience, maybe not."
"942",2,"  Let's get the good out of the way first. The acting in this movie was pretty exceptional. Tessa, Gina, Natalie, and Isaac all gave incredible performances. Jennifer portrayal of her character didn't really make me understand what she was trying to convey or portray. Now, for the bad. Pretty much everything else. The storyline started nowhere and went nowhere. The whole storyline just made no sense. I still don't know why these alien creatures were on Earth. Were they out to ""annihilate"" Earth's living beings? Were they here to clone them? Were they here to create a whole new type of living creature? Was the mission to create a world like their own, akin to Steppenwolf's mission in Justice League? No idea."
"943",0.5,"  ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!"
"944",4.5,"  Andrei Tarkovsky drops acid, and creates an episode of the X-Files. Starring Natalie Portman. Higher praise I could not bestow. Or maybe it's just an anti-GMO allegory. Why are you still sitting there?"
"945",2,"  ""LOL WUT"" - the ending"
"946",0.5,"  Well made, but didn't work for me"
"947",4,"  slow at the start, kind of confusing in places but all around a good time."
"948",0.5,"  So many decisions characters made made no sense. The big reveal made no sense. The movie made no sense. The one redeeming thing about the movie was the CGI was fantastic... but it doesn't make up for the nonsensical plot and characters."
"949",3,"  Way, way too hard to understand the ending. Otherwise a great sci-fi story. Plot well done right up to the last 15 min...then I got totally lost. My wife said it was a bad as Prometheus. I'm not going that far, but wasn't all I had expected. Bummer."
"950",4.5,"  Great movie. Awesome visuals, cool idea. I thought it would be good and it was much better than i expected. Go see in the theater."
"951",3.5,"  If you have intentions to go to the movies this weekend to have fun and be entertain, chance are Annihilation Movie is not for you! ?? it's a bit of a philosophical sci-fi that leave you thinking and discussing this film for the rest of the day. Know that after seen this film, I feel like my brain exploded!! The ending it's not literally but very philosophical! One to meditate and understand the meaning behind it"
"952",1,"  A total disappointment that I felt was a waste of time and money. It started out with promise but the prolonged stares and strange noises that left everyone in wide-eyed wonder made the tired storyline even more boring."
"953",2.5,"  only for true sc-fi fans."
"954",0.5,"  An amazingly bad film. I can't believe I stayed for the whole thing"
"955",0.5,"  I'm utterly baffled by the high rating this movie is getting. However, kudos to the actors for putting on a good performance despite the low-quality story they had to work with. Every movie requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, but the screenwriter really abused that with glaringly unintelligent actions by characters that were supposed to be intelligent. Examples:In the years that it's been there, no one that has gone in to the shimmer has returned (including highly trained soldiers)? Well then, clearly 4 scientists should be able to do it with no escort.A GIANT mutated alligator attacks and takes a full magazine from an assault rife to kill? Taking boats instead of walking on land sounds like a good idea.They are smart enough to set up camp in the tower, but then set up watch on the ground 50 feet from the tower with a bright light on it? Seriously?There are many, many more examples, but I'll wrap up with this; the story hinted at the possibility of thought provoking ideas, and then failed to deliver...on anything."
"956",4.5,"  Annihilation is the film equivalent of a flavor explosion as the film manages to combine various different genre elements from both science fiction as well as horror and uses it to the benefit of the film's themes to craft a film that's not only every bit as, if not more challenging, as Ex_Machina, but also leaves you wanting more from the Southern Reach trilogy."
"957",3,"  Mass Audiences may find this boring but this is Sci-Fi, it's suppose to make you think and this movie does a fabulous job in doing so."
"958",5,"  Very good overall. Visually interesting. Story was good."
"959",5,"  Felt the need to balance out the mixed reviews on this one. This is an amazing movie but do not go to see it if you don't want to be challenged or don't appreciate brainy or ""artsy"" sci-fi. It may look like an Alien-esque horror film but it's not. Sure there's a few jump scares but the ending is something most people won't like. It's not a movie for the masses. But what there is is brilliant cinematography, fine performances (especially by Natalie Portman) and a concept that will have you thinking for hours after seeing it. I'm not going to give away much more as Thais is a movie to be experienced and thought about on your own (maybe with some help from others afterwards).Just please don't go to see this if you are expecting a popcorn action flick."
"960",3.5,"  ""Annihilation"" (R, 1:55) sounds like it should be a sci-fi - horror - action movie. As the musical prophet (Meat Loaf) has taught us: two out of three ain't bad. This movie is firmly in the sci-fi / horror camp. There is some action, but the focus is more on the characters - a female cast, atypical for the genre.Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a medical school biology instructor and former U.S. Army soldier, whose active-duty special forces husband (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) goes missing on a top-top secret mission - for a whole year. When Kane suddenly shows up in the hallway outside his old bedroom, he's... not himself. After an emotional embrace, Lena demands answers from the practically catatonic Kane, but he doesn't have many. Then, he experiences a severe medical episode which lands him - and Lena - in a top-top-top secret government facility just outside a gradually expanding land and shoreline area called ""The Shimmer"", hidden behind a colorful curtain of light through which drones, animals and people have been sent, never to be seen or heard from again, well, except for Kane, that is.Rather than sitting on her hands while Kane may be dying in that building, Lena talks the facility's psychologist (Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh), into letting her come on the expedition she's about to lead into the Shimmer, along with three fellow scientists, played by Gina Rodriguez, Josie Radek and Tuva Novotny. Since the male military teams haven't been able to survive the Shimmer, maybe, just maybe, female scientists (or, simply, scientists, as one of them points out to Lena) will be able to have more success. They each have their own reasons for volunteering for what may well turn out to be a suicide mission, and they each have their own struggles surviving an environment in which strange, new plants and animals exist - and rapidly... mutate - as do the bodies and minds of those in this expedition. With ""Annihilation"", ""Ex Machina"" writer/director Alex Garland adapts the novel of the same name (the first in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy) by Jeff VanderMeer and helms the film as well. As in Garland's previous work, the character development is excellent, the acting is great and the optics (the visual effects and the creatures) are stunning. This film is engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking - Alex Garland at his finest. Framing the story in the context of a post-expedition interview does little to enhance the story and it actually reveals more of the story (told in flashbacks) than necessary - and the pace of much of the film is a bit slow - but ""Annihilation"" is solid, inventive and entertaining enough to make up for those minor flaws. ""B+"""
"961",4,"  Enjoyed it very much. Very strange and lingers with you afterward."
"962",5,"  Loved every second of this movie. It was creepy and fascinating. Natalie was her usual pretty good but Jennifer Jason Leigh was better. Actually the whole ensemble rocked it!"
"963",1.5,"  I'm not thinking I should just avoid movies whose title is one word that starts with the letter ""a"" - because this movie ... is literally the second coming of 2016's ""Arrival."" So there are a few things to understand. First; the company that makes the trailer is not associated with the movie production studio. The trailer led me to believe this was an awesome Jurassic World-esque action movie, though Annihilation seems to be intent on being a thought-provoking exploration film. In actuality however, it was a death-paced crawl colored by hollow and worthless tropes of characters and filled with pointless flashbacks about a dead husband that has no bearing to the overall story. The second thing to understand is that just because someone has a great idea, doesn't mean that lone idea is enough to populate a movie. Such is the case with Annihilation. You're watching this thing, falling asleep, actually sleeping, remaining asleep, and then 80% through you're like - oh hey, that's fairly clever. This is what happened with Arrival as well. Having a single good idea does not a movie make. Movies consist of a plethora of good ideas woven together to tell a story. If you only have the punchline of a joke, but not the setup, no one will laugh. Annihilation fails to succeed because while it contains a clever premise, and beautiful visuals, it lacks any sense of pacing, structure, and characters that can drive the film. What results is a film you leave thinking ""Maybe, if i stretch the limits of my imagination, I could conceive a world where this might make a good book"" but as a movie, this didn't work at all. ... IT COULD HAVE WORKED -- but they didn't capitalize on any of the things we wanted to see. This was a really poorly written film with nothing characters and an esoteric ending on the same level of insanity as ""Lucy"". -- ""Oh, that's clever"" doesn't warrant watching an entire 2 hours of nothing happening"""
"964",3,"  such an intriguing and promising concept that unfortunately goes nowhere due to increasingly frustrating logic and an unsatisfying resolution. loses its way 40 minutes in and never recovers. still worth seeing for the cool visuals and the could've/should've been amazing factor."
"965",2.5,"  It just wasn't that good. But everything looked really cool, and it was scary so kudos to that. It's sad to see a good idea fall short."
"966",2,"  The plot was really slow but I did like Natalie Portman's acting"
"967",5,"  Words are going to fail me on this one."
"968",4,"  This film will not be loved by everyone. In fact, most people will not enjoy the movie. This film has stunning camera work and lighting. The sound design is very good, and makes every situation intense, even if it's in a colorful and bright environment. The cast is mostly female, but the director doesn't shove in your face that these are strong, powerful women. This movie will confuse you, and make you think. The person sitting next to you will have another opinion on the story than you. This film will cause debate among the Sci-Fi community, which is great. Overall, if you love Sci-Fi and a complex story, then I highly suggest that you see this film."
"969",0.5,"  this movie starts off really great- awesome concept combined with good acting. it gets lost about two thirds of the way through. the writing gets lazy and clichÈ, and the plot begins to rely too heavilly on mediocre cgi rather than character/plot development. unfortunately, the bad points outweigh the good."
"970",2.5,"  Warning. This is an artsy-artsy, somewhat WTF, sci-fi flic. A slow burn with intermittent action and lots of pondering by a clinically depressed cast. Sad thing is they could have done so much more with this concept and budget and still not be a Michael Bay shoot-em-up CG film. Basically a lot of wasted opportunity on something that had the potential to be a lot more. Of course, to most of the critics who live for this type of stuff, it was brilliant. For those of us who pay money to see it, you're left concluding it would have been better served as a rental in a few months."
"971",5,"  The cinematography was simply amazing."
"972",1,"  It looks good besides the obsession with lens flairs. But the story was a nonlinear mess with a disappointing ending that left me feeling empty inside."
"973",4,"  Mesmerizingly encased in an aura of visual splendor & ambitiously ambiguous storytelling, Annihilation is a daunting sci-fi thriller that leaves you scratching the insides of your brain for a good while. This film felt very reminiscent to something like Arrival but with a more sinister twist...think less Close Encounters, more Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Definitely one to revisit."
"974",4.5,"  4.5/5. One of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Most people will hate it, because it is not an audience-friendly movie. I urge you to watch it for yourself. Maybe you'll love it like I did."
"975",2.5,"  Intriguing sci-fi concept and theories with stunning visuals and a great performance by Portman, but overshadowed by a severely disjointed plot, slow pace and an unsatisfying ending."
"976",5,"  ""Annihilation"" is a beautiful study of self-destruction and a fantastic, intellectual piece from Alex Garland. Based on Jeff VanderMeer's best-selling Southern Reach Trilogy, Annihilation stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It was written and directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, 28 Days Later).When artists come together to work with big studios, there's often conflict. Big studios like Paramount Pictures aren't around to make amazing films, rather, their main focus is money. That doesn't mean great films can't be made, but they're more interested in appealing to the mass market. When you get an artist like Alex Garland who has a strong vision and a clear voice, it's hard to argue with that result. I'm glad we got to see the film Alex Garland made and not one that was changed to appeal to the mass audiences, because this film was amazing in so many ways. One thing I loved about this film was the general message itself. I won't go deep into it but it's a film about self-destruction and what we do to ourselves as people. We all approach it in different ways and ultimately, we all do it with a new goal in mind. He approaches this theme in a subtle way, one that's much more artistic and visually appealing than most other stories. Because of this, a lot of the general audience won't like this film at all, but those who dig deeper will see everything he's trying to tell us. Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance. Without a doubt, her performance felt so real and unnerving. It was subtle yet emotional, never feeling like she was overplaying her role. She was great as the lead and owned her character. Her, along with the rest of the female cast (and Oscar Isaac) were all wonderful. What I also like about the performances was that this was a movie with primarily women. Yeah, it's cool to see women have ""empowering"" roles, but Alex Garland did it in a more subtle and not so in your face way. As an Asian-American dude, I love seeing diversity win on screen. Garland was able to defy norms in a non-cheesy and respectable way. This film is not only one of the best visual masterpieces I've seen in a while, but the best of the year. The story is told through the visuals. The visuals aren't pretty just to be pretty. There aren't beautiful shots just to have them. They're all there for a purpose. Some of the imagery is so beautiful yet so simultaneously haunting. I literally gasped in awe at some of the things I saw on screen. The images are genuinely just astonishing and there's so much symbolism in the smallest of things. The film is well composed, well lit, and perfect in that sense.In the end, I'd love to talk about specifically what I loved about this film, but that'd be spoiling things. All I can say is watch this film, because it'll certainly be one of the best of the year."
"977",4.5,"  One of the most focused and ambitious science fiction films in recent years to hit theatres. Thrilling, visually stunning, thought provoking and tightly written. A perfect modern interpretation of the ""quarantine zone"" environmental thriller. Reinvents and transposes the Cold War fallout fear into the modern day seamlessly. Heavily influenced by Stalker, Alien, Predator, Akira, and visually reminiscent of The Thing. A must see for 2018."
"978",0.5,"  What a POS. How can I get a refund?"
"979",3,"  While interesting and incredibly intense at times... Annihilation never truly ever felt satisfying to me. I walked out with so many questions as to why the alien entity acted the way it did concerning the humans. Pretty to look at but ultimately a hollow film for me."
"980",0.5,"  Let me save you two hours. The movie, while having the same title as the book from Van Dermeer, is not based on the book. It may broadly share some similarities with the book - but it got every single thing that made the book distinct and turned it into pure Hollywood sewage. I don't even know where to begin, but I'll just point out the big ones:* No lighthouse keeper - those insane sermons written on the wall of the tower? Gone. Replace them with HR Giger bulls**t, because clearly, that's what Hollywood sheep can compute.* The lighthouse, itself - It's too complicated to have the tunnel/tower separated from the Lighthouse, just smish those two together* The lighthouse, again - Just smash a meteor into it, we don't want to bother explaining the dormant alien in a hundred-year-old reflector* Biologist, Psychologist, Surveyor - Nope. Just call them Becky, Annabelle, Juanita, or whatever disposable vapid name that the screenwriter crapped out. Names were a luxury that Area X didn't afford.* Journals in the Lighthouse - We have cameras! Let's just leave a single SD card behind for no goddamned reason.* Journals in the Lighthouse - part the deux - Everyone was writing journals, that is how the main character is even portraying the first book. If they had even bothered to read through to the second book, they'd still only be getting the story from the clone. Maybe they were going for the Unreliable Narrator trope?* Biologist, part the deux - We can't have some squiggly little researcher, let's make her a PROFESSOR! WHO KNOWS HOW TO ARMY UP SOME ASSAULT RIFLES! No. How about you give a hat tip to the little people that make the machine run?* Hypnosis - HAHAHAHAHA! That is a fancy science word that the normies won't get. Let's just leave that out altogether. (From the back) How do we fit the word Annihilation into it? Just have the psychiatrist, Becky, offhandedly belt that spew out as an afterthought a la Darth Vader shouting ""NNNNNOOOOOOOO!"" because that is super classy.Apparently, white phosphorus make the big bad alien go away. The Southern Reach were slobbering windowlickers who didn't think of just sending in a nuke. Let's end an existential horror genre of 'New Weird' with punching Cthulhu in the dick, crushing a brewski on our skull, and shout 'F**k yeah, America!""Eat a dick, Hollywood. Seriously, just eat a dick.I'm more pissed off with the fact that everyone involved in the making of this film wanted to make a pile of garbage but didn't have the nuts to name it something so they slapped a Coca-cola label on warm diarrhoea to make people think they were getting the real deal.? Don't try to sell a movie with a title from a book you won't even put 25% of effort towards that lauded 'Based on the novel by...'"
"981",3,"  A good movie, but a bit difficult to understand"
"982",1.5,"  The premise was incredible... the delivery was TERRIBLE.The best parts are the previews.Do not waste your time or your money"
"983",4,"  Slowly paced with a 3rd act to remember. Please support intellectual sci-fi and go see this."
"984",5,"  Beautifully shot and performed with precision. This movie is a sci fi lovers dream."
"985",4.5,"  Well shot, great set combined with amazing visual affects. Loved most of the casting. It's like Stephen king's Dreamcatcher on roids."
"986",2.5,"  It's got mood and it's nice to look at, but the characters are underwritten and I'm still struggling with competing metaphors of cancer vs. climate change."
"987",2,"  Really beautiful and some very spooky scenes, but over-all, the story was too distancing and disorienting to be enjoying. I love surprise, suspense, and delayed gratification, but this film just didn't land for me. I left the theater feeling cheated out of my time."
"988",2.5,"  A visually stunning but very disappointing movie after the mastery of @ExMachinaMovie . #Annihilation never really takes off and is littered with plot holes and things that don't add up, including a #manbearpig . The acting is subpar. 5/10"
"989",5,"  Two words .. IN-Credible .. This movie was just another beautiful Sci-Fi masterpiece to gaze at and dwell on in the same realm of a Stanley Kubrick movie .. In summary , its story reflects a scientific concept of creation , but damn it is done in spectacular mystery fashion .. and the climatic Lighthouse sequence is one of the most surreal pieces of film footage I've seen in recent memory, and that ending .. ooh! icing on the cake that puts the pieces together of the mystery behind the Shimmer .. Brilliant film"
"990",4,"  Fantastic. So beauiful and well done. As well as interesting and mind boggling. One step below Arrival, only because it wasn't clear to me what i was supposed to walk away with."

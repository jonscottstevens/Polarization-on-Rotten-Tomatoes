"1",4.5,"  The dialog and friendship between Paul and Luke was intriguing. Each helped one another through such a time of persecution. They stayed faithful all for the love of Christ."
"2",0.5,"  Folks, I'm a conservative Christian who really wanted to love this movie. But, please take it from me as the truth when I say this was an awful movie. One of the most boring films I have ever seen. I have not idea where all of these people who claim they loved it came from. So bad it was embarrassing to be there. Open the Book of Acts and begin reading it aloud while looking in the mirror.... now you have seen the movie. Gives other good Christian movies a black eye."
"3",5,"  I loved this movie!!"
"4",5,"  Great acting and very uplifting."
"5",4,"  A bit slow at times. Also, for the sake of the story I believe that they put too much emphasis on the fear of the Christians concerning death. I know why they did it--to make a more powerful ending. Wonderful powerful ending. Paul and Luke were great!"
"6",5,"  Very powerful movie. I'll be unpacking this for a while."
"7",4.5,"  Excellent. A must see"
"8",5,"  Very, very good - seeing where love can overcome hate."
"9",5,"  I loved this movie i wish more people would go see it!"
"10",5,"  Paul, Apostle of Chris is an outstanding film. Any true Christians seeking eternal life won't be walking out of theater doors with dry eyes. Atheists on this site predictably give the film low ratings as they will any Christian religious film and then try to disguise their biased comments with weak arguments. Also not a movie for those easily bored or impatient with dialogue and lack of action while being a superb movie for those attentive to actor's subtle dialogue and emotions. It is a well crafted fictional story of a believable possible way Paul and Luke lived through the end stage of Paul's life that is based on their faith on Jesus's most important message of salvation and eternal life. Watching the movie is often painful due to the ongoing horrors against Christians, but so is each of our personal struggles with reality we are mortal fleshly creatures that at the end of our lives possibly die into an eternal death without hope, losing everything we ever had, every experience and memory of our lives, losing everything and every one we ever loved. But in the end, the movie shows why those of us with faith have reason to persevere to the end with real hope."
"11",0.5,"  Horrible, not scriptural, does not distinguish between Paul's Gospel and the Circumcision , it mixes gospels, it does not portray Paul's character and nature, and there are many unbiblical scenes...it's very dissapointing that Caviezel and the writers didn't study the scriptures more before making such an important movie... this movie will do more harm than good... Paul even warns that those who preach a different gospel is cursed. Also , Paul would NEVER recite the prayer "" Thy Kingdom come.."" because Paul's future is in the celestials... not on earth with Israel..Christians need to learn to correctly proportion scripture and study to show thyself approved.."
"12",5,"  I think the movie was on point about what was happening to Christians during the time of Nero."
"13",4,"  Really good! It really makes you think!"
"14",5,"  I saw ""Paul, Apostle of Christ"". I found it AMAZING. Although some of it is not in the Bible it is only meant for pacing. It didn't deviate whatsoever Biblically as far as I can tell. Will need read Acts and maybe some of Luke to be certain. The film is quite dark but there are moments of joy as it rightfully should be depicted. Although the commercials make it seem it is only Paul's last days there are flashbacks visually or through the actor (James Faulkner)who portrayed Paul. I have not seen this much attention to stay true to the Bible since ""The Passion of the Christ""."
"15",4,"  Faith-based movies are making incredible strides. There is a great bit of good acting and solid cinematography in Paul, Apostle of Christ. The story does not develop as clearly and powerfully as it could have. The potential for Paul and the early Church's story is deep and wide, and little of it has been tapped in film as of yet. This Paul movie takes steps towards the greatness it could have been. With that said, as a lover of Christ and His word, I found myself in tears more than once as the film gave narrative context to some of the most powerful words uttered by human lips. This was especially true with the final, and greatest scene of the movie when Faulkner recites portions of 2 Timothy as he bears his neck to be slain for His master. What follows filled me up."
"16",0.5,"  The story is rich enough to make it a masterpiece. But for that, an atheist should have make this movie... It would have resonated brilliantly into today America. Unfortunately, the people who made it where too scared and the movie is just annoying and empty..."
"17",2,"  I had high hopes for this movie I was completely disappointed. This movie was a missed opportunity. They pick up the movie at the end of paul's life in prison in rome before his execution. they should have started the story when he was saul, a jewish Pharisee, his conversion, his preaching, travels etc. this movie depicts Christians as weak martyrs. James Faulkner is miscast for the role of paul as is Olivier martinez as Mauritius. he can barely speak a word of English. we needed subtitles just to understand him alone. they give the character of paul a condo for a prison cell, large, spacious, clean as a whistle lighted by torches and not a rat, snake or cockroach in sight. reality was that paul was kept in a prison cell where the sewage of rome ran through it and where he was forced to stand chained chest high in it with rats etc. swimming all around him. when mauriitius asks paul ""can your god heal my daughter"" paul's CONFUSED AND WEAK ANSWER IS ""I DON'T KNOW"" WELL, thank God for luke who comes in and saves the day. seriously? We need a movie showing the real power of our god, our savior and our gospel, not this."
"18",5,"  Amazing Movie! A must see for every Christian! ??????"
"19",1,"  This wasted Jim Caviezel's talents for me. I am putting Andrew Hyatt and Affirm Films in my own personal blacklist along with Disney and Whedon."
"20",5,"  Honestly, I was a little hesitant going into this, as a lot of Christian films tend to be cheesy, poorly-made, Scripturally and theologically flimsy/borderline heretical, etc. I could go on. However, the subject matter (Saint Paul) and the casting intrigued me enough to give it a shot. And I'm so happy I did.It's one of the best Christian films I have ever seen, and that's including the old Hollywood Biblical epics.This film gives a fair representation of the harsh reality of the lives of the early Christians. It's dramatic, but not overly so. It's blunt, yet gentle. It treats its characters with respect and heartfelt humanity. Most importantly, however, is the highest regard it shows to its inspiration, the Gospel message of Christ-the joyful hope and perseverance it gives, the transformative power it brings to hearts and lives, the truth and peace it gives in a chaotic world.The movie is called 'Paul, Apostle of Christ', and yet, the film isn't really ABOUT Paul. Which is why it's wonderful. Despite his great accomplishments, everything Paul did was not to bring glory or recognition to himself, but to Jesus. Despite being the greatest evangelist the Church will ever know, Paul considered himself unworthy of any boasting, except to boast in what Christ had done for him and the rest of the world.Saul/Paul had caused so much pain and suffering to the early followers of Jesus, and then he himself would come to know that same pain and suffering himself for Christ's sake. He knew death was not a loss or an end, but true life and gain.This movie is faithful to that message of God's great love. Go see it. A 43% critics score is absurdly hyper-critical, though, unsurprising."
"21",0.5,"  I often forgot the movie was about Paul. It was extremely slow paced and a poor portrayal of Paul and Christians in the first century. The faith of the Christians were very contrary to what is written about in the Bible. The entire movie teased a healing miracle that never came. The parts of Paul's life included in the movie were unengaging. Overal: BORING MOVIE!"
"22",3.5,"  Good true story film"
"23",5,"  Great great movie, although I assumed it would be more of a story about Paul's life. Rather than just the ending of it. Still very good especially when he gets greeted in Heaven by the lil girl."
"24",5,"  All about the ending. Great, moving movie."
"25",5,"  I (a grown man who isn't accustomed to crying) was in tears at the happy ending. This is an extremely moving movie. Now officially one of my favorite movies. It was sad to see so few in the theater. But it was a 5:20 showing on a Tuesday. I hope this movie makes plenty; so that more of this quality will follow! Can't recommend this masterpiece enough!"
"26",4,"  Jim Caviezel and James Faulkner were excellent in their portrayal of Luke and Paul. The plot will be hard for some to really get into and its rather slow paced. I will say that most people in the theater stayed until the credits were over and everyone was silent. This movie is thought provoking for sure, it may also pull at you to learn more about your faith or even to become stronger in that faith. Give it a shot at matinee prices if you're unsure about it. Acting is phenomenal by all those in the film. Worth seeing."
"27",5,"  Loved this movie. Great acting. Very moving and incredibly powerful. It has helped me understand Paul's letters and the Acts of the Apostles more clearly and has put voices to my Bible reading."
"28",4.5,"  What an awesome movie!! A must to see."
"29",5,"  Awesome, inspiring film. Well acted and a beautiful story of redemption through Christ."
"30",5,"  This is a great movie, understand this is not about the life of Paul, this is about our call to serve Jesus.... even when we are attacked for our beliefs and actions.May you find as much encouragement as I did, it brought home the life that those in other parts of the World live in today. I pray we never see it this bad in America! God bless"
"31",5,"  This movie was the best biblical movie I've seen since the Passion of the Christ. It is true that the world doesn't know a thing about Love as Luke points out in the movie. I believe that is why many people don't like the movie. But if you understand Agape, you will enjoy the movie."
"32",5,"  It can be very difficult to make a biblical movie. There is a lot of pressure to creat a film that many would believe the source of the story to be fictional and produce a plausable narritive. This film exceeded my expectations. I really didn't know what to expect going into this film after recently viewing ""Samson,"" however, I was thankful I gave it a shot.The production of this film was above average. CGI was not overdone and the acting was inviting into simple biblical narritive that didn't overwhelm nor undercut the struggle of first century life for the believer in Jesus.I was pleased by the accuracy of the historical evidence we have and more over this story didn't attempt to make everything supernatural and mystical. It was encouraging to see the struggle of faith in Jesus as Christ was a challenge from the very beginning of the church.I'm no expert in movie reviews, but I wanted to say this film deserves a go for the person of faith. Again, this film offers a ""plausable"" account of the beginning life of the church. I don't think the message of the film is to convince you that this is what happened at the end of Pauls life. It is a fresh invitation to consider our life, our struggle and our message of the gospel of Jesus to the world we live in."
"33",4.5,"  There are several narratives in this movie that correlate to today's life for believers: My faith sometimes falters because I've never seen Christ; Given the cruelty of world where is God? How should I confront death?A good movie. Will be liked by believers."
"34",4.5,"  ""Paul"" is a good example of hoity-toity critics being divorced from the movie-going audience. A majority of critics gave it a low rating but the audience 89 percent. (Thank you Ann Hornaday of the Washington Postt for giving it a positive review. ) This is a fine, powerful movie, that is unforgettable. It is not for delicate souls. It takes place in the last weeks of St. Paul's life while he is imprisoned in Rome. Christians are in hiding, hunted down like animals. Should they flee Rome or stay? Their fellow Christians are herded into the Collisseum to be devoured by lions as entertainment for the Romans. Does ""turning the other cheek"" make any sense? Ideas like this are very hard to dramatize but this movie succeeds in doing it. It does not shy away from showing the harshness and cruelty of Nero's Rome but it also shows what faith can do. Too bad that today there are more fake and lukewarm Christians around (like the Trump lovers) than Paul's Christians. If you want to know what real Christianity is about see this fine movie"
"35",5,"  This depiction of Paul's life and sacrifice for the gospel will inspire others to ask a very important question.....what am I truly living for?"
"36",3.5,"  A good show! Great cast and location. A tight and well developed plot with true human drama. Jim Caviezel ,joan Whalley and Jon Lymch are superb. A well made intelligent movie that tells a deep story. Worth it."
"37",4,"  Not a perfect film but the interweaving of Biblical text as dialogue was seamless and natural. The humanity of the apostles was real. They were not perfect individuals but they had been changed by the Messiah and this was acted out naturally. Would have been tighter without the Cassius subplot but from a faith-based film perspective, this was a 10."
"38",5,"  This is a great movie expaining an event in History and in the Bible. Loved it!"
"39",5,"  This is a beautiful movie!! The acting was fantastic and story well written!! I love how we see Luke and Paul together speaking of all they have done together. So good!!"
"40",2.5,"  Largely weak, some may like it for the drama aspect and there's some respect in that. But you could give this a miss. Passion of the Christ 2 should be better."
"41",5,"  Love is the only way. Amen"
"42",5,"  Great performance by James Faulkner and Jim Caviezel."
"43",5,"  Excellent movie. Strong performances by James Faulkner and Jim Caviesel. Wonderful how the dialogue weaves in and out of Paul's words in Acts of the Apostles."
"44",2.5,"  There are great actors in this movie. So why was the acting bad? Director. The story was in the realm of being long and tiring. Why is that? The writer. Some of the conversation uses common terms that take away from the classic language. Nice try."
"45",5,"  Well done and worth seeing, looking forward to buying this on bluray when it comes out"
"46",2.5,"  for the story of god it was okay"
"47",5,"  Well worth the viewing this weekend. Rich movie with a difficult subject but ultimately victorious ending. Will cause you to think and be grateful for the sacrifice of Paul and 1st century Christians for our Christian faith. This is an excellent encore for Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) back to Biblical movies. HINT: You will see him again soon in the Passion of the Christ Sequel! RECOMMEND."
"48",4.5,"  the movie was amazing but I wish there was more gore"
"49",2.5,"  As a Catholic, I am a bit ashamed that I do not know enough about St. Paul and the Acts of the Apostle enough to review the movie based upon the original source material--the New Testament itself! However, I can access it based on its merit as a film, and it is, I think for the faithful Christian, recommended viewing.First, I merit the film based on the recent turgid, Hollywood, non-faithful/ ignorant-of-the-faith recent films with faith-based themes, like Ben Hur, Moses, Samson, and Noah--all made by major Hollywood studios and with well-known directors behind them. That they focused solely on mere spectacle divorced from its underlying and most important message of faith is astonishing. Maybe I can say that they all floundered in the box office precisely because of its agnostic message (if there was any) divorced from faith but I think that would be acceding to ignorance. They were just poorly made films, I think, and, divorced from its faith-message, no reason for the true devout Christian to see them.Any faithful believer and adherent of Christianity would recognize that rare movie made by well-intended, well-informed Christian. This film is one of them. (Not to keen on who the director of this film is, nor its writer, the faith message in this film is clearly felt if not clearly intended).So take heart Christians and heed-not the poor reviews that appear from non-Christians for, being ignorant of the faith, they cannot access what's truly important in this film, which is Saul's last attempt at the Good News during the last year of his persecution. It may not be wholly faithful to the Acts of the Apostle but I think God would forgive that and bless its good intentions nonetheless. Recommend viewing for the Christian and the overall general public.I give it two and a half stars for its merit strictly as a film and merits as a film medium including its production values, but to be true, I give it three stars for its success as a faith-based film, which I think merits a separate rating."
"50",5,"  This was a Great Movie!! I loved every minute of it. There needs to be more movies like this. Inspiring and great message. Must watch!"
"51",5,"  I went in with low expectations because of the critics ratings and was pleasantly surprised with the depth of this movie. Olivier Martinez's role as Mauritius was particularly engaging."
"52",5,"  First, the great news. Hollywood made a movie about the Apostle Paul and featured a major TV star in the leading role.The production itself was first rate. The portrayal of the personalities of and relationship between Luke and Paul was intriguing and well considered. My guess is that Paul was indeed a bit of a curmudgeon, which is the way the actor chose to interpret him.The prominent role given to Priscilla and Aquila was enjoyable. These are two wonderful New Testament characters worthy of wider consideration.The reality of Paul's daily life in a dark, dank prison cell really hit home for me, as well as the reality of how his body must have been absolutely wracked with constant pain from years of abuse. Deeply moving and very humbling.I was disappointed by the extended focus on a fictional sub-plot that added nothing to the film when the Book of Acts is filled with so much fascinating material that could have been brought to life.I heard the movie was filled with flashbacks and had assumed they would flesh out some of his missionary journeys. They did not. I also would have liked to see more of Ancient Rome than two houses and a prison cell - although these three scenes certainly provide a glimpse onto the pages of the New Testament.Finally, I thought the portrayal of the 1st Century church as impotent and befuddled was inaccurate. They turned the entire Roman Empire upside down. And they certainly couldn't have done that hunkered down in a state of perpetual fear and confusion.Nevertheless, the film accomplishes much and we should rejoice in that. In just about two weeks, I will be co-leading a biblical tour ""In the Footsteps of Paul"" and we will be visiting the prison featured in the film. It promises to be a very powerful experience...and even more powerful having so recently seen the film.Let's pray for Hollywood to produce more faith-affirming films in the days to come."
"53",2.5,"  The movie is well made, beautifully photographed, well acted. I think the consensus critique above is accurate - simply not enough of Paul's story, which was the reason I went to see it."
"54",5,"  A beautiful story of forgiveness and redemption even fir a persecution. Going to see it again!"
"55",5,"  Biblically sound in regards to doctrine, aligns with history and scripture, and tells the truth of what really happened. Nothing extra and nothing that lacked. Im glad the film makers stuck with telling the truth compared to your typical standard of hollywood entertainment. Very surprised to see the ratings given by critics, deserves way more credit than this. We need more films such as these. Big thumbs up."
"56",5,"  Saw this movie last weekend and it was truly inspiring"
"57",5,"  This is not your average adventure thriller. It is deeply meaningful and bound to be misunderstood by the person with little interest in the values of Christianity. It is artistically and visually well done. The critic above obviously does not even understand that this is not a story taken from Bible. It is written from the point of view of background on what may have been happening as the book of Acts was being written. It demonstrates what was happening historically at the time. I give the movie an A+ in its genre of Christian-themed film."
"58",5,"  Gave me something to think about... I liked the line ""peace begins with you."""
"59",4,"  Solid performances and cinematography. Not the typical cliche approach to a faith based theme. Portrays authentic spiritual struggle of those who wrestle between faith and doubt."
"60",5,"  AUDIENCE SCORE says it all."
"61",5,"  I found this to be a very powerful movie! The cruelty of Nero""s Rome towards the early Christians and what they had to endure was incredible. The actors that played Paul and Luke were terrific!!!"
"62",5,"  This movie was both challenging and amazing!"
"63",5,"  We ventured out to see the movie Paul, the Apostle of Christ with much eagerness and anticipation.The movie is based upon the timeline and scripture of 1st and 2nd Timothy where Paul (James Fulkner) is imprisoned in Rome, already tried for treason, and is waiting for his death sentence to be carried out.The church in Rome is under severe persecution and faces a choice to flee or stay. The church sends Luke (Jim Caviezel) to seek out Paul's guidance in his final moments. While seeking out guidance Luke is also on mission to capture Paul's final thoughts of wisdom.This film is most certainly not for the faint of heart for it truthfully depicts the real life situations of the roman persecution and torture of Christians. There are some graphic scenes suited for a mature audience.The overall central theme of the movie is that love overcomes all situations and is the inspiration of every choice and action a believer should make.It echo's the central message of 1 Corinthians 13, the over flowing grace of Jesus, and includes some of Paul's most defining moments and testimony including his trip to Damascus.Every believer will face various trials and difficulties and although it isn't always clear which road to take it is clear how we should treat one another.The movie inspires the idea of who we are meant to be as Christians and what we were meant to do as the church. This movie will inspire you to appreciate the gospel message that was preserved through the persecution of the apostles and strive to reach further its purpose and meaning in the kingdom."
"64",5,"  Seems like many of the critics were expecting a different movie entirely. This is a story of the early church clinging to faith in the face of persecution, while Paul, at the end of his life, grapples with forgiveness. I found it to be quite dramatic throughout, and for me personally it was an intensely emotional experience."
"65",5,"  Enjoyed very much, good portrayal of Paul"
"66",4,"  Great, great acting. Kind of slow. But super informative. I learned so much."
"67",1,"  There is a treasure trove of great stories about Paul already provided for us in the book of Acts. Why didn't they try to tell us THOSE stories? Instead, we get a rather boring extra-biblical story that makes Luke look like a non-eyewitness."
"68",5,"  The film speaks to everyone...maybe not to critics. Well done and well performed by ALL the actors!"
"69",5,"  Here is what I think on the new movie, Paul, the apostle of Christ. It is like a beautiful meditation over the purest Christian core values without any pietistic attitude. A film, what I was waiting for. It shows the divine and the human in an excellent mixture. One of my favourite scene when Luke, the physician save the Roman's daughter's life with his medical knowledge (instead of healing her in miraculous way, which wa common that time). Brave art movie, showing those christian saints like humans and at the same time help to understand better the unimaginable Divine Mercy. Prepare space in your heart if you plan to watch! And I was just wondering, those critics, whom did't find enough action in the movie: what would they do with.. hmm for example northern europian art movies, or even Stalker ;)"
"70",5,"  Amazing movie! That is just a little bit that our brothers and sisters went through at that time."
"71",5,"  Great movie, captured a lot that was happening in time period you don't hear about. Next to Acts visual Bible this is the best movie about Paul I've seen."
"72",3.5,"  I like these religious movies for some reason, While I'm not a religious person"
"73",4.5,"  This was a very good movie showing how hard it was for the early believers. I really enjoyed this movie!"
"74",5,"  Well done. Must sew"
"75",5,"  Good movie. This movie made me want to learn more about Paul. Plus, I love how this movie shows the relationship between a Christian couple."
"76",5,"  As a believer and follower of Jesus Christ myself, this film gives a truth and realism how Paul came to the love of Christ and wanting to serve his Lord even through the trails he faces as a Christian. If you are a Christian I highly recommend this film."
"77",5,"  The best movie about the Bible I've ever seen. I liked it even better than the Passion. Highly recommended."
"78",5,"  The movie keeps true to the Catholic faith. It is in this world, but not of it."
"79",5,"  Well told, superb acting and no Hollywood agenda slipped into it ! ð???"
"80",5,"  The critics are so utterly predictable. This movie is powerful and uplifting!"
"81",3,"  Grade: BRating: PG-13, 108 minutesIn a Nutshell: Just in time for the Easter season, this Christian movie brings Paul and Luke, both faithful followers of Jesus Christ, to the big screen with their unique friendship and affirming messages.This film is VERY heavy, dark, gory, and even depressing. In that regard, it's very realistic. The film states at the end that is has been ""dedicated to all those who have been persecuted for their faith."" Christians will leave with a feeling of reverence and increased respect for the early Christians.While this movie really won't convince non-believers to turn their lives over to Christ, it is another arrow in the quiver of recent Christian movies that build faith and testimony. Christian movies are slowly getting better and I'm grateful that Christian audiences support them in movie theaters.Two additional Christian movies, a holy trinity of films so to speak, are also in theaters at the same time to celebrate the Easter season: I Can Only Imagine DVD and God's Not Dead: A Light In Darkness (Songs From And Inspired By The Motion Picture).Tips for parents: There are a lot of gruesome images of torture, deaths, bodies burning, and suffering. I'm almost surprised that this movie wasn't rated R because of so many brutal scenes.There is a LOT of talking with not very much action. Most children will be bored. It's definitely not a feel-good popcorn movie for a fun Friday night. It is, however, a thought-provoking film that will make you think and feel.Uplifting theme: Enduring faithForgivenessBe the light.Peace begins with you.""Love is the only way."" - Luke""We cannot repay evil with evil. Evil can only be overcome with good."" - Paul""Men do not die for things they doubt."" - Paul""We live for the Lord. We die for the Lord. Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord."" - PaulThrough suffering, good can come.Things I liked:I really like Jim Caviezel. Knowing that he is a solid Christian makes me like him even more, especially as he tries to lend his big star name and talent to Christian movies, which are often seen as amateur and cheesy. Jim Caviezel gave impressive strength to Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ Do you want to know what he did with a lot of the money he earned from that movie? He adopted 3 special needs children. Wow.I like the Giving Films logo and the name ""Affirm Films.""The production value was very high. Good technical work.I thought the Lord's Prayer scene was powerful.The end was very sweet.Filming was done in Malta, where Paul actually went on one of his journeys.Some humor.Some of the dialogue was full of rich wisdom.I really like it when movie theaters don't instantly raise the lights when a movie ends. Audiences are able to sit and reflect for a few minutes and even compose themselves before the lights turn back on.I really liked the scene where Luke told Paul that he saw Jesus in him when Paul taught the gospel. What a great compliment. Oh that people could see Christ in us!Things I didn't like:There are a LOT of scenes in dark corners and dungeons, making it hard to see what's going on. There are also a lot of scenes with whispered conversations, making it hard to hear what's being said.The various accents were distracting. Characters spoke with British accents, French, American, and even one guy sounded Scottish. Paul's famous ""Road to Damascus"" scene was surprisingly short. I wanted more.Some of the flashbacks could have been done better. It seemed like they were reusing footage to save money.It drags in some places, especially during the first half. My sister and I both got drowsy and had to keep each other awake. That's not good!Funny lines:""Come, eat. You must be starving."" - Aquilla (John Lynch)""If you're cooking, I don't know if I'm that hungry."" - Luke (Jim Caviezel)""Quit your complaining."" - Luke to Paul""They truly were miserable days with you. I do miss them."" - Paul to Luke Interesting lines:""The Devil sneaks in the darkness here."" - Paul (James Faulkner)""All men are a slave to something."" - Paul""Where sin abounds, grace abounds more."" - Paul""In a moment, you will know you know God's love and I hope it is soon."" - Paul""They will know us for our love."" - PaulIn an online interview with Jim Cazievel, he mentioned how he could watch good Christian movies like Ben Hur over and over. Be sure to watch that movie again this Easter season. It's old, but it's extremely powerful!"
"82",5,"  Great family movie. Enjoyed the story line - although not found in the scriptures, it was an interesting imaginative story."
"83",2.5,"  I thought it was so-so. Gave some visibility to the persecution that Christians experienced in Rome during the time of Nero, but I didn't find the story very interesting."
"84",5,"  I enjoyed the movie. Really made me think about what life was like for the Christians back then. Very moving and outstanding portrayal of Paul & Luke."
"85",2,"  I was hoping for a historical account. This is purely fabricated."
"86",4,"  I enjoyed this movie. James Faulkner was a good Paul and Jim C. was the pivotal character. It showed some of what Christians living under Nero faced - being used as human torches and having to make difficult decisions. The daughter being healed by Luke was a little too obvious but it made you think about how much the early Christians suffered as we sit in our reclining seats eating popcorn."
"87",5,"  A wonderful presentation of the struggles faced by Christians. I have heard many say it should have been called ""Luke"" but I disagree strongly. This movie focused on Paul, his writings, his message, his struggles. Luke played a supporting role bridging the gap between Paul in the Roman prison and the Christians imprisoned in their hideaway in Rome. The emotional struggles and hardships endured for the faith of both were handled realistically. Acting was excellent and believable. The ending was especially moving."
"88",4.5,"  As a pastor with a ThD in early church history, it was wonderful to see the history of the early church come to lif ron the screen. As a follower of Jesus Christ, it was heart wrenching to watch that history play out, also knowing the persecution that exist for Christian today in many countries. The Biblical themes of love overcoming evil and evil being overcome with good were found throughout. For the sceptic, one key aspect of Christianity still holds true: ""Men do not die for things they doubt."" I walked away with one question: Am I worthy to light the streets of Rome?"
"89",4,"  Watched it...first movie I PAID to see in over a year...well worth it... the LIBERAL movie reviewers are DUMBER than DOG SHIT for not liking this movie."
"90",5,"  Powerful performances, strong script, and great production values make this a must-see for teens on up."
"91",5,"  I just saw the movie, me an my husband really enjoyed it. It was great to see this perspective and interpretation. Thank you and keep them coming! ps get ready to cry at the end.."
"92",3.5,"  James Faulkner was really good in this movie and Jim Caviezel has redeemed himself after The Passion of the Christ."
"93",4.5,"  I loved STS Paul and Luke in this fantastic movie, I'm gonna read acts of apostles right now..movie enlightened me so much"
"94",5,"  This is an amazing movie, and is so consistent with the events as presented in the Holy Bible. Very surprising for a movie from Hollywood. To really appreciate it you must know something about St. Paul and St. Luke. I give it 98%."
"95",5,"  Loved it, worth to watch"
"96",5,"  I just watched Paul, Apostle of Christ.It was an excellent movie. As a Christian, it was deeply moving to me and there were several times I was in tears. Especially when Luke healed the centurion's daughter, it felt like a miracle.People of faith will have there faith strengthened by this movie."
"97",5,"  This is a love story about showing the Love of Jesus. It felt more personal. I liked it very much."
"98",3,"  it could have been exciting--all the things that happened to Paul--blinding, shipwreck, jail time. but the screen writers chose to do a movie about the last year of his life. Any exciting parts (not just him talking) were done as slo-mo flash backs. Children will not like, kinda boring. Good story, just boringly told. It will not be a keeper. no reason to watch it twice. even once, just reading the book of Acts is way more exciting than this movie."
"99",5,"  It is an amazing privilage to understand the contents of this movie."
"100",5,"  Brilliantly performed, wounderfully adapted and produced. This movie is a must see. With so many of the movies being produced today lacking real dialogue and meaningful messages, Paul, Apostle of Christ stands out as a testament to powerful magnetic performances with life impacting messages. Jim Cavesiel, one of the best under rated actors of our time, masterfully accounts for Paul's last days as documented and witnessed in his portrayal of Luke. This movie does not require a knowledge of scripture to be enjoyed. It's also rather disappointing that the critics who view Christianity as a threat to secular liberalism feel like it's their duty to attack this movie. Look at the audience ratings or better yet, go see the film and judge for yourself."
"101",5,"  great movie-did not want to see it but wife wanted too. glad we went great acting and would see it again"
"102",5,"  Our culture needed a movie like this. I loved it. It reminded me of how much we can impact others through love, just like Paul and Luke were doing. This movie included the negativity Paul received because of his spreading of Christianity, and to know how much Christianity spread all around the world from these simple 12 apostles is very empowering to me as a Christian. It shows what was going on in Rome, what Paul really did. Whether one accepts or enjoys the truth is up to them, but the film is shown to depict what really happened, not what our society wants to see."
"103",4,"  I loved how the film makers were able to portray the love of the early church without making the individual Christians seem less than fully human. It helps me to understand why and how so few became so many."
"104",3.5,"  Moments of brilliance, but I would have liked more focus on Paul himself. Many scenes seemed dark and underlit; whispering in many scenes, while plausible given the setting, nevertheless sucked the energy out of portions. Overall, it was intelligent and faithful to the characters and delivered some emotional and spiritual punch. I felt it was good but could have been much better with tighter editing, more of Paul's life outside of prison and better lighting / sound editing. I'd recommend it to friends."
"105",5,"  a great movie, the bible deserved it."
"106",4,"  It was moving and heart wrenching at times. It did not have the same impact on me as ""Passion of the Christ"" but it was still good."
"107",4,"  Great movie very accurate"
"108",5,"  Very rarely does a movie come along that I make an appeal for people to see (sadly, particularly a ""Christian"" movie). As a pastor, I like movies, so I see many of them, enjoy many of them, and I like talking to people about them, but I don't often appeal for people to please go watch a particular movie.Yesterday, I went to see ""Paul, Apostle of Christ."" It was simply fantastic. It personalized Paul and Luke in beautiful ways. Sure, they took a few liberties with characters and timelines. I can work with that. What really mattered was how they portrayed one of the most important men in history. They nailed it.I believe Larry the cucumber expressed it best when he said, ""I laughed. I cried. It moved me, Bob."" Whether you consider yourself a Christian or not, go see this movie. This week. Seriously."
"109",4.5,"  Contrary to most of the professional critics, who's politics and genre biased egoes have entered their critiques. I.e. Inkoo Kang (""Naturally, no sticking points about Paul's legacy, like his (disputed) rejection of female church leaders.."") I found this to be a very good movie with very good acting and leaving movie goers with mostly historically based truisms and leaving a good moral backing at the end of the movie, regardless of what is someones religious affiliation. Apparently, this movie is as true today as is depicted in the movie. Only at this juncture in time Christians are not yet being murdered, yet being belittled and besmirched because of ones faith. I guess that is why you see an audience score of 90% verses a 35% on the tomatometer. Silly critics once again you miss the point and try to make yourself better than others."
"110",5,"  The Audiences got this right , the critics got it wrong. A movie full of tears and passion if you know truly what's at stake during these times in Rome."
"111",5,"  As I reflect on what I felt about this movie I am filled with Joy on so many levels. The art of this movie brought the time period to life and put me in the time and place the earliest Christians experienced. They were just beginning to grow in Faith and sacrificed so much. Bringing the words of the Bible to life is extremely personal for me since that is what I try to do in my devotions. This movie made me think in ways I never had about the life of Paul. Go see this movie! I pray this movie will touch all that see it and bring them to a deeper, personal relationship with God."
"112",5,"  I'm a Christian in ministry, so call me biased. But I generally do not like Christian movies nor do I recommend them, so call me unbiased. I was moved to uncontrollable tears by the end of this movie. I recommend it to all believers, especially those sincerely involved in ministry."
"113",5,"  This movie was executed on a cinematic level with The Passion of the Christ. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Love wins in the end, as it always does."
"114",4,"  Pros: Very moving and inspirational. Good acting, with average production quality. Thought provoking and immersive character development for those who have a base of biblical knowledge. Cons: Slow pace, too much use of slow motion, not easily accessible for seekers or those with little biblical knowledge.Overall: an inspirational and encouraging must-see for Christians and perfect for showing to small groups or Sunday School classes."
"115",5,"  Well done. It helped me see Paul in a new perspective."
"116",5,"  Great movie! Just remember it is a story based true events, not an exact replica. All members of the Sanhedrin probably won't like it. Christ is the center and that is all that matters!"
"117",5,"  I've been bible thumping for 35 years. The movie is excellent!!!; everyone should see it; there are some nitpickers who will attack any Christian movie; I think a lot of those who attack this movie are nothing but atheist trolls who hate anything Christian. If you are a Christian or don't hate Christians, then this is the movie to see. Don't listen to Pharisees who will find some iota in the movie that they say isn't 100% biblically accurate. The movie is the best Christian movie of 2018, and for the last 10 years for that matter."
"118",5,"  the same (((critics))) who hate this loved the last jedi and shilled for it like it was the best thing since sliced bread. let that sink in, folks."
"119",5,"  This film is masterfully written and acted. I hope it's warmth and truth spread throughout our land. I cried more when I got into my car and on the drive home."
"120",2,"  The movie trying to tell Paul's story from the point of view of Luke. However, lacking of the showing how Paul's life change after accepting Jesus the whole movie is slipping to ""Luke, the brave, loyalty travel partner of Paul. ""The costume and acting are detailed. I was touched when Luke saw someone he knew was burn on the post the struggle in his eyes and the teardrop."
"121",5,"  I m not religious and sometimes the acting was not great but. There is always a but. Good solid movie Sadly no sex no ar 15s. Sarcasm here. And not a sequel"
"122",5,"  One of the best movies I have seen in a long time."
"123",5,"  I saw Paul: Apostle of Christ today. It is excellent. It is very accurate historically and biblically. It also gives time for contemplation, prayer, and meditation. I highly recommend it."
"124",5,"  Outstanding!!!! Moving story and message! The theater I went to was sold out for this show! I will be seeing this movie again and will buy the DVD! James Caviecy is a truly gifted actor! Do yourself a favor and see this movie!"
"125",5,"  This movie was very deep. Each character presented a human perspective in front of a human question. So often religious movies glaze over the flashiness of the Christian faith. But, we are human, and we both struggle with and recognize reality."
"126",4,"  Powerful movie. Well acted. Great message."
"127",5,"  Deeply Stirring ..Leave your Horseys Home! I would like to see it again before it leaves the theatre."
"128",2.5,"  A well-meaning mess. The acting and production values were so good that I still found the ending emotionally affecting, but the script and direction completely muffed the story-telling. Pauls story is actually a very exciting one, but unless you know it, you will barely understand how it is told here. Sad."
"129",5,"  Powerful, moving. I highly recommend it. It is difficult to watch at times but very realistic, Rome under emperor Nero was a time of tribulation."
"130",5,"  Fabulous film! The film assumes it is playing to a somewhat biblically-educated audience, which is understandable given the theme. However, even someone living under a rock all their life would find the film enlightening. The lighting, the lack of gruesome details, the dialogue all pull this film together to make a memorable experience for the audience. I'll probably go again, and I will certainly buy the dvd when it comes out."
"131",5,"  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was very inspiring!"
"132",5,"  Dont listen to the critics. This was an amazingly acted and delivered film."
"133",5,"  Powerful portrayal of the Apostle Paul's struggles and wrestlings with spreading the Gospel of Christ to the Roman Empire. James Faulkner delivered such a riveting performance that during his monologues, there was utter silience in the theatre with the feeling the viewers didn't want to miss a single word of his performance. Jim Caviezel's role as Luke was true to the insight he gained in his role of The Passion of Christ. His fervor to get Paul's words recorded and spread among the believers was palpable and teleported me into the Roman prison cell with them. I think the best possible review is in knowing that not one dry eye left the theatre after watching this film."
"134",5,"  Absolutely amazing movie, incredible acting and ... Hollywood please take note -- it is a true and inspiring story of love! As someone who has read and reread the Bible, this is a wonderful big screen adaptation of an exciting adventure about Paul (Saul of Tarsus) and Luke (writer of a few New Testament books). For those who are more intrigued by super heroes, special effects and sequels, you may have a hard time. For those of you who enjoy greta acting, appreciate intelligent dialogue, theology or history - you'll love it!"
"135",4.5,"  Story of Paul as seen through Luke. This movie touched my Soul, to have such Faith in the darkest of times to truly know that your are going to be with the Lord if you accept Jesus and know that death is but an instant and eternal life is there just for the asking."
"136",5,"  Great movie. Critics are completely out of touch with audiences."
"137",5,"  Sheila, Deborah and I walked away from that movie learning ""Love"" is all that matters. The movie was excellent. Every scripture took me back to bible. I walked away from the movie with revelation and knowledge. Thank you for enlightening my understanding to the book of Acts. As we exited the movie, there were 2 other ladies standing outside. We all had shed tears, and we understood that we were all from different races, cultures and background. We all felt the LOVE that was express throughout the movie. Well done!!!"
"138",5,"  Reading Biblical and non-Biblical historical sources I've often wondered what it must have been like to know the Apostles; to observe their personalities and interactions first hand. This movie places you in the room with them. Authenic to the period and Scripture with excellent cinematography; it's a well crafted movie."
"139",5,"  This movie makes me want to dive right into an extensive study of The Acts of The Apostles and beyond. Mr. Caviezel andMr. Faulkner were brilliant as St. Luke and St. Paul. The entire cast was wonderful (I need to read more about Aquila and Priscilla now)Thank you so much for bringing their story to the screen!!"
"140",5,"  Beautiful movie! James Faulkner is brilliant in his portrayal of Saint Paul! And, Jim Caviezel gives an equally powerful, inspired performance as Saint Luke! I'm inspired to read the Letters of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles from beginning to end thanks to this lovely and Biblically grounded tribute to Christ and His Love which conquers all!"
"141",5,"  Powerful account of Paul's imprisonment, Luke's documentation of Paul's conversion and teachings and Christian's life in Rome during these times."
"142",5,"  An excellent film. If you're looking for word for word biblical recreation, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you're hope is to be inspired, by a film that dramatizes the early church, and glorifies God - I don't think you'll be disappointed. Well done."
"143",5,"  I loved this movie. A beautiful and harsh reminder that we should never take our faith for granted. Love and compassion are far more powerful than hate and vengeance. I also enjoyed the bits of humor between Luke and Paul"
"144",5,"  Great biblically based book. Very emotional. Excellent. Highly recommend."
"145",5,"  One of the best movies 2018 has to offer"
"146",5,"  I really enjoyed this movie. Obviously some liberties have to be taken since we don't know all that happened during the persecution of the church in Rome and right before Paul's death. But the movie is solid in scripture. I felt they depicted Paul well. Luke was awesome. People forget when reading scripture that Paul and all the disciples were real people with real emotions. Paul had to wrestle through all the things we do in our hearts. He had a past that he had to surrender to Jesus. I like his vulnerability. The love we are to live with is demonstrated great. The persecution and the challenge that it poses was clearly portrayed. I would recommend this movie to any Christian and anyone seeking truth. And let this prepare you for what could easily take place in the US. Our brothers and sisters are already suffering all over the world."
"147",5,"  I saw the movie Friday night and it was amazing and powerful. Was so glad to see it was Biblically accurate. This movie will touch a lot of people, my prayer is the Holy Spirit will move and see people come to Christ."
"148",5,"  The encouragement that this movie brought to us is life changing! Very blessed to watch this movie here in the Philippines! We have nothing but gratitude to everyone who made this possible. THANK YOU! I will definitely tell my fellow Christians to watch this movie! To Him be all the glory!"
"149",0.5,"  Religious junk. Only crazy Christians would find this a good film. Boring, badly done, bad acting and a stupid story. Rleligious fantasy stories for the stupid."
"150",5,"  This is a great family movie, my teenage boys all got a lot out of it. The message that Jesus teaches us about loving our enemies was clearly portrayed. I highly recommend the film and support it opening weekend if possible."
"151",5,"  Excellent film about the Gospel."
"152",5,"  Astounding, moving ending... don't want to give anything away, but whoever thought of it deserves some kind of award!"
"153",5,"  This movie is stunning not just for the historical perspective but also for the implications of Christian faith today. The love that theseChristians showed in the midst of true evil must be the love that Christians show today."
"154",0.5,"  A new faith-based, unnecessary movie."
"155",2.5,"  ""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" (PG-13, 1:47) is a biblical drama directed and co-written by Andrew Hyatt (""Full of Grace"", ""The Last Light"", ""The Frozen""), featuring an international cast which includes experienced actors from both film and television. The plot centers around the writing of the biblical book of Acts.The film opens with Jim Caviezel (who famously played Jesus in 2004's ""The Passion of the Christ""), as the apostle Luke, arriving in Rome as the Christian believers in the capital are suffering constant persecution under Emperor Nero - and the apostle Paul (James Faulkner) sits in prison awaiting his execution as an enemy of the empire. After conferring with Aquilla (John Lynch) and Priscilla (Joanne Whaley), the leaders of one Christian community in hiding, and tending to the medical needs of their people, Luke visits Paul. Aided by a prison guard, Luke starts paying regular visits under cover of night.Luke convinces Paul that the world needs the encouragement of hearing his story and Paul starts dictating what would later become known in the Bible as the Acts of the Apostles. This allows for brief flashbacks showing the journey of Saul of Tarsus (played by Yorgos Karamihos) from merciless persecutor of Christians to the loving, faithful imprisoned leader of the church. We also get to hear conversations between the two church fathers about the past, present and future of their faith. Even though a man named Mauritius (Olivier Martinez), the Roman officer in charge of the prison, learns of Luke's visits, he allows them to continue because he sees no harm in any of it - and he is intrigued by Paul and Luke, even as he prays and sacrifices to the Roman gods for the life of his sick daughter. As Luke continues to visit Paul, Aquilla and Priscilla struggle to keep their community together and safe in the face of the threat of violence (ranging from being beaten by Roman soldiers to literally being thrown to the lions) and internal disagreements about whether to stay in Rome or flee - and whether to answer Nero's persecution with the love Jesus preached or the more practical response of violence.""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" is an interesting and high-quality, but often dull portrayal of a pivotal period in early church history. In spite of the film's title, the amount of screen time devoted to Paul makes him little more than a supporting player in his own story. The script excels at character development, but contains little action, in spite of the abundance of drama which we know existed at this time and place. As ""talky"" as this film is, however, the performances are solid across the board - and particularly outstanding from the main actors - while the production values throughout the film are very high. Of course, we can legitimately question the historicity of the developments portrayed given that the filmmakers relied solely on biblical accounts, without the benefit of more objective histories. This film's strengths are its acting and its technical achievements. ""B-"""
"156",5,"  It starts off a little slow, but it gets good"
"157",5,"  A powerful movie that I will go see again. And when this comes out on DVD I will buy."
"158",5,"  The amazing team that brought us RISEN, has brought us a wonderful synopsis of the Apostle Paul's life in Rome. Powerful powerful history, powerful message. Love never fails. Excellent production, fabulous acting!"
"159",5,"  Excellent account of the struggles of early Christianity in Rome and the courage of those that were being persecuted."
"160",5,"  Powerful movie! Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it."
"161",5,"  This was a amazing movie. I would say the best I have ever seen. Filming stunning and message profound."
"162",5,"  I thought it was a great movie."
"163",5,"  Outstanding portrayal of Paul and Luke. Piercing footage of the persecution in Rome at the time, of Christians. So worth the watch. There are thoughtful conversations that are longer in the middle of the movie; some may think them too long. The stories of individuals are woven throughout very effectively. Very, very moving, with a lot of believable suspense and drama."
"164",4,"  I liked the movie, but had hoped it would spend more time focusing on the Acts of the Apostles."
"165",4.5,"  First half was a little slow and stilted but the second half was so beautiful and poignant. A great experience for believers."
"166",5,"  Incredible is an understatement! The story line was so compelling and definitely put you right there with what life was like 2,000 years ago for St.Paul & Luke! Makes you feel so thankful for the gift of the Catholic Faith and for all those who were and are still persecuted for the Faith. This is a MUST SEE, especially before Easter! Deo Gratias!!!"
"167",5,"  Good Christian content that honored the Risen Christ ad his early disciples,"
"168",5,"  This is an important film. It is the Bible come to life, accurately, and brutally. It speaks of hope, love, redemption, grace, and godliness. In Paul's writings, he paints a clear portrait of a Christ-follower and constantly reminds us why we do what we do. Jim Caviezel is brilliant as Luke, and it's hard not to see him as the Jesus he portrayed in ""The Passion of the Christ"". This actually works, because it is a subtle reminder of the unseen center of the story...Jesus. James Faulkner is exactly who you picture as Paul. His portrayal was spot on. The Bible does not address the end of Paul's life, but history does. This movie tells ""the rest of the story"" and in doing so, answers the persistent question ""if God loves you, why does He let you suffer?"". Read Luke and Acts to learn more. I encourage everyone to go see it to support a good film ...and to stir your soul."
"169",5,"  Well Done, Touching, brought tears to my eyes. Suggest all christian see it."
"170",5,"  Great job by Jim Caviezel as always"
"171",5,"  It was a really well done movie. A must see!!"
"172",5,"  A must see, showing how Christianity survived after Christ was Risen and the darkness of Rome before they adopted Christianity. ..Christ's Love wins over"
"173",5,"  AWESOME..a must see movie!"
"174",5,"  Inspirational portrayal of Pauls last days in prison. A little slow in some places, but the ending makes up for any lag in the plot."
"175",3.5,"  This is not your cup of tea if all you know about Christianity is a graphic of Christ with a lamb over his shoulders. If you have read Paul's letters, Luke's gospel and the Book of Acts, then this film will speak to you in a positive way. To the uniformed it's a lot of speaking that comes across as boring gibberish, and it's action that has no context. If you have a personal relationship with Jesus, this film will be a spiritual buffet. Professional acting and effective cinematography."
"176",5,"  Great movie!!! Highly recommended."
"177",5,"  I saw this movie today and thought it was great. I'm not a scripture expert, but the story of Saul/Paul is very compelling in that everyone can be forgiven and loved by Jesus."
"178",5,"  Very good movie!!! Highly recommend seeing it."
"179",3,"  A bit slow paced, and I was hoping for a more in depth reflection on Paul's life as Saul and his conversion. Honestly I believe a life like Paul's needs to be approached with a grittier director that is willing to show the honesty and ugliness along with the contrast of the beauty of life. Paul's life was filled with great darkness and intense light. I believe this was a missed opportunity."
"180",5,"  I really enjoyed this film. The production value was quite high and the storytelling was solid. The dynamic between the three male figures was really well done and conveyed very nicely, the different stages these men were in their faiths. There was not as much action as the trailer implied and I enjoyed that, as there were several quiet moments where the story was able to be more subtle and I appreciated that spacious feel that those moments were given, There was also a lovely addition of some gallows humor between Paul and Luke that I really loved. In the end I cried and was left filled with awe at the sacrifice the early Christians were forced to endure for their faith. I would highly recommend this film."
"181",5,"  St. Luke's account of the persecution and ultimate triumph of St. Paul is a deeply personal tribute. The Acts of the Apostles are referenced, as are the contributions of Aquila and Priscilla. It is a spiritually envigorating retelling, well worth the experience."
"182",5,"  Truly inspirational story. Really humanized the early Christians and their persecution and unwavering faith."
"183",1,"  Movie review ""Paul, Apostle of Christ""Two thumbs down ????I had high expectations and I have One word to describe this film - AWFULI find this movie Faithless and Hopeless. Presenting a powerless gospel with a portrayal of Paul and Luke as carnal Christians. I believe the true purpose behind this film was to present a view that the gospel is of no effect. A film that will leave the audience feeling that Christianity is just another religion, that you can ""take it or leave it""."
"184",5,"  Well written movie with a steady and constant build right up to the end! Masterfully portrayal of the persecution and danger facing the early church and how following Christ is not easy."
"185",5,"  Absolutely LOVED it. So much more interesting than the sex & violence drivel put out by most of Hollywood these days!"
"186",5,"  Great movie! Watch it if you get a chance. God Bless!"
"187",5,"  im curious how good it will be"
"188",5,"  Saw it at Texas Station in Las Vegad. It was one of the best movies I have seen in years. I almost didn't go because of the low Tomatometer score but I am so glad I did. Such a difference between their rating and how much I enjoyed the film is hard to believe."
"189",1.5,"  As a catholic, there are no problems or issues with the story elements and plot details since it was based on the story of the Bible but how it flaws is the depicting and storytelling of the story and also the inaccurate script and writing of the characters. It's lacking the characters' purpose and roles to the film."
"190",5,"  Great portrayal of Paul and Luke in their latter years of ministry. Oliver Martinez also was outstanding in his role as procurator. The message of Jesus Christ is beautifully shared."
"191",5,"  I liked it..not cheesy"
"192",3,"  Look, I'm a Christian, and I just watched the film. I was excited to see it especially after hearing Jim Caviezel talk at SLS2018. Despite this, I could not help being disappointed by the movie. I was expecting a full retelling of the story of St. Paul's life, but all we got was a brief story about his last days. I was hoping for more of a Biblical epic. If you want to see more Christian films in theaters, go see it, however it comes nowhere near great Christian classics like A Man for All Seasons, Silence, or The Ten Commandments."
"193",5,"  Powerful Movie - very well done! Historically accurate- great script and acting! Must see!"
"194",5,"  Great acting, very well directed."
"195",5,"  Absolutely incredible!!"
"196",5,"  Must see!!!Very encouraging to be a Christian in today's modern world Viva Cristo Rey!"
"197",2.5,"  I can see how a faithful person would enjoy this movie and find tremendous meaning from it. But for anyone else this movie will be a bit of a bore. I thought this movie would be more of a historical drama of Paul's life and perhaps Luke as well. The performance of the actors was excellent I would gladly stipulate. I wouldn't see this again."
"198",5,"  This movie was amazing!"
"199",5,"  A MUCH NEEDED MESSAGE FOR ALL TIME - LOVE"
"200",5,"  This movie was good from the first until the last: Very moving film. i think most people will be glad they saw it."
"201",5,"  Well done. Moving. Powerful. - My husband and I both loved it."
"202",5,"  Well done, fictionalized account of Paul's last days. Caviezel does a solid job as Luke, Martinez is really good as the Roman Prison Commander and Antonia Campbell Hughes turns in a solid performance as his wife. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that Priscilla and Aquila as well as the others in hiding struggle with their decisions, there is no *magic* solution and some turn aside. Very well done film."
"203",5,"  Great movie! Very moving."
"204",5,"  Definitely planning to see this movie and gather many friends to join me. Jim Caviezel is a fabulous actor, who needs more recognition. Go!"
"205",2,"  Very slow, but most of all, it is mostly fictional; not based on the book of Acts."
"206",4.5,"  A beautiful movie from start to finish. Truly shows that love is stronger than evil. Please go!"
"207",5,"  Really well done movie, dedicated to those who still face persecution for their faith today, and really honestly portrays the message that ""love is the only way"" without being preachy or sanctimonious. See it!"
"208",5,"  Loved the movie. Enjoyed seeing the life of Paul during his imprisonment. Well done and acting superb."
"209",5,"  Great movie for all!"
"210",5,"  Excellent movie. Caught the first showing this morning. Ignore the left-leaning Hollywood critics. This movie is very well-done and is true to text. Inspirational and moving. I would not expect non-believers to ""get it"", but really it is a good movie for all. Would Paul be willing to suffer such things for a lie? No way. This movie does an excellent job showing what the apostles experienced for Christ."
"211",5,"  Wow, I wonder if most of the critics even watched the film. This film is the standard bearer to which all faith-based films should aspire. It is artfully made and spiritually rich. The acting is inspiring, the script is superb. Andrew Hyatt has a way of slowing his audience down so they can reflect on the deep implications of the scene. Like with most Christian films, the critics get it wrong. This movie is easily the best Christian film to be made since the Passion of the Christ."
"212",5,"  A beautifully set and acted movie about a changed man. The story in Paul, Apostle of Christ is compelling and moving. How can man who once persecuted and killed Christians become one of the most important leaders in the history of the Christian church? In this film it's evident how Paul's encounter with Christ changed his life. It's a very relevant message for today because we live in a world that says, you are what you do. A world with no mercy, no forgiveness. Paul goes through a very human struggle, wrestling with his past, but the film shows how faith can allow you to change and that in order to love, Someone needs to first love you and embrace all of you. Even your past."
"213",5,"  Absolutely beautiful! I am still crying - probably will be forever. This movie moved me like nothing else has in a long time."
"214",5,"  It's ashamed that people still mock our Lord for he is good. Jim Caviezel that served the Lord with all his heart is being condemned in Hollywood for taking the biggest role of his life. The Lord knows who is good and who served him with no question. Hollywood may shut the door on Jim Caviezel but the Lords heavenly kingdom welcomes him with open arms. God Bless you Jim Caviezel."
"215",5,"  Paul is one of my favorite saints and apostles. I am humbled that I travelled the places especially Italy and Greece where he evangelized during his lifetime here on earth.After I have read the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles of Paul now this is a physical and visual story of it. May the Good Lord bless and guide these people who worked so hard to deliver these important messages for deeper foundation and knowledge of our faith in Christ. For God's greater glory!"
"216",5,"  As an Elect going into the Church I'm thankful for seeing this movie and thought it was great. I'll be going again to see it."
"217",5,"  The Apostle Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, wrote these words in Romans 1:16-17, ""For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes...For in it, the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous shall live by faith.'""Take an hour. Read the book of Romans. See the need of God's righteousness (1:18-3:20). See the provision for God's righteousness (3:21-5:21). See the demonstration of God's righteousness (6:1-8:39)...AND MORE."

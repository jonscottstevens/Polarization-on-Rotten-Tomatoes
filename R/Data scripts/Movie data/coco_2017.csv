"1",3.5,"  The movie was cute, but I don't think it's one of the best Pixar movies. Still a good watch, but I'm in no rush to watch it again soon"
"2",4.5,"  Nothing short of spectacular."
"3",5,"  Excellent movie. Amazing soundtrack."
"4",3.5,"  Generally not a fan of animated movies of the last few years as it seems that story telling and art have taken a backseat to political correctness. Not so with . Perhaps Disney and Pixar have learned their lesson. In fact, what I though going to be an extremely political movie, I was pleasantly surprised at the story telling. As someone watching aging grandparents descend into Alzheimers and dementia the story pulled hard at the heart strings. A good story and beautifully animated."
"5",5,"  This is easily one of my favorite animated movies ever. Pixar has blown me away with a lot of their movies such as Inside Out and Wall-E but this one blows them away in my mind. It is beautifully animated, has amazing characters, great performances, an amazing story, and fantastic songs. Their isn't a single problem I have with this movie and if you haven't seen it I'm telling you know you will cry and you will love this movie."
"6",5,"  this movie is very inspirational have unique twist which you can never imagine in a short period of thinking.The music and the characters purposes to the main character is very astonishing."
"7",3.5,"  Cute movie with a predictable story; however, music was superb."
"8",4.5,"  Absolutely wonderful family film with amazing animation and sound quality! It sheds a spectacular spot light on Latino culture and family values, while still having a thrilling mystery behind it."
"9",5,"  Coco Montrese, in the challenge we were raised from the dead, but on the runway your Latino blood was muy caliente. You're safe.COCOSeldom does a movie inspire me and propel me to what's best in filmmaking. Coco is one of those rare films you watch that become an instant classic. And yes, the lustful visuals and the upbeat and melodic songs are a great part of the experience but what makes this movie great, is its emotional sincerity, expertly complemented by Giacchino'a score. It's clear that this movie was based around a simple premise and a love for telling stories. And when that happens, everything else is so much easier. What Coco does fantastically and what so many movies fail to do is building a connective tissue that amounts to something greater than the movie itself, as if the fibres collide to do movie magic. When we reach the climax, it feels so earned because it's simple and because it's based on sincerity. Yes, the driving force of Coco comes from the beautifully apparent simplicity in its storytelling. It's a movie that is both a stunning visual spectacle and a touching piece of art. Also, in a time when racial segregation repeats its cycle of power, it's unusually brave to have an American studio make such a radiant homage to that culture, taking the pre-emptive measures for it to be an honour, not a steal. It comes as a surprise to nobody when I say that this film will leave you emotional (granted you belong to the human race). It's uncontrollable, it's within you to be moved when you have accompanied a character and watch the climax unfold and feel like you have earned the right to cry. And normally climaxes are huge and loud but Coco keeps it simple and quiet as moments that really strike a chord often are. What's also not so common is the movie's thematic lines, as you can't help to find incredibly brave that betrayal, murder and death are topics that the movie delves in profusely (yet never tackily). In the year in which Inside Out was release, that was, hands down, my favourite movie of the year. And, damn you Pixar, it will probably be again this year. At the end of the day, you sometimes go to the movies expecting a certain familiarity, something that you can rely on. Coco feels just like coming back to a loving home, it has the sweet scent of your grandmother's cake, it's as cosy as your childhood bedroom and it reminds us of the reason we keep coming back to these movies: to feel the warmth of the purest form of cinema."

"17",5,"  So. Much. Dust. in the air..."
"18",5,"  Absolutely amazing and inspiring. It brought a tear to my eye"
"19",5,"  Absolutely amazing movie, that is effective in making your cry.Somehow the most effective Disney and Pixar movies are able to push your buttons, through music, big eyes, and tugging at your heart strings.The music here is great, the depiction of Mexican culture is as accurate as it can be, the story telling is amazing, and overall this is a must must must watch."
"20",5,"  Stunning animation, a great story, and amazing music come together to make one of the greatest movies of all time. I feel that the film deserved at least a nomination for Best Picture."
"21",5,"  Stunning animation, a great story, and amazing music come together to make one of the greatest movies of all time. I feel that the film deserved at least a nomination for Best Picture."
"22",3.5,"  7/10 nice but sloooow"
"23",5,"  I don't think I've watched a movie that's nearly as emotional as Coco. The plot is so well thought out and its portrayal of the afterlife is convincing."
"24",5,"  Honestly a beautiful movie with a true tear jerker. Animation and voice acting was amazing and honestly makes me want to learn more about the spanish culture. Probably my favorite movie from 2017 or all time."
"25",1,"  This movie totally ripped off The Book of Life movie"
"26",5,"  we need all the emotions, thanks pixars.."
"27",4.5,"  Visually stunning and deeply moving, Coco is a heartwarming and striking depiction of Mexican culture and the importance of family."
"28",4,"  Coco's an amazing story about culture, family, life and death and a kid who will stop at nothing until he completes his dream. The rich animation and thoughtful story is age appropriate for all audiences and is something the whole family can enjoy together while learning valuable lessons about life."
"29",5,"  M a s t e r p i e c e !"
"30",5,"  Coco Is definitely a must watch, with beautiful visuals, tearjerking moments, especially for musicians. The story is compelling, and you're constantly rooting for the main characters. There is possibly only a couple flaws, 1 being that there are a couple plot holes that don't really make sense and certain points that they didn't get across well. But definitely, a must watch. Truly the best movie I think I've ever watched."
"31",5,"  Beautifuly drawn and perfectly running plot. One of pixar's greatest"
"32",5,"  Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), is a young boy who has a deep passion for music, despite living with a shoe-making family that despises it for causing the husband of their most important ancestor, Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach) to seemingly abandon his family. Miguel shortly discovers that the identity of his great-great grandfather could be the most famous musician in all Mexico, Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) and through a series of events he ends up in the Land of the Dead on the night of D√≠a de Muertos (The Day of the Dead) in which if he doesn't receive a blessing from one of his departed family members, he will end up dead himself. With Imelda and the rest of his departed family not willing to send him back unless he gives up music forever, Miguel is forced to team up with a smooth-talking skeleton named Hector (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal), to see if he can find Ernesto and convince him to send him back home...Although Coco isn't the first mainstream animated film to focus on Mexico's famous holiday where families come together to remember and celebrate the lives of their deceased relatives with that honor going to 2014's underrated gem Book of Life, Lee Unkrich, seven years after his outstanding debut with Toy Story 3, brings both Mexico's traditions and folklore to breathtaking life with one of the most beautiful looking films in Pixar Animation Studio's library.The Land of the Dead, while being a more modernized take on the Mexican afterlife when compared to Book of Life's fairy tale atmosphere, is stunning to look at, with the best examples being the outstanding character animation such as appealing skeletons with eyeballs and the shape-shifting alebrije creatures and the screenplays deep respect for Mexican culture which explains to audiences the importance of Mexican family traditions and the concepts of the most interesting aspects of the holiday such as ofrendas being vital for the deceased to visit the land of the living and the deep importance of being remembered.It's true that this film does contain numerous tropes present in other Pixar films, with the most obvious examples being Ratatouille and Brave, But Coco's beautiful animation, impressive voice-acting that's surprisingly not overtaken by celebrity voices when compared to other mainstream animated films, its deep respect for Mexican culture, outstanding use of music and it's willingness to address death in a positive light like the best of Tim Burton's filmography, makes this, along with 2015's Inside Out, the strongest Pixar film of the 2010's."
"33",5,"  Coco is masterfully crafted. With original songs like ""Remember Me"" (Kristen Anderson-Lopez / Robert J. Lopez) featured at several different points thoughout the feature and an original score by Michael Giacchino, both paying tribute to the traditional sound of Mexico; Coco's soundtrack doesn't just accompany the story, it is the story!"
"34",4,"  Great Writing: 2 StarsA cute movie that tugs on the old heart strings. The writing is very good, not amazing but very good. Dialog is where it lacks a little bit. The flagship song is sang in English during the movies entirety, which is a little disappointing. Great Production: 2 StarsA visually beautiful animation and fun soundtrack. Other then the city of the dead, not much else was visually captivating. As mentioned before the English songs cause it to loose authenticity."
"35",5,"  A top-five film for Pixar, Coco was a film that had a little bit of everything: family, amazing music, beautiful animation, and a story that can only be told by the folks at Disney/Pixar. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried all three times I saw it in theaters."
"36",5,"  Really beautiful and inspiring, gorgeously animated, and filled with many positive messages with a high level of maturity that even adults can watch and enjoy."
"37",4,"  Really lovely, especially considering I watched it in Spanish! Colourful, charming and right in that sweet spot of serious-yet-silly, 'Coco' tackles issues of culture, family and legacy with a relatable protagonist and a few twists.I'll have to agree with someone-I-can't-remember's analysis: it's definitely difficult to dislike."
"38",5,"  Beautiful and Elegant. Best Animation movie by far this year."
"39",5,"  ""Coco"" is the best movie in the history of Pixar."
"40",5,"  laugh out loud funny and entertaining from beginning to end"
"41",4.5,"  WOW what a great movie."
"42",4,"  I've 'nearly' cried quite a few times with films. But I can hardly recall tears actually flowing on my cheeks. Pixar has its way with sweet, tender, pristine emotion."
"43",5,"  A wonderful, WONDERFUL movie."
"44",5,"  My 2 year old's favorite movie. We watch it every day. Super cute. Surprisingly I don't get bored with it."
"45",5,"  When i see the trailer, i'm just interested with visual, just that.But this is more and more than that, it's really a masterpiece. This is a movie with very powerful message about love, about family, about dream, about passion, and how we can choose the best in life.I recommend you all to watch this movie."
"46",5,"  a very joyful movie that can make anyone smile and cry"
"47",2,"  Fun movie but I enjoyed ""Book of Life"" more"
"48",5,"  Good Films I really enjoyed it!"
"49",3.5,"  The visuals and humor are great but the story isn't that good. From undeveloped characters, to boring sequences and confusing plotlines. ""Coco"" is far from the masterpiece, critics claim it to be."
"50",3.5,"  okay.... have to admit that the plot was somehow unexpected. Then again, this movie works just fine, and I mean, just fine. Overrated in some sense perhaps?"
"51",4.5,"  Coco has taken a place in my top three favourite Pixar films and a place in my heart with it's touching story that can bring a tear to your eye. Coco is wonderfully animated with respect to the Mexican tradition. The cast is perfect for every role and the (Spoiler Alert) twist was not seen coming about Miguel's grandfather."
"52",5,"  Pixar has done it again with a movie that I can see put next to Toy Story and Finding Nemo as some of the best kids movies of the 21st century. Plot is interesting for the whole family with an interesting twist."
"53",4,"  This is not a ""light"" movie. The subject matter is pretty deep, and I will admit to crying at the end. I didn't laugh hardly at all, but there were many moments that made me feel all the feels."
"54",5,"  Fantastic movie with a very cool story with many surprises throughout. The theme of family was awesome and it was one of the best animated movies ive seen in a long time. 5/5"
"55",4.5,"  Always remember no matter what, family comes first."
"56",5,"  Excelente pelicula!. Una muestra bellisima de la cultura mexicana. Emocionante."
"57",4,"  Colorful visuals and a strong, relevant theme make this the best animated film of the year."
"58",4,"  A heartwarming tale about the importance of family, but also following your passion. During his adventure with Hector, Miguel learns it's all about staying true to yourself and not forgetting those you love. The movie took a surprising, dark twist, but I liked that it was unexpected. An inventive and creative story!"
"59",4.5,"  Stunningly gorgeous animation, beautiful visuals that leap off the screen, and a deeply affecting narrative about culture, family, life, and death, help make Lee Unkrich's newest film standout as one of Pixar's best efforts in years."
"60",3.5,"  Visually beautiful, great portrayal of the monomyth...but very ADD in all of it's twists and turns."
"61",3,"  I actually did see this movie, and every star I am giving it goes to the design of the world and characters, the music, and the way they portrayed Mexican culture. This movie is lacking in story, in my opinion. Filled with tired cliches that we've seen over and over. You got the family that just doesn't understand, you got the big misunderstanding that leads to disaster between Miguel and Hector, and you got the really nice guy that turns around is suddenly an evil monster. The villain really is my biggest problem with the movie. I wish they would put more effort into these villains. What drove him to such a drastic choice? Why did he feel like he had to do what he did to his friend? Did he have a family he wanted to take care of as well? Make him more human and relatable, please, because he's basically just the prince from Frozen at this point. The family is also terrible aside from Hector, like they are all awful and manipulative people aside from Coco and her father. Just really unlikable people."
"62",5,"  The best movie i ever seen"
"63",5,"  Great family movie! Best of 2018!"
"64",5,"  So good I have no words to describe it"
"65",5,"  Coco isn't just a fantastic Pixar movie, but its a movie that's able to tell a story with dead people and make it extremely touching. Coco is a new Pixar Classic. The chemistry with Miguel and Hector is unforgettable, the music by Michael Giacchino is great, the songs are also amazing in this movie. Animation that surpasses any Pixar movie, and emotional scenes that punch you in the gut Hard! Coco is a new masterpiece, don't judge this movie by its Day of the Dead theme, the directors are telling a beautiful story with a Mexican holiday that's so touching. Pixar, you've done it again!!"
"66",3.5,"  Pretty fun. Catchy tunes. Predictable. But I'm starting to miss a boy and girl love story."
"67",3,"  Coco has a good story with a twist and a great ending, but it does have its slow scenes and predictable moments."
"68",5,"  Coco was a AMAZING MOVIE! Made me sad when wanted to, perfect action, and beautiful design"
"69",5,"  Coco is a richly animated, heartwarming film that explores portrayals of the lands of the living and dead. The narrative follows Miguel, a young boy whose love of music changes his world in life and death. The strong presence of characters such as Hector, a man nearly forgotten in the Land of the Remembered, make the film relatable for all viewers. This is a film for all, young and old, and one sure not to be forgotten."
"70",4,"  I am not a Pixar fan. Ever since..I wanna say Cars, maybe...their films are too high concept for my liking, filled with all sorts of baffling internal logic that serves the purpose of the story and whatever heavy handed lesson they are trying to peddle, but completely destroys my suspension of disbelief. Coco, then, is a welcome surprise because it (like all of the Pixars I *do* like) it tells a relatively straightforward story and allows its themes to reveal themselves naturally, in a way that does not feel forced. Inside Out, I'm looking at you. It's also very much a take off of Wizard of Oz, and has the visuals to bolster that lofty comparison."
"71",4.5,"  Coco is one of Disney and Pixar's greatest movies and a significant improvement over some of the mixed films of the past few years. The movie focuses on a young Mexican boy named Miguel who slowly discovers a passion for music, but is not able to pursue this dream due to his family forbidding the practice. They do not tell him why, except for the fact that it is a curse. Miguel eventually gets transported to the afterlife where he visits many of his ancestors and he begins his slow journey towards solving his family mystery and passion for music. The story is well written and executed well in this adventure. The visuals are stunning and Pixar continues to lead the way in regards to animated films. The colours are vibrant and help project the world as magical and breathtaking. The music is also enjoyable with tons of catchy songs throughout. Family serves as the central theme of the film and it delivers important messages on this front. There are some predictable storylines during the latter half of the film, but these can easily be forgiven by the heartfelt messages and vibrant and joyful world being portrayed. Overall, Coco is a very enjoyable film for any movie goer, portraying a fun and engaging world, with important messages and catchy songs."
"72",3.5,"  Nothing like a good cry during a kid's cartoon movie."
"73",5,"  it is the best what i seen in 2018"
"74",3,"  The obvious FORESHADOWING combined with some obvious cliches make this film Extremely predictable, One of the most absurd examples is when a character confirms being a murderer by making a movie scene out of it: that's so idiotic.There are also several contradictions and events that don't make sense; the guitar is stolen (a second time) and there is no repercussion at all, some of the characters have bipolar moodswings for lack of a better word, which is partially because this film struggles to SEPARATE comedy from drama, and the villain being literally forgotten; how did that happen so easily? (Spoiler Warning) I didn't want to mention the similar Fox film Book of Life: but I actually do because there are too many similarities to ignore. I am aware of the Day-of-the-dead themes, the big issue is the writing is similar; kid wants to break family tradition to be a guitarist, romance built upon music INTERRUPTED by a cheating ASSASSIN who uses poison, the dead family team up to fight the villain, a grandma dies during the film, the popular guy is revealed to be a fraud. these are very specific SIMILARITIES, but at least it's not an obvious cut-and-paste (kimba the white lion).With that said, it's not a bad film and it does indeed have emotional moments and a good ending. I just expected more from a film this over-hyped.but don't expect me to think that Grandma Elena turned over a new leaf somehow: no way she changed and no way am i going to show sympathy to that hag."
"75",5,"  It is the first movie i have to give a socre in this page, it made cry a lot as I did not before. I would like to give a better opinion but I would not find the correct words #COCO"
"76",5,"  This touching movie. This is one movie i much recommend watching. Very heartwarming."
"77",5,"  It was a fantastic movie best Iseen so far"
"78",1,"  If this movie's main job was to make you cry, I would have given it a 10/5 stars. But as a movie only, it sucked. And UNFORTUNATELY Pixar must battle of the law of expectation. I was hoping this movie would be as good, as charming, as wonderful as Pixar's earlier stuff. It's just plain not. And even when not comparing this movie to Pixar's earlier work, this movie still wasn't very good. The boy is not charming enough. The laughs aren't funny enough. The story isn't inspiring enough. The plot isn't captivating enough. Kids will of course like this ok. But overall, it's just not worth the reviews it got, plain and simple. Watch at your own risk."
"79",5,"  Saw this on a plane and found myself totally absorbed andTouched by this movie. It's a must see for anyoneWhose lost someone they love."
"80",3.5,"  Pixar has done it gain with another animated masterpiece but although the world created, the story told, and the characters developed, Coco fails to reach legendary status like some other Pixar classics we know."
"81",4,"  One of the only movies that has made me cry."
"82",5,"  I cried in the first five minutes. It's a true adventure without being pandering. Emotional without being melodramatic. Funny without being cheesy. Fantastic!!!"
"83",5,"  A Huge Amount of Good Feeling"
"84",4,"  Coco is by all means a large serving of heartfelt suitition with fun that will have you singing without even knowing, absolutely amazing."
"85",2,"  Despite being a Book of Life rip-off, theme wise, it does a reasonable job of telling a story. Just don't expect it to be half as light or funny as BoL and you'll be OK."
"86",5,"  A beautiful, emotional and charming movie which has swiftly become my favourite Pixar movie ever! The songs are fun, the vistas are incredible - this is a new peak of animation, and Lee Unkrich has cemented himself as my favourite animated director with my top two films ever."
"87",4,"  Well, Pixar have done it again. Colourful, vibrant and gorgeous animation combined with a touching story (although rather predictable and perhaps a little saccharine, at times) makes this another wonderful edition to the Studio's catalogue of ever-growing hits. It not only handles big topics such as life and death with sensitivity and care, getting its message across in a family-friendly way, but manages to do it whilst also being an entertaining, emotional and culturally sensitive love letter to Mexico and its traditions. It isn't Pixar's best work, but it's pretty great, nonetheless."
"88",4.5,"  One of the best animation film of 2017."
"89",5,"  Overall an amazing movie and something I'd never get tired of seeing. I've seen this multiple times already and even from the animation alone, there's always something new to discover during the film. The plot is structured in a way that makes every puzzle piece and point of view fit together almost comically perfect. A movie that allows both kids and adults to cry over. Definitely worth seeing"
"90",5,"  Lovely scenario and story. Beautiful songs."
"91",5,"  I must have seen this movie about twenty times and still cry at the end. A wonderful storyline, amazing voice cast and perfectly touching moments throughout. This is my favourite release in years and I plan on watching it many more times yet! My two year old knows most of the songs and words and has his own guitar which he holds and sings the songs. You have to have a heart of stone to not love this!"
"92",5,"  Pixar creates yet another masterpiece with this gorgeously animated and touching movie about the importance of family and remembering those who we have lost. The plot is engaging and filled with twists and turns that are perfectly set up. It doesn't matter what age you are or what culture you are from everyone can find something in this oh so human story. If Coco fails to emotionally effect you I question your sanity"
"93",5,"  the greatest cartoon I have ever seen"
"94",5,"  No.1 Animation film of all time!!"
"95",5,"  Possibly the best offering from Pixar ever. And that is saying something."
"96",4.5,"  soon fantastic and brilliant. i can't even expel how much emotion you'll get"
"97",5,"  Absolutely amazing!"
"98",4.5,"  One of the best films ever! I absolutely loved the story and moral and I highly recommend seeing this movie."
"99",5,"  I didn't expect much when I watched this movie and there were a lot of twist and turns. It's another fast paced animated film but everything were somehow precise to the point. The story is heavily focused on the importance of family and believing on whatever you want to be. Miguel is one of those kids who still believe in that. It was an enjoyable movie, never the less. The near end of the story was heartbreaking but that's when you realized that family is very important. It's pretty much the message this movie is showing to us. Hopefully this movie is included in the upcoming video game, Kingdom Hearts 3. It seems to be an appropriate setting for the game and i wouldn't be surprised if Sora and Miguel become instant best friends since they are much alike."
"100",4,"  colorful visuals, fun story, vibrant music. and a heartwarming message at the end. Much more lighthearted in tone than Corpse Bride. My only gripe would be the forced and unneeded plot twist villain that's been done to death in prior PIXAR films like in Toy Story and UP."
"101",5,"  Un des plus beau film d'animation que j'ai pu voir"
"102",5,"  ????????????????????????"
"103",4,"  While the film begins as standard animated fare, it blossoms much like the great works of Ghibli and Disney into a glorious celebration of all things south american and fantastical. The characters are not ground breaking but their place in the world Unkrich and Molina create are fantastic, filled with emotion and a riveting story, Coco will have you laughing, crying and tapping your feet to this fresh but familiar animation."
"104",5,"  Enjoyable film, good fun, loveable characters, unpredictable and funny plot line with a humorous and good moral message. Recommend! it's deserves attention !"
"105",5,"  love this movie this is the best movie.."
"106",5,"  This was a really good movie i recommend seeing it either in theaters or buying it from YouTube,FandangoNOW or where ever you buy movies online. I love the Mexican Culture in this movie it really gave me a insight on what it is like in Spanish Countries on the Day of the Dead."
"107",5,"  Pixars best work to date."
"108",5,"  a movie that will make you cry like a child."
"109",3,"  Oscar winner for best animation is an odd movi\e. Most of the movie is spent where all his ancestors are dead (day of the Daed) but are clothed and made up as if they were alive. Very oddGorgeous film and nice music (Oscar for best song)."
"110",5,"  Ufff excelente pelicula"
"111",5,"  It was great. My favorite part was how the guitar playing was accurate."
"112",5,"  movie MAKES A WAVE OF EMOTIONS AND Tears. its very very good!"
"113",5,"  SPECTACULAR production. As a hispanic american, i really appreciated the details that were accurately depicted in regards to the mexican culture. The STORYLINE was unique, and The excitement kept me on my toes the ENtire Film."
"114",5,"  Pixar has done it again! Amazing!"
"115",5,"  this is a very touching story, get ready to cry"
"116",5,"  Mamacita!!! The movie, that is going to test the amount of water in your eyes. Loved it"
"117",5,"  One of the best Pixar films of all time. this film is proof that hollywood can still make original films (if it wants to)."
"118",5,"  Such a wonderful celebration of family love. so heartwarming."
"119",4,"  Death has never before been so aliveMiguel, an aspiring musician kid, runs around between colorful Mexican alleys with folkloric varieties of footwear, handmade by his family, who considers shoemaking business as the absolute job of each congener from generation to generation. Sadly, all his dreams will be interrupted by the unshakable family aversion to any minimum melody coming from an instrument; music has been radically abolished as a result of a fatal event of the past. Confused, brimming with different future plans and dangerously wrathful by the demands of his family, Miguel will be involved in a fantastic adventure, impressively deep, against time by festive landscapes of an enigmatic second dimension, one in which the deceased beings reside, those who remain semi-alive thanks to the memories of the living humans.Without any remorse, it could be said that the last Walt Disney Animation Studios & Pixar Animation Studios big bet took place almost one year ago with ""Moana"" by Ron Clements and John Musker, overlooking Brian Fee's irregular directional debut in summer flick ""Cars 3."" Almost 365 days of waiting provoked that the expectations to see the new original idea of the perfectionist studio were boosted without a break, and as they were unlocking fine details about the work, the audience demands got harder disproportionately. Needless to say, when the prior film raises the bar at a fairly high level, expectations embrace a difficult range of overcoming, the criteria for reviewing this audiovisual work were hardened in a way that it would only be considered really good if only meet the needs of the toughest public. To the delight of everybody, the newest incursion in animation genre by Disney doesn't simply meet the demands before a damn good-looking visual section, the best part comes from the charm of its characters and the substantial plot proposal that can be a long subject of debate and analysis.Computer animation has a host of genuinely creative possibilities. Over the years, thousands of silver screens have projected hundreds of stories which reflect the diversity of ideas and thoughts that can be extracted from a human mind. Within this interminable catalogue of film opportunities, the vast range of global cultures shines by itself in the visual field and despite the studio has tried to circumscribe most of its films in American environments, also gave free rein the screenwriters, resulting in small gems as ""Mulan"", ""Aladdin"" and, now ""Coco"".Oscar-winner Lee Unkrich and Seattle Film Critics Award-winner Adrian Molina seem to be consolidated as the kings of the present-day animation because, through the ""hypothetical"" inequality of years working in the field, they have achieved, in a magnificent way, to synthesize the characteristics with greater sensitivity and affinity from their previous works to use them in a plausible co-direction that allows the film to be what it is. Likewise, it was an outstanding job what they did with the general draft or/and the original story that plays a vital role for the success of the idea, in which it's possible to catch respectful and fresh reference parallelisms to certain functional aspects present in prior flicks such as the independence representation from ""Finding Nemo"", the overcoming of a specific problem in a gracefully dynamic way from ""Monsters, Inc"", and, of course, the most perceptible, an emotional and severe final message coming together harsh reality from ""Toy Story 3."" Additional to the aforementioned two directors-screenwriters, names of the caliber of Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich stand out in the writing for their prestige and recognition in the company, leaving, as a result, an Aldrich-Molina explosive mix that provokes the correct working of the powerhouse script. Encompassing or synthesizing the valuable teachings of this movie is an impossible task, given that it drops them according to how the facts are happening, however, it's possible to notice edifying advises geared the unstoppable chase for a dream, responsibility that this act requires, love of and for the family, the reminder that evil still is out there waiting for an affable figure, probity, humility, the power of goodness and, of course, death. The latter subject is clearly the central concept with which the film manages to surpass some barriers, while at the same time, it's the one entailing a harder complexity. Although with the advent of modern ideologies and, consequently, relegation of the more traditional customs, this phenomenon has been shown a considerable decline, over the years, a blacklist on utmost-importance-but-sensitive-treatment subjects has been in the pipeline, themes that nobody dares to address, a series of matters which, for different reasons, are kept under an invisible but practicable veto by studio blockbusters and medium-budget movies, which prefer to avoid them because of the labile and perilous result that would mean a false step; taboos or not, these subjects would mean for any major film studio a daring position of ""all or nothing."" Homosexuality, political divisions, massive attacks or tragic events, social conjunctures, crude indecent language, explicit violence, euthanasia, suicide or murder compose a long list from which no one mentions. Now, if for an adult mind is really cumbersome to digest films of this kind, it's understandable that a young mind wouldn't endure even one-half of this content. However, in the case of this animated feature film, death, an openly polarizing subject at present, has got a subtle, clever treatment in order to capture, in a fantastic way, the truth hiding the loss of a loved one, using accessible analogies which stir up a proactive unique masterclass in core plot idea development. About this, the whole film moves with a comfortable margin among corny drama and circumstantial comical situations that achieve, within all that unreal and hopeful context, reflect difficult and pure reality, leaning, with respect, in the ideal Mexican holiday that fits perfectly with the leitmotiv. It's clear that what makes easier the excellent final cut is the charisma and the particular essence of the story and its characters, they are pawns serving as a bridge between message and audience. And, in addition to the fundamental role played by screenwriters, the subsequent movie weight lies in the vocal skills of actors, they must transmit a set of emotions and sensations through sound, through voice. Among the agglomerate of the cast, as well as the crew, unequivocally Latin names shine, which is its second greatest strong point: the opening to a new original culture. Anthony Gonzalez, Benjamin Bratt, Jaime Camil, Ana Ofelia MurguÌa and ""Mozart in the Jungle"" actor Gael Garc√≠a Bernal lead the mission of lifting their homeland up, their traditions, their voices, their needs, and now is the perfect time for a movie like this, one in which the Mexican territory is the setting for action; it must be heard not only by American ears but by everyone in this world, as an example of moving on, friendship, union; It is no secret that between country and country, hostile walls have been erected, for the moment ""supposed"", on economic, political and social relations; the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan has stoked a dangerous flame of egocentricity and intolerance that threatens the lives of thousands of either legal or illegal inmigrant, and although it's a really serious bussines, it's applaudable that from an artistic scenario begin to give the first hopeful blows to break a full-hatred wall down. And ""Coco"", even though its story has nothing to do with this complicated conflict at first glance, manages to raise a short but grateful criticism. To sum it all up, the film works in many ways, keeps strong messages for all ages, each spectator can extract whatever it wants from an adventure that is consolidated as the animated motion picture of the year.Creatively, the film uses its tools in a way that exhibits the meticulous quality showed in the Pixar works. It follows the patterns of introduction and development evidenced in previous works, and although the most assiduous film buffs can feel repetitive this prototype, it's always estimable the effort to dodge the traditional through stories that transcend narrative barriers, unequivocally, through emotional scripts. While the first two acts are a complete enjoyment, the highlight is reserved for the final part because ""Coco"" has the luxury of having the second more emotionally disturbing and sentimentally dramatic climax in an animated film of the 21st century, only behind, no doubt, ""Toy Story 3"". It's overwhelming the set of emotions that an audiovisual extremely glorious moment can convey audience, one that has been fire engraved in the annals of cinema, one that will ensure the presence of hankies. Although for many spectators can feel it anticlimactic and abrupt, this ending combines, perfectly, with the atmosphere of the narrative, revealing vigor and longevity that Disney maintains to date.The visual section is a whole other story. After a beautiful graphic simplicity coming from ""Cars 3"", the studio goes back roots and decides to bet on sharply-meticulous landscapes again, using as tools bright colors, colorful textures and confections that are going to leave you open-mouthed, maybe, that's why many film attendees come to the theaters with each new release, they're aware of the dimensions of tidiness and the labor demands that the company portrays through its continuous masterpieces. In the same way, the sound aspect excels in counted periods, however, in which it succeeds, it does it in an unbeatable way. Although it does not reach near-perfect scores as Lin-Manuel Miranda's melodies for ""Moana"" or Randy Newman's for ""Toy Story"", the film extracts what can most of these in the drama set-pieces, undoubtedly highlighting ""Remember Me"" by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, which climatizes the most powerful emotional moment in the movie. ""Coco"" by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina condenses a wide range of American cinema's strangeness and traditional elements, delivering the animated audiovisual work of the year par excellence. This enjoyable and deeply touching Magnum opus has reserved a gold place in the most prestigious movie awards, however, beyond critic acclaims or awards, its creators must feel fully fortunate that their film has gained a little piece of memory and love in the heads and hearts of millions and millions of people, perhaps, just like I did. We can breathe a sigh of relief, Disney pics keep to signify learning pillars for the growth of many people."
"120",4,"  Coco is a beautiful film capturing every true to life element of family and emotion of mexican culture and love for others. Though losing itself in the third ""villain"" act, the message that is continuously spread out throughout the film is the saving grace."
"121",4.5,"  Heart warming, inspiring and one of a kind. Great family friendly movie"
"122",5,"  A beautiful movie that shows the importance of family and the power of memories. Amazing music and beautiful colors all throughout the film. It stands among the best of the best of not just Pixar, but all animated movies."
"123",5,"  A brand new unknown cast, beautiful music and animation, and an incredibly enriched story line really make this movie a work of art. Coco has some incredible themes presented regarding life, death and family with the backdrop of dia de los muertos. amazing work! truly loved this film."
"124",5,"  This was one of the best movies i have seen in a Very long time it truly makes you be proud of being Mexican i loved it bedt movie Definetly reccomend this movie"
"125",5,"  An absolute STUNNING piece of cinema. Pixar have outdone themselves again with this epic movie. I mean, you can see the cheek hairs on miguel's face for gods sake! Every bit of detail, objects rendered, lighting, music all so lovingly created by these geniuses. Not so much a kids movie but ending will bring you to tears!Bit disappointed pixar didnt have a ""Short"" at the start of this movie like they USUALLY do. Still 100% awesome movie and a must watch before it leaves the cinema!"
"126",5,"  LOVED THIS. Being Hispanic, this brought me to tears. Highly recommended, the visuals are stunning"
"127",4,"  Funny, emotional and graphically beautiful."
"128",5,"  Coco is heart warming and beautiful. With its wonderfully crafted worlds, and characters that are as grounded and fantastic as the story they reside in, this film shows us just how fantastic cinema can be. Human connection is not lost, not with stories like this."
"129",4.5,"  This was a great movie. Adults and kids alike will enjoy aspects of it. I loved the emphasis on the importance of family."
"130",5,"  I love this movie! Just everything about it. Just Great!"
"131",5,"  It's been exactly 2 months since the premiere of COCO in my country, Argentina, and I'm still surprised every time I see it. Let's start talking about the story defining it with a single word: unique. unique with its characters, the relationships between them, the twists that history has that, despite being predictable (except for the unexpected twist of the movie's climax) is still a story that catches you and is one of the most Exciting and sensitive that I have seen in my life. I also love that when you talk about life after death, you never talk about a religion, I still present it as something that we should all do: remember all the people who have made our family and also those who have achieved a positive change in our livesWith respect to animation, there are only two words to describe it: visually beautiful. The characters, the world of the dead, the shadows, the contrasts, the movements, the small details, like the vibration of the strings on Miguel's guitar, are perfectly made without encountering the slightest error. We can also see the many Easter eggs we can see in the movie: the luxo ball, the poster of the incredible, the toy story characters and looking for nemo (which appear as toys and alebrijes), among other things.Finally, I will finish with the music talking about the unique and incomparable Michael Giachino. Achievement mix the Mexican music with the Hollywood production in a spectacular way. Achieve creates a climate both to make us laugh and make us cry. And we were left speechless with the songs of the movie like ""Recuerdame"", ""un loco"", ""juanita"", among others.The truth is that I take my hat off with Pixar because every movie they make makes us surprise. I also applaud them after taking 6 years to make this movie to be a great representation of the Day of the Dead of Mexico and the Mexicans received it in such a good way that it became the highest grossing film in its history. I hope you continue to surprise us and give us those messages so essential in the present in which we live as ""The family is first"" ""follow your dreams"" and ""seize your moment"""
"132",4.5,"  This was a fun, touching movie with some great story telling - everything you'd expect from Pixar. I was especially impressed with how they used the main song in a variety of different ways. There's some brilliant musical stuff in this movie.You'll laught, you'll cry, you'll see stunning visuals, and the kids will be entertained."
"133",5,"  A very sweet and touching movie. Pixar has a winner!"
"134",5,"  Completely Amazing! Possibly my FAVORITE film of all time!"
"135",5,"  Loved it!! It warmed my heart and left the theatre feeling happy. Rich in colors, good story, lots of good values and humour!!! A little jewel, a must see!!!!"
"136",4.5,"  Wonderful film with a great story, highly recommend"
"137",4.5,"  Pixar made it again. I waited for this film since it is another piece of art of pixar work. Also, I, as a Mexican person, thought it would be great to see some of my culture on it. It did not disappoint me. The film itself is great, the way that Pixar tells the story like only they can do it. All the background and the Mexico town is amazing, something you will really see in Mexico cities. I loved the way they portray the whole family concept (like in real life mexican families) and all the little basic details (the streets, the house back yard, the words used, the clothes, persons physical, etc). In other way, I liked how they mixed all this their way. At the beginning it really does not feel like a pixar movie (just because of the movie theme), When Miguel enters the world of the dead, it hits you and really think ""ok, this is some pixar work of art"". This movie will really have to be in your ""crying movies"" list. It makes you remember the importance of the familia. I appreciate how pixar always puts a lot of effort on investigating the main theme of their movies in order to make it 100% credible, and they did it again in Coco. I can not list it as my #1 Pixar movie, since I think they have made real classics, however, this is nothing disappointing and I think that this film has everything (story, music, effort on their characters, good animations and amazing colors, voice acting is great). You can really feel the love put in the movie."
"138",5,"  I want to see it waaaa"
"139",5,"  wow! this movie a visual spectacle of magnificent proportions!! so proud of seeing this movie representing my Latino community!"
"140",5,"  If you want to see Coco, have a packet of tissues ready, because if you have a soul you'll cry at this film's ending."
"141",5,"  Absolutely loved it!!! made me cry and its very relatable. they did an awesome job portraying dia de los muertos"
"142",4,"  Great MOVIE! REally made me cry and remind me the value of family."
"143",5,"  this movie was Amazing!!!! Family love. Dont forget love and im cry . Beautiful movie ! Herm0sa!!! Pelicula amor fiesta TRAdiciones. Asi debe ser la vida amor. No divisionViva MEXICO ????????????????????????????????????"
"144",5,"  Everything you'd expect from another disney and pixar animated flick. WAs impressed by the great twist at the end as well as it's ability to hit me emotionally. PERFORMANCES were perfecto."
"145",5,"  I LOVE THIS MOVIE the story line is beautiful and thoughtful and the art is incredibly well done with rich CO LOURS and intricate detail, the sound score is the best on any animated movie i've seen."
"146",3,"  Candy floss sentiment that's a nice film to watch with kids and also has enough to keep adults mildly entertained."
"147",4.5,"  Music is life. ""Coco"" brilliantly balances the essence of music with the inevitability of death & creates something funny, original & magical. Once again, Pixar delivers an emotional roller-coaster of a film.(Updated from 04/03/2018)"
"148",0.5,"  Terrible , the most predictable movie of all time , almost puked on my TV ..."
"149",5,"  Visually and musically stunning, with great cultural and family values."
"150",3,"  Coco is a nice movie, but it feels like Disney trying to do Pixar rather than Pixar being Pixar. It's missing the heart & humor found in early Pixar movies and ends up being fairly bland. Most of the songs are forgettable, as well, which is strange since this movie is all about music and not forgetting things. At least Coco is slightly better than Book of Life."
"151",5,"  A visually stunning masterpiece!!"
"152",5,"  To me, the trailer made it feel like a regular animated movie with constant skeleton jokes. After watching it, however, I was amazed by the spectacular animation, the charming characters and the well placed plot twists. No critiques at all. A beautiful and fun movie."
"153",5,"  So heart touching <3"
"154",4,"  a wonderfully charming family movie that will have sentimental folks reaching for the tissue box. as someone who has never really investigated what the DAY OF THE DEAD is about, this is a nice into. this movie evolves digital animation even further (just when you think the genre has reached it's full potential). character movements and facial expression - though cartoon - seem to express a sophisticated level of subtle movements, making COCO both a visual treat to go with the heartwarming story.my money is on COCO landing an OSCAR."
"155",4,"  Pretty cute, reminded me of Book of Life. I like both movies but do prefer Book of Life more"
"156",5,"  We watched this as a family (2 and 3 year old). We all loved it, and I cried buckets. It was funny, sweet and heart-warming, my favourite kids film since Frozen"
"157",5,"  I have a new Pixar favorite. Well done, Disney!"
"158",5,"  Excellent movie. The entire family enjoyed it."
"159",5,"  Not your usual Pixar movie but very emotional. Instant classic."
"160",4.5,"  Thanks to this film's extremely understandable storytelling, creative narrating and emotional script and also great smooth sequence pasting. I can't help crying to sleep"
"161",5,"  Another excellent movie from Pixar!! It's amazing on how they chose to make a film with some Hispanic culture in it. That's what made this movie unique and so beautiful besides the story being so great. It's always a pleasure to see a Disney movie that's very different from the others. I loved it so freaking much!!!!!!"
"162",4,"  Visually rich and layered with important themes on life and death as well as an interesting exploration into Mexican culture. It's got its cliche moments but you don't expect Pixar to stray far from those anyways."
"163",5,"  What a great movie! Seriously!!"
"164",3,"  Just cause it's a kids movie that doesn't suck doesn't mean it's all that great. It's fine. But please, lower the hype."
"165",5,"  Some people might not appreciate the ""Day of the Dead"" perspective, but it has a good story and lesson for kids. It sure held my 5-year-old grandson's attention.We'll be buying it...it's a keeper that will be watched again."
"166",4,"  Really well done and quite an interesting take on Dia de Muertos. It may not be Pixar's best, but it has a heartfelt story with stunning visuals."
"167",4.5,"  While I would not call Coco a perfect Pixar movie (that honor goes to The Incredibles) it is beautiful, moving, and almost certain to bring a tear to your eye. The timing is a bit abrupt, the plot is kind of predictable, and I'd say it could have used a lot more fun and adventure, but the vibrant colors and honest love of family are both big wins."
"168",5,"  Wow you know what this is a masterpiece of a film period. Coco is one of the most beautiful and truly amazing animated film of all time I mean this was so much better then the book of life. The reason why this film is so good is that it has a very powerful message and that message is never forget about your family because family comes first and I love that message plus the visuals in the film where fantastic and beautiful I was wow with that and it made me cry twice thats how good the film was and freakin love it so. Overall Coco was the most beautiful and truly a masterpiece of a animated film with heart and a really deep and powerful message that everyone will love and as a Latino myself I fucking love it and my family too. Well done Disney and Pixar you guys done it again with your films but this one is your best one yet and you know what you guys nail it big time and this film is a truly a masterpiece I hope this film wins the Oscar because this film deserve it big time. Good job and well done best animated film ever and the best of 2017 last year love sooo much. And always remember your family always."
"169",5,"  Wonderful movie. Pairs themes that are critical with Mexican culture, with a touching tale of forgiveness and discovering the true meaning of family."
"170",5,"  The movie was awesome. It was the best since Zootopia . It was a fun and awesome journey with Miguel. It is my #1. Although I had some suprised moments and thats has never happened before and it is emotional, and a laugh out loud helluva great movie."
"171",4.5,"  I saw it was Disney and Pixar, I heard good things about it, I had no doubts I will enjoy this, and boy I did."
"172",4,"  Not Pixar's best but it was entertaining"
"173",5,"  Saw this movie in English and Spanish, I loved it so much but in Spanish sounds a lot better than English. Pixar did such amazing job and put in a lot of hard work and creativity into COCO??"
"174",5,"  Such an amazing movie. As a mexican, it fills me with pride. You blew it out of the water this time Disney!!!!!!!!!!"
"175",5,"  Awesome. That's all."
"176",4.5,"  Fantastic movie. Easily will win Best Animated Feature. Pixar does it again. #9 on my Top 10 of the year. Everything about this movie is good."
"177",1,"  For some reason when I was watching Coco it never had A huge impact on me. I think it might have been the weird plot."
"178",5,"  This movie is amazing! It shows the importance of family while incorporating it with Mexican culture and surprising narrative twists"
"179",4.5,"  Lovely story, lovely animation and soothing music. Another beautiful thought process of life after death. Fantastic!!"
"180",5,"  I cried!! It was sooo good"
"181",5,"  Beautifully made, needed a tissue at the end, Pixar knows how to connect with your emotions. Fun seeing the Pizza Rocket truck again."
"182",4,"  Despite the predictable beats, there is hidden complexity in the narrative. Also, this is one of Pixar's most visually rich efforts."
"183",5,"  What a wonderful film."
"184",5,"  Vibrant, heart-warming and tear-jerking. Loved it!"
"185",4,"  Gorgeous and thought-provoking..."
"186",4,"  I'm going to be honest. At first, I was dreading this film. I had seen and greatly enjoyed Book of Life by Jorge Gutierrez previously, and knew his story of pitching his film about Day of the Dead to several studios for 13 years only for them all to reject it or want to drastically change it beyond recognition. They had told him, no one wants to see a film about Mexican culture. Fortunately, not only was his movie given a chance to be made, he had creative control which meant he could be true to his vision and culture. Seeing the similarities between Book of Life and Coco in Coco's first trailer led me to the impression Disney Pixar was trying to ride on the critical and financial success of Book of Life by coming up with their own version. But for the benefit of the doubt, and hearing that Jorge gave this film his blessing, I decided to give Coco a chance. And I am happy I did. What I expected to be mere pandering turned out to be a beautiful story with wonderful music, great (inside) humor, and visual marvels that sincerely pays homage to Mexican culture. And if you have seen Book of Life, yes the similarities are there but Coco does have its own distinct story, and now we have two great animated films around Day of the Dead! Next step, a Latin Superhero or Superheroine!"
"187",5,"  The best animated film i have seen in the last few years. It was simply amazing. Beautiful story and extremely well done. It deservers an Oscar."
"188",4.5,"  One of Disney/Pixar's most satisfying films. The animation is colorful and imaginative. I love how the story balances family values with a more thoughtful look at our existence."
"189",1.5,"  A pIxar rip off of the Book of Life and poorly executed at that."
"190",5,"  Cinematic perfection. Every cord strung right. Disney wows again."
"191",4,"  Buena pelÌcula, progresi√≥n r√°pida y entretenida"
"192",5,"  Sunday night, ""Coco"" will win an Oscar. Buy it, bring it home, it will win the hearts of your entire family. ""Coco"" is just what your family needs in these troubled times."
"193",4.5,"  What a great movie not perfect but surely worth seeing."
"194",5,"  90/100""Coco"" es en resumidas palabras una maravilla; inspirada en la festividad mexicana del DÌa de los Muertos, sigue la historia de Miguel, un ni√±o que ama la m√∫sica aunque su familia no lo apoye, y que se ve envuelto en una aventura fant√°stica en la Tierra de los Muertos que le permitir√° conocerse mejor, entender el significado de la familia y de la muerte en s√≠; y lo hace apostando por un primera ligereza que va progresando gradualmente, con algunos momentos de gran impacto emocional como otros en donde predominada la diversi√≥n, gracias a la detallada investigaci√≥n que hicieron y que se traduce en un dise√±o de personajes y ambientaci√≥n que fluye y encanta con gran naturalidad para la historia que pretende contarnos, visualmente es otra gozada de Pixar y su m√∫sica es todo un deleite, aunque s√≠, hay que admitir que no es perfecta, y es que se le notan y se los ve venir los ""trucos"" de Pixar por llegarnos al coraz√≥n pero da igual si los notas o te los ves venir, estos vienen tan potenciados que es imposible no caer rendido y sumamente complacido al verla (sobre todo en su tercer acto)."
"195",5,"  I'll be quick..I ? Coco"
"196",5,"  best animation movie ever"
"197",5,"  Watched this movie with my family a couple of days ago. I wasn't expecting anything great, but OH MY GOSH! This movie is the best! The music, characters, animation, and story were amazing! I was on the floor laughing at some points, and other I was bailing my eyes out! Disney's Pixar did it again, I love this movie and plan on watching it again so! Top 5 Disney Pixar movies!"
"198",4,"  Lively, Timely, and Unforgettable. Besides very few sluggish moments, this is a sweet little sundae of a film."
"199",5,"  i didnt expect it to make me cry. Emotional film."
"200",4.5,"  Great movie , touching like up. Book of life gives it a good run for its money but the Mexican afterlife setting is a perfect partnership for a Pixar production and is a jaw dropping visual treat"
"201",4,"  As someone who isnt too familiar with the culture this film represents. This movie still succeeds with flying colors with a heartfelt script, dazling visuals and a good voice cast. Not pixars best but a must see nontheless."
"202",3.5,"  Coco - Pixar animation plays an enchanting & colourful Mexican folklore of culture, family, life & death. Director Lee Unkrich's imaginative narrative is worth the mention. Coco - muy bien ??"
"203",5,"  Great movie The ending will deeply effect anyone with heart who have lost people they cared about."
"204",5,"  Fantastic as always. Pixar knows exactly what they are doing by this point, especially with original films, and we are all here to experience their ""gems""."
"205",5,"  Another movie that should have been made sooooo long ago...what took you so long Hollywood...this is a spectacularly beautiful movie that touches the heart and mind in so many ways, teaches us about the importance of following your passion, loving your family and being true to one self. This movie is one of the best Pixar movies in terms of overall visuals, songs, emotional plateaus and finding something redeeming in humanity...While no movie may ever exceed Toy story in the Pixar library this movie reminds you why Pixar studios is animation and story telling at its absolute finest."
"206",5,"  Very nice, sweet movie."
"207",5,"  A love letter to Mexican culture and a celebration of family with some of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen. Thank you, Pixar!"
"208",5,"  Wonderful, colorful and beautiful film!"
"209",5,"  Coco celebrates life by diving into death. It is one of Pixar's most vibrant, melancholic adventure is a refreshing return to form.Coco is the story of a 12-year-old Mexican-American boy, Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), who finds himself in the land of the dead, after breaking a decades-old family rule about playing music. The film riffs heavily on the Mexican festival D√≠a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), with its traditionally vibrant imagery of brightly coloured skeletons. In this flamboyant netherworld, our young hero sets out on a journey to expose a secret from his family's past. This, it is heavily hinted, will centre on the famous musician Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who just happens to be Miguel's idol.Although it has a predictable plot elements in a Pixar playbook, the script does manage one genuinely surprising twist in the third act. As the final stretch approaches, there's also the requisite tug at the heartstrings although it's delivered with such devastating delicacy that even steely viewers will find themselves moist-eyed. Coco is a rousing, affecting, fun and much-needed return to form after underwhelming Finding Nemo and Cars sequels and will help to ensure that Pixar's legacy remains intact."
"210",5,"  If its Pixar, you know its good."
"211",5,"  I didn't expect that this movie would be worth watching. I didn't expect it to make me cry."
"212",5,"  One of the best adaptation I've ever seen of Disney regarding a local culture and traditions. Full of feelings and memorable songs."
"213",5,"  Another masterpiece from Pixar."
"214",4.5,"  This film is visually stunning. It has a great story with a lot of heart and great characters. The music isn't half bad either. Another great success from Pixar."
"215",3,"  MY kids loved it. I thought it was entertaining for an animated movie."
"216",5,"  One of the best animations I've seen for a very long time. Colourful, funny, thought provoking and emotional. Loved it!"
"217",4,"  Contains all the classic Pixar elements, but the Mexican setting, the music, and a really well thought out story put this in the absolute top bracket."
"218",5,"  This is an amazingly well done movie. Coco has such a rich amount of culture and great music in it. I love the message of remembering those who preceded us, our ancestors. We should honor their memory. We should also be our own individual as we do so. Coco has very beautiful animation. There is a significant amount of humor and it is just a fun movie to watch. It really makes me appreciate my family a lot more"
"219",5,"  I cried so hard at the end."
"220",4.5,"  Arguably one of the best pixar films to come out in a very long time! The visuals are stunning, the music is beautiful and memorable and the characters are great. A great movie for kid and adults alike would definitly reccomend watching"
"221",5,"  Tarde a la fiesta, pero quÈ hermosa es Coco. Sorprendido por las pocas risas, pero se compensa con creces con las l√°grimas. Visualmente bell√≠sima, bell√≠sima entera. Michael Giacchino y su banda sonora espectacular, como siempre."
"222",5,"  Greeeeat Movie! A must see! It is funny, touching, inspirational. Probably one of my favorite Pixar movies."
"223",4,"  First and foremost, the 'Frozen' short is horrendous. I heard an 8 year old with a confused-whine ask the question 'Is this the movie?'. This was so bad, I wonder if my opinion on Coco was lowered due to the suffering.Coco - its a good story, but something amiss in the beginning. The story blooms & comes together later - but again I feel like it just missed the mark. Yes, tears are shed and there are some amazing well done scenes. I can't even review it further, cause I'm still peeved at the Frozen short."
"224",5,"  One of the best pictures of the year"
"225",5,"  A beautiful film in more ways then one. Absolutely a wonder to behold."
"226",5,"  The movie is a real feast for the senses. Worth seeing a few times. Really beautiful work. Maybe the most lush animated film I have ever seen."
"227",5,"  Marvellous film! Great addition to the Pixar Disney empire!"
"228",5,"  Fantastic in every way"
"229",5,"  me likey good mexico movie"
"230",5,"  Brilliant, smart and with heart. Pixar's Coco is another masterpiece from the studio, visually insane, amazing characters, surprising plot twist, extremely cultural and provide strong families lessons. (5/5)"
"231",3.5,"  Cute for the kids, funny but forgettable. Coco is a clever made animated feature film. That's what it is. There's a beginning, a middle and an end. The soundtrack is average, not memorable. At some point it feels like the writer was searching too much for where it should be heading to. Topics like life and death run throughout the movie, so I would consider this a 12+ movie and not for all ages. Nice to watch on a Sunday afternoon when you got nothing else to do.@Korben_Dallas on Twitter"
"232",5,"  Loved this film! It teaches children about death, in a way that they will understand. The animation is beautiful, and the characters are so funny.It will make you laugh and cry. Should see it with family!"
"233",5,"  Top tier disney movie. Refreshing"
"234",4,"  One of Pixar's better efforts, and while very heavily hyped (as usual), it's not completely overhyped for a change. Perfect it isn't, but it's quite clever and, to my surprise, actually uses the fairly morbid setting to tell a surprisingly dark story in the latter half."
"235",5,"  This movie is so beautiful. I can't express how much I loved it."
"236",5,"  Exciting, visually stunning, dramatically very well made movie."
"237",5,"  Amazing movie...makes me appreciate my family more??"
"238",5,"  First movie that really made me cry, no other movie has achieved that."
"239",0.5,"  Simply the WORST Disney Movie ever made. Worse than any educational nature film of the 50's. Worse than the 2-bit animation of the 60's. And if any artist who worked on Moana had to also work on this, they should be paid PTSD damages. Absolutely NOTHING is good about this movie. It made me sick. I could'nt finish it and demand my money back from Amazon.About as fun to watch as road debris decaying."
"240",4.5,"  Heart warming, inspiring and one of a kind. Great family friendly movie, giving a brief glimpse of Mexican culture and providing a different perspective on life after death."
"241",4,"  Book of life was better 8/10"
"242",5,"  So beautiful in so many ways. I loved it!"
"243",5,"  An emotional ride better suited for adults."
"244",4,"  A sweet and funny animation that can be watched both by young people, old people and children. It's a feel good movie all the way, but you are never bored during it. And also it's very beautifully done and nice to see Disney pick up on some spanish (Latino) culture too."
"245",5,"  A great film. Stunning visuals accompanied by a thoughtful story. A solid equal to Pixar's greatest, like Wall-E, Toy Story, and Inside Out."
"246",5,"  Good Family oriented non sjw movie. What a relief!"
"247",5,"  If you don't cry, get a soul"
"248",5,"  Lee Unkrich is a great story teller."
"249",5,"  Watching Coco assures me that all the work that I've put into shooting and printing the full family portraits today is totally worth it!Pixar has once again amazed us with yet another brilliantly crafted animation.Thank you all. :)"
"250",4.5,"  Disney/Pixar did it again. A wonderful warm story about family and morals. In every pixar movie you have a funny figure and this time it is the dog. I love him, very funny!!"
"251",5,"  Awesome movie.. nice tracks and overall a must see"
"252",3.5,"  There are few animated films that are as visually stunning and impressive, and as emotionally satisfying and affecting as Coco, which is a story that touches on Mexican folklore and its syncretic beliefs - which is very similar to Asian beliefs of ancestral worship such as in Taoism. The most moving part would be when the song ""Remember Me"" is sung - I think there's nary a dry eye in the theatre as we are reminded that what finally matters and remains important is that it's about relationships: about family, friendships.... and forgiveness."
"253",3.5,"  Slow moving and predictable at times but the COLORS! Wow!"
"254",4,"  Coco, qui n'est pas sans rappeler un certain jeu vidÈo du nom de Grim Fandango, c√©l√®bre de belle fa√ßon la culture mexicaine et diff√©rents th√®mes tel que la famille et la mort (sans √™tre pour autant √™tre morbide) et plaira √† coup s√ªr √† toute la famille avec plusieurs moments tr√®s rigolo."
"255",3,"  Fun movie about family."
"256",5,"  Me gusto esta pel√≠cula porque la tengo descargada legalmente y tambi√©n me encanto sus canciones. Saludos desde M√©xico"
"257",5,"  Beautiful film and very thought provoking"
"258",4,"  This movie has a lot of heart and some insanely emotional scenes. The only thing I don't like about it is it is kind of predictable. I already knew what was happening from 1/3 of the way through and it sort of played out exactly that way. I also think it wasn't as original as some make it out to be. I feel like this theme has been played before and it would be interesting to see a different aspect of Mexican culture. The music is catchy and most people will like it. Overall it is a really heartfelt movie and most people will find something they like about it."
"259",5,"  The art direction could have been better to support the incredible pixar polish. However the music, heart, and characters well make up for the lack luster execution of a fantastical setting. You will cry. A lot. And then a week later that song gets stuck in your head and you cry again."
"260",4,"  Coco is a very good, but unfortunately disappointing film which is far from Pixar's best works. The standout aspects are its world building which is amazing, its animation which is beautiful and pleasingly colorful and its mythology which has some very interesting concepts very well explored. The film explores death so well, it is sophisticated in that theme and it is particularly effective in the portrayal of Mexican culture and D√≠a de los Muertos. The characterization is good and I particularly loved the second act with the fantasy adventure angle to it. But even though its emotional ending was somewhat earned, it was still too sentimental. The twist is also quite easy to predict. And its major problem is the soundtrack. Remember Me is definitely a good, well utilized song, but the rest of the songs are very weak and never at all comparable to the works of Disney. And when you have a film that is literally about music, you need to have a killer soundtrack which sadly isn't the case with Coco."
"261",4,"  Amazing family film, with great humor and outstanding animation"
"262",5,"  Pixar is Great. And I only cried a little."
"263",5,"  This is one of the best and most beautiful animated movies I've seen ever. The music, characters, scale, and colors are a delight to all of yours senses!"
"264",5,"  Watch it without spoilers. I'm not asking."
"265",5,"  E ainda tem quem diga que a Disney/Pixar n√£o fazem anima√ß√µes como antigamente!!"
"266",5,"  Beautiful animation and a fun time for family members and Disney fans, Pixar still has the magic of making great animated stories. A"
"267",4.5,"  The heartwarming ""Coco"" is everything you expect from Pixar. It packs beautiful animation, pathos, and humor, while always being respectful to the culture it illustrates."
"268",5,"  Storytelling at its finest, attention to detail at its greatest and animation at its most ambitious! Is there anybody who could beat Pixar?!"
"269",4,"  Much of the joy in Coco is derived from the beautifully rendered Land of the Dead, animated in bright colors and intricate designs which honor the spirit of Mexican culture, with inhabitants appearing as skeletal versions of their former selves. It's refreshing to see a studio with such a massive reach take such care in representing other cultures."
"270",3,"  Visually pleasing but doesn't live up to the pixar originality that you're used to. The story feels a little generic even if it was an enjoyable adventure."
"271",5,"  Pixar as a studio is known for its thought-provoking, emotional, entertaining and original stories. ""Coco"" might be their most beautiful and charming film yet."
"272",4.5,"  nice story with so much heart and emotion,plus great music"
"273",0.5,"  Horrible illegal alien propaganda. The pixar version of the movie Turbo."
"274",5,"  Preciosa de principio a fin!"
"275",5,"  An instant life-time favorite."
"276",5,"  make sure you bring some tissues as you will cry"
"277",4,"  Watching cartoon skeletons for an hour is not very visual appealing. However, the story was well developed and very touching."
"278",5,"  The best family movie ever ... good and great plot and funny movie and overall i like it ... hope have sequel for this movie ..."
"279",4.5,"  Um filme bel√≠ssimo e emocionante da Pixar. H√° cenas que garantem l√°grimas do telespectador, as can√ß√µes s√£o encantadoras e o filme vai tocar seu cora√ß√£o. Mais um acerto da Disney-Pixar."
"280",4.5,"  wow,that was refreshing."
"281",5,"  This is a perfect movie. Might be Pixar's best film to date"
"282",5,"  This movie was so beautiful! It made me cry quite a few times. It definitely tugs at your heartstrings."
"283",5,"  Best movie ever. What a great family movie will make you cry and laugh"
"284",4,"  Another triumph from Pixar."
"285",5,"  TV Picture Mode settings for the Best Movie Ever Made.I just watched the iTunes Digital HD version of Coco thru my AppleTV (4th gen) on a 48"" 1080p Visio TV. I played with the picture settings and got pretty good results, so I want to share them. WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT-- The craftsmanship of the animation in Coco is astonishing. I fell in love with the A++ story, the symbolism, the dialog, the music, the cultural enlightenment (for me, anyway), and topping it off the animation. I am addicted. I saw Coco in the theater 20 times (3 in 3D) and each time I appreciated the workmanship in new ways: the entire topography of both worlds and how they moved in the background; reflections off wood, metal, and glass surfaces; scratches on guitar fingerboards; Miguel's hair; hundreds of different clothing outfits, with remarkably realistic textures; and on and on. I cannot name any movie of any kind that shows more effort in the making, and at the same time is so enjoyable. SO-I was worried that the home video versions would not do justice. But I was able to see most of what I saw at the theater - and I even continued to see even a lot more at home. This might be because my settings are a little bit lighter than the theater, so many background objects and other details were more visible. I am no expert, and I am hoping a few will offer better settings. But if you are not happy with your picture, I offer the following for your consideration. On Visio I had best luck with Picture Mode ""Calibrated"" which was: Backlight 100; Brightness 50; Contrast 80; Color 50; Tint 0; and Sharpness 50. I preferred Auto Brightness = Off."
"286",5,"  Return to form for Pixar. After a series of toy selling movies (though I like cars) this movie comes back with a bit of Pixar finesse. When it came out I was thinking how different it will be from Book of life but I was presently surprised. The characters were developed with high degree of artistry and the animation is top of the line (looks too real some times). The bond of family is exemplified by this movie and audience will feel the emotional surges as one progresses through the movie. The songs are nice and ""people"" of land of the dead are endearing. One of those movies which I will rewatch."
"287",2,"  It's a Disney / Pixar: obviously is a good movie. But I didn't like it and these are my reasons. 1. ""The book of life"" is still fresh in my mind, so the story feel borrowed (even if it's not). 2. It's not as funny as D/P movies usually are. 3. The music, as well, it's not as good as usual. 4. The most important reason is that I saw the story coming from miles away. I know, it's a movie for kids and families, not an Agatha Christie. So I invite all those kids and families to come here and give a 4 or 5 star reviews. But from my point of view, if I see the plot twist coming from scene 1... then the film is ruined. And doesn't matter if I am watching a psychological thriller or a cartoon. I repeat, is a good movie, but It's not really my fault if D/P set the standard so high with masterpieces like ""Wally"" or ""Zootopia"" or ""UP"" or many more. Now they have to live with it, and so do I."
"288",4,"  This film has a lot going for it once you start watching it, and then you might realize that it's great! I definitely though that Disney playing the twenty(!) minute Olaf from Frozen short in front of this film did it great disservice. However, I will agree with many others that this is Pixar in a return to form with a grounded, well-developed story, and sympathetic characters. Oh, and it's rather pretty to look at."
"289",5,"  Coco is the second best animation movie I've ever seen, losing to Inside Out. Every part of it is creative, refreshing, inovating and clever, the characters voice work couldn't be better as the touching, significant and beautiful songs. It will make you in tears if you are a sensible one. The design was dazzling as the story which portrays perfectly the mexican costums and life."
"290",5,"  The Pixar Masterpice"
"291",4.5,"  In the first few minutes of the movie I became worried, because this plot of ""all music being banned for some overdramatic reason, but the hero wanting to pursue a career/hobby in music anyway"" has been done before, namely in The Little Mermaid 3, and I hated the conflict in that. And I hated it here too.I understand this family's disgust for their great grandfather's decision to leave his family behind to become a musician, but to ban music? What cartoony nonsense is that. Why is everyone obsessed with shoes, when all they need to do is be obsessed with keeping every family member from leaving and starting a future of their own. The struggles the main character has to go through would still be present, but more importantly, the family would have an extreme, but more believable response to their great grandmother's tragedy. But it's not only them I don't understand. I also don't understand is the main character's blind dream to be like said grandfather. Let's ignore the brilliant plot twist at the end, the boy thought this man had abandoned his wife and daughter, yet he's never expressed his disapproval for that. Others in the movie have, but not this child we're supposed to be rooting for. Didn't he think, even once, that it was a little bit sick of this man to leave his wife to take care of their young daughter, for his own selfish goals? How old was this daughter then? 4? Is it impossible for someone to pursue their dreams a few years later, perhaps? And when the main character learns about his grandfather being this rich, famous Mexican superstar, his idol, did he not once ponder why he never sent his struggling wife money?Anyway, despite this movie's cheap set-up and these unanswered questions, it was an entertaining story. Disney is getting an increasing taste for writing plot twists, which I'm fine with, I always like a surprise.I just hope their next movie doesn't have the recycled plot of a worse, less successful movie."
"292",5,"  It was amazing movie probably the best movie I have seen in a long time!! It had perfect plot twists,great characters, great visuals and attention to detail for the image quality and an amazing lesson to teach."
"293",4,"  pixar.. I trust in you again."
"294",5,"  Coco's cultural message is highly kairotic; on the heels of a year of particularly harsh press against our southern neighbors, Coco offers a warm and inclusive picture of the richness of Mexican culture in its art, music and family life."
"295",3,"  Fun, solid music, solid plot. Overall a solid movie. Seen better, but i've seen worse"
"296",4.5,"  A formulaic and honestly even predictable film with the exact tropes you have now come to expect from Pixar. The main character doesn't stand out and the villian is quite dissapoi... N-no. I'm not crying. Y-you're c-crying *wipes off nose*"
"297",4.5,"  Touching film had elements of UP with nasty baddie and a number of surprises, a good family film"
"298",5,"  A great movie that is right up there with Toy Story. The Spanish flavor of the movie is one of the main appeals along with the great story it conveys. Many people in the movie were crying at the end including my 15 year old."
"299",5,"  hermosa, hermosa pel√≠cula, me gusto todo, inclusive la m√∫sica conmueve"
"300",3.5,"  Coco is another fine animated film from Pixar, which should be enjoyed by the whole family."
"301",4,"  The movie would be an fantastic masterpiece, but the plot feels really used and two-dimensional half of the time"
"302",5,"  A beautiful movie, in every sense, with a deep sentiment."
"303",5,"  Coco is a very moving film that knows just how to pull at your heartstrings just enough to have you entertained the whole movie. You get just enough character from all the main characters to know how they are, it was very well made. It's a movie that's generally for anyone who just loves a good film about family and following your dream!"
"304",5,"  surely one of the best (y)"
"305",5,"  fairly predictable but undoubtedly has that pixar magic."
"306",3.5,"  This is one of the best films of the year while at the same time being completely forgettable. The music is all cut-off as soon as it starts... so you never hear a song actually completed during the film... so it is not really a musical that it tries to be. The song selections/writing was all poorly done but you will never hear a completed song anyway. The art direction is really well done with the eccentric color and lighting choices that make everything pop-out and look pretty. The story is rushed and constantly on the move but the rushed pacing feels ok unless they are cutting off another song."
"307",4.5,"  It looks grotesque at first, but there is a lot more to Coco than meets the eye. The music wasn't my favorite and nor was the animation, but what it lacks in other areas it makes up for in pure heart. It is such a sweet film with wonderful storytelling. (First and only viewing - 1/25/2018 in theaters)"
"308",4,"  mais j'aime mieux Book of life"
"309",3.5,"  It's nice to see another breathe of fresh air in the world of animated movies rather than the continued sequels that have plagued it for years among some original gems. I thought this was an ingenious concept and is brought to life in stunning visuals with a solid and heart tugging, if not a little predictable, plot.However, this is far from my favourite Pixar. While the idea of the land of the dead is good, I feel that this Pixar entry doesn't quite match up in terms of script. In other entries we are used to having a story that will have clever references that while the adults might get, the kids might miss. A lovely story but not special enough for me and probably a one off watch."
"310",4.5,"  This is one of the best animation movie I have ever watch. Stunning visual, simple story but have deep message about family. Yeah Coco deserve perfect score"
"311",5,"  A beautiful, rhythmic, and emotional movie which has been designed to perfection that will make anyone of any age group smile and cry at the same time.This is a movie I will remember for a long time. I just demand an explanation as to how a cat and a dog can see both the living and the dead in the movie."
"312",5,"  A very complex and intertwined storyline from the makers of Pixar and Disney. A great memorable movie I will never forget for so long, from now. Would highly recommend it to others and friends."
"313",5,"  Pixar knock it out of the park once again with this brilliant and poignant film. The animation is simply stunning."
"314",5,"  Excelent movie, I keep thinking of it everyday since the last two months"
"315",5,"  Definitely one of my favorites from pixar. The storyline and message in this movie was extremely moving. The visual effects just kicks it up to be an all time great."
"316",5,"  Another great piece of movie made by Pixar. Highly recommended!!!"
"317",4,"  Very good movie and very emotional. You're pretty much guaranteed to cry in this shit."
"318",5,"  What a wonderful movie! I wish it would get half the viewership of the much lesser kid movies out there. Great message, beautifully done."
"319",4,"  Very fun and entertaining Pixar film."
"320",4.5,"  I don't often cry when watching a movie. Cried like a baby at the end of this one. Beautiful movie, and in my opinion the best Pixar film to this day.Great representation of Dias de los Muertos, and shown in should a beautiful and colorful way (Maybe Trump will get more appreciation for Mexican culture!), and most of all, the music is unforgettable! I rarely give a film more than 4 stars, but now it's very well deserved!"
"321",4.5,"  I don't often cry when watching a movie. Cried like a baby at the end of this one.

I rarely give a film more than 4 stars, but now it's very well deserved!"
"322",4.5,"  Best animation movie I've seen in a long time. I was quite sceptical but I was amazed by the flick. Great work, amazing soundtrack, lovely characters. A bit too sad though."
"323",5,"  You must go watch Coco.It's a beautiful exploration of music, life and family. I loved the Mexican culture dive, especially the music which is unique and touching. I was crying a lot in the 2nd half- along with most of the cinema, and thinking about it for the rest of the day."
"324",4,"  Coco n„o chega a figurar entre as melhores anima√ß√µes do est√∫dio, nem √© a melhor anima√ß√£o de 2017, mas √© visualmente lindo e muito emocionante."
"325",5,"  Great film with fun animation and storytelling. The cultural nuances are also spot on. Would recommend seeing it in Spanish if you speak it."
"326",5,"  Incredibly touching movie, especially for anyone who has lost and desperately misses a loved one. The scene with ""Coco"" at the end had me in tears but also smiles. Thank you so much Pixar, for a wonderful experience."
"327",4,"  Lovely, lovely, lovely. I didn't cry, but I'm a heartless husk. Any normal person would. The final act is a masterpiece - bravo."
"328",5,"  Coco is a great Pixar movie about remembering or forgettingor even about family"
"329",5,"  Another home run for pixar. Another perfect film delivered that focuses on family and the strength of it even through hard times and death. A true marvel."
"330",4.5,"  Beautiful story and graphics"
"331",5,"  Omg me and my girls loved this movie. The art was wonderful, music was beautiful and one awesome twist!!"
"332",5,"  One of the greatest animation i've seen in years. This movie had me crying like if I lost a family member. This movie deserves an Oscar"
"333",3.5,"  ugh; the previews for this film didn't interest me one bit so i've never really had the urge to watch it. but watch it, i did, today -- and of course i loved it. the heartstrings were pulled & tears were shed. i don't love it as much as i've loved other Pixar films, so i probably won't watch it again, but it was well worth the only watch."
"334",4,"  Strengths: As always with Pixar films, this was visually stunning. Bright colors and exquisite animation are all over Coco. Where the movie truly excels is in its heart. Very few movies targeted towards kids can get you as emotional as this one did. I teared up twice in the closing moments and am not ashamed to admit that. The voice acting is strong across the board, especially by the newcomer lead, Anthony Gonzalez (Miguel). The heartbreaking work of Gael Garcia Bernal (Hector) is the highlight here. The movie does a masterful job in showcasing the Mexican culture and paying respect to their traditions, without being over the top. It's a tough line to toe. One thing Pixar always masters is how they craft an entire world in places we don't expect. Toys, cars, feelings, animals, and now, the dead. The world of the dead is explained and shown in enough detail that we come to understand it very well.Weaknesses: There's a clearly underdeveloped main villain. It's technically Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), but we're only privy to that information after a large chunk of story. He doesn't get a ton of time to stand out. For a film about music, there's a disappointing lack of it. We only really get two songs and one is honestly kind of bland. A case could be made that some parts won't really work for the young audience it aims for.Overall: Another wonderfully charming outing from Pixar Studios. The thoughtful narrative, combined with the magnificent visuals, make for one of their best works in years. You'll laugh, cry, and find yourself in awe at times."
"335",5,"  Exquisite animation celebrates family and culture. Invigorates an unpredictable story that made kids in the cinema dance and punch the air. Sophisticated dialogue provokes reflection and stirs emotions of all present in ways few films manage."
"336",5,"  Pixar have done it again. Beautiful - ugly crying in the cinema. I will remember my family better after this."
"337",5,"  Such a lovely film , recommend to all."
"338",5,"  An amazing animation and a master piece. Another emotional and outstanding treat from pixar."
"339",5,"  A visually stunning movie containing within it an inspirational and heartwarming story. With characters fully drawn both in animation and real human foibles, the unique story follows a young Mexican boy pursuing his dream to play music in a family that has banned all music. Delving deeply into Mexican cultural history, that is revelatory but not dogmatic, it traces a story that is not predictable and always fascinating. Without any stereotypes of character or traditional Disney story line, it illuminates ideas of death, growing up family and pursuing one's dreams at all costs. Coco does all this masterfully and stunningly in less than two hours. Don't miss it,"
"340",4,"  Pixar is constantly surprising me. I had no idea how this idea would work, but it was beautifully executed. Got tears at the end. Okay, the main song was played a few too many times, but overall very sweet. Good twists and turns to the story that my kids and I all enjoyed."
"341",5,"  Beautiful, heartfelt, funny, entertaining"
"342",3,"  Very colorful. The settings steal the show, though the candy-skull skeletons are clever. The songs are okay, the obligatory art-gag features Frida Kahlo, and the heart-tugging is about memory this time.."
"343",4,"  Such an amazing heart warming little gem"
"344",5,"  Wonderful movie for the whole family! Good story with some unexpected twists and turns. Great soundtrack as well."
"345",5,"  From toys to monsters to robots to the voices inside our heads, Pixar has done it all. But with Coco, Pixar gives us a taste of the Mexican culture and the Land of the Dead. Beautifully animated with a story that teaches everyone to follow their dreams, fun characters, both living and dead, and compelling music to tell another amazing story from the Pixar geniuses."
"346",5,"  i didnt know that a movie so bright and colorful would make me tear up on the ending. It really stabs you with the word ""family"" written on the blade of a knife"
"347",5,"  The only movie I decided to create an account and write a review...."
"348",4.5,"  Huge surprise for me. The twist that they pull off in this movie is truly beautiful and hard to see coming. Not only is the animation beautiful but it tells a very compelling story as well."
"349",5,"  cried the whole way though. absolutely loved it"
"350",0.5,"  To quote Mr Bush - that was some weird shit"
"351",3.5,"  While the movie's visuals are stunning, and rich underlying culture interesting, Coco's storyline is not at par with Pixar standard. Compared with Inside Out for example, the lead character lacks the complexity and inner struggles on the road to find one's true identify."
"352",5,"  Another work of art from Pixar"
"353",1.5,"  Yet more emotional gibberish from Pixar! How am I not surprised? Some of us are smart enough to no longer be fooled by this! But in a year of horrible animated films it doesn't really surprise me to once again see everyone acting like this now the single best animated ever! It'll be quickly forgotten as it should by this summer, guaranteed!"
"354",4,"  Deftly emotional and sincere with its story, Coco carves its own edge into Pixar's brilliant track record and stirs up a tale of music, family and purpose all intertwined with the backdrop of the Mexican celebratory day of the dead. Like Monstropolis or Andy's Bedroom before it, the Land of the Dead is both intoxicatingly deep and also viciously energetic. At some points of the film I did feel like it went a little off track and the film also unfortunately suffers from an extremely under-developed main villain and this was an aspect of the film that felt pretty rushed, but apart from that everything else was pretty much perfect. The few songs that are in the film are all extremely memorable and soulful and the voice acting is brilliant, particularly Anthony Gonzales as the protagonist and Gael Garcia Bernal as Hector. There weren't as many ""wink wink nudge nudge"" moments as are usually present in Pixar films, so this may be one for the adults to avoid slightly as there wasn't much comedy present there for more mature audiences, however the emotional punch of an ending was definitely something that all would be able to appreciate."
"355",5,"  Truly remarkable and beautiful movie a must watch for everyone."
"356",5,"  Beautiful movie. The mexican tradition really stands out and I love it! Fun for all the family"
"357",5,"  THE BEST MOVIE. So many emotions, happy, suspense, excitement, fear, sadness, and all around amazing. I very very very strongly suggest you watch it or buy it, I am that confident you'll love it."
"358",5,"  COCO *****The latest animation by Disney is a modern day triumph showing that in ever changing climates that they still have the power to provide the heartwarming classic tales to new generations.?Coco†follows the story of a young Mexican boy banished from following his dream of music by his family and on the celebrated Day of The Dead he triggers a curse that sends him to the world of the Dead. Yes, yes I know not quite Bambi in fact the pitch raises the question as to whether Disney was taken over by a morbidly obsessed fan of the latest Mexican hating President but evidently that is not case.¬†Coco¬†is a beautifully crafted story that has to be one of the more original animations from Disney for some time. ¬†¬†The premise fresh playing on the traditions of the Mexican nation. The film highlights their diverse culture and celebrations in a glowing light instead of the hate filled rants coming from a certain White House Resident. The film makers have almost purposely taken the film as a climate orientated opportunity to ,¬†¬†show the world that not everyone is painted with the same brush.?The story flows in the rather standard way in the first act but is truly notched up there onwards to propel expectations and style of the modern day animations much like Frozen allowed the twist to freshens it's style.?The animators are in no doubt of their audiences which accounts not only for children but the adults accompanying them with a story that in the third act ¬†has borrowed a narrative that is almost Shakespearean in it's tragedy and unites the audience with it's common humanity.¬†?Knowing full well that the prime audience is children the makers impose good morals and messages in a story that touches, amuses, entertains and surprises you with sweet tenderness.?The jokes are funny, the songs are catchy and the effects are the standard spot on animations that just seem to fail to age.?I was skeptical of how Disney would pull of a hard sell premise of a kid who spends the film hanging out with dead talking skeletons but hey it works and I can't wait to see what they do next. ¬†"
"359",4.5,"  one of my best pixar flims just behind toy story 3"
"360",5,"  Visually stunning and filled with beautiful music, Pixar cleans house again as they delve into an important aspect of a beautiful culture."
"361",5,"  A wonderful fantastic animation of brilliant colour, song and true heart and soul. I didn't know much about this film before seeing it and was drawn into story and character, richly interwoven with Mexican culture and family history. Exceptional acting from the young star, Anthony Gonzalez, whose singing voice was a delightful surprise. I'm sure this young star will have a brilliant career ahead. I loved the themes in this film that digs deeply into our need for family connection."
"362",4,"  A fun and emotional display of Mexican folklore. Bravo"
"363",5,"  Simply fantastic, it brought tears to my eyes."

"371",5,"  Probably the best pixar film yet. Seems really respectful to Latin culture. Had some great music and best of all was a visual masterpiece. Regardless of age, see this film."
"372",5,"  Very good. W Bella in RWC.Strong all the way around! Add as Movie Library title."
"373",5,"  Colorful. delivery great store of Mexican culture in inspiring and make me tear."
"374",4.5,"  Very touching.But it is a little creepy"
"375",5,"  Without a doubt my favorite Disney movie!"
"376",0.5,"  I really hated it because I haven't sawed it yet"
"377",5,"  I never had my doubts that Disney's next installment would have been a masterpiece! It really is a masterpiece! ""Coco"" managed to tell the most beautiful story, had such a great plot, and created such a wonderful world and managed to haunt me for life. There are little things that are important in life and ""Coco"" is all about those things. It is a family movie, more than other animated movies, and is full of soul. ""Coco"" is an instant classic!"
"378",5,"  Wonderful family movie with a narrative that is long overdue."
"379",5,"  A faultless offering from Pixar. Bright, funny, poignant, action packed and a stunning spectacle. A heart wrenching ending that makes me well up just thinking about it! Absolutely up there with Toy Story, Nemo and Up!"
"380",2.5,"  I didn't like this movie, I believe that the theme of 'look at life differently' has been done far better in other movies of the past and that the setting wasn't really right to tell the story to its potential.The characters as always with Pixar, are mostly relatable and likeable but I had a hard time liking the main character Miguel as I thought he was a bit selfish and was basically the 'musician who wants to be a star' trope but I liked the side characters 'Philipe and Oscar' because even with limited screen time they still made me chuckle with their introduction to the story. I'll give the movie credit for its wonderful soundtrack and it's solid animation but other than that there is nothing much I can give this movie. I don't know whats next in the pixar line up but I know it will probably be better than Coco."
"381",5,"  Great family flick along the lines of Tim Burton. Many thanks, lots for everyone."
"382",5,"  Coco is one of Pixar's finest. Much like Inside Out, it'll have the adults reaching for the tissues and the kids reaching for the popcorn. It is beautifully animated, spectacularly plotted, and is Pixar's closest film yet to a musical. Pixar seem to take more tears out of me with each instalment and I am totally okay with that."
"383",4.5,"  Whilst predictable at times it nether the less tells a heartwarming story with real emotional impact."
"384",5,"  I absolutely loved this movie! I can see why it has a high rating on here! There was so much to it that I personally learned, a lot that I related with. Perhaps people found it boring if they were not familiar with Mexican culture, but it is truly accurate of what the culture represents. I could watch it again, and definitely recommend it."
"385",5,"  Disney Pixar never disappoints."
"386",4.5,"  You can't miss one of the best Pixar flicks of the decade!"
"387",4.5,"  This movie makes me update the family tree. Rejoin with all the family members. It was an amazing journey."
"388",2,"  although well done and pleasant to watch the underlying message of all dead people gather in a place for eternity and keep coming back etc etc is very old fashioned and very religious without any further study on the subject accepting a priori something that is tottaly questionable and it doesnt make sense. the only message i kept is a symnbolic approach of the importance of family togetherness."
"389",4,"  Pixar explores Mexican culture, investigating the spirituality and mythos of Day of the Dead while digging into a family conflict that's several generations old. It's a visual, audible and emotional delight, enlivened with loud splashes of color and texture, and accompanied by a constantly upbeat musical vitality. There's no escaping the visual fabric of this film, immersive and jaw-dropping, as it constantly one-ups itself right alongside the developing plot. Particularly stunning is our crossing into the land of the dead, a monumental city of stacked shanties that shimmers and glistens and pulses as its residents decorate and celebrate their annual recognition. The story is simple but effective, perhaps a touch on the predictable side... but so are many animated classics, and sometimes there's something to be said for following through on a promise. Coco wears its heart on its sleeve, with a permeating, spirited warmth that's impossible to ignore, while also touching on tricky, lingering feelings of betrayal and repression. Dazzling and optimistic, with a subject that's, surprisingly, never been explored with such playful reverence in a major family film. Good to see the studio has kept tabs on that bottled magic; for a while, I worried they'd misplaced it."
"390",5,"  A well-written movie that came with a twist while sticking to Mexican roots!"
"391",4.5,"  My thoughts after watching this movie!1. I cried, I said to myself in the beginning you won't cry. You nearly never cry watching a movie. As soon as the last act started... Damn you Disney, you made me cry!2. Disney will rule the world. Disney just knows how to make business and good movies. 3. I need to watch it again. So yeah: I loved this movie. I loved the story of this movie. Since I aspire also a career in music, I really felt for Miguel and understood his motivations. And I also have a crazy cute dog by my side. The animation was crazy. It was soo colorfull and deep. It felt real. As if you could touch the screen and be in this world. The only thing for me that didn't made me give 5 Stars, was ironicly the music. It wasn't bad but also not that memorable as well. The only one being Remember Me."
"392",5,"  Coco is a very charming animation by Pixar, healthy and entertaining for both young & old. This film will make you laugh and definitely cry but most of all, you will leave with that quivering emotion after it that you have just witnessed something great. :)"
"393",0.5,"  i got so bored, I fell asleep halfway through"
"394",4.5,"  Another masterpiece from Pixar and Disney. We watched the film at Disneyland Resort, which added to the magic. Visually it was great, and the plot was very touching."
"395",5,"  I definitely enjoyed the movie. Definitely gave many emotions towards the audience. Family is definitely a big theme throughout this movie in general and it was an overall good experience and movie."
"396",5,"  Coco was an amazing movie, Pixar always knows how to make amazing movies seeing as I've never hated a single one of Pixar's movies (yes that also means Cars 2). When I first heard about the movie it sounded like an interesting idea for a movie, then when the trailers came out I was crazy excited, I kept hearing people compare this movie to 2014's the Book of Life, I have never watched that movie so I wouldn't of understood it exactly apart from both movies being set in Mexico. Then when hearing the news that everyone loved the movie, I was getting even more excited... Until I discovered the movie wasn't coming to the UK until January of 2018 which made me mad! Thankfully I kept away from spoilers until the day I could watch the movie which was on the day of the movie's release in the UK which was the 19th of January of 2018.Now that I've seen Coco, I can finally say, I. Love. COCO!!!!This movie has an amazing story, amazing characters, amazing cast members who do great jobs playing the characters, amazing music, amazing songs like Remember me, Un Poco Loco, and The World Es Mi Familia, I'm not one for musicals but this movie's songs are so good. The animation from Pixar is always top notch seeing as this is Pixar we're talking about, the people who made the first computer animated movie and has had a track record of having amazing animation in their movies. The movie even has really funny jokes that feel right for the scenes that they're in, even the ones they showed in the trailers are still funny.The big question I have is that, is Coco my new favourite Pixar movie? or does that still go to Inside Out, I might have to have a re-watch of both movies for me to make my decision, I don't know.I will admit, I did cry to this movie, I was an emotional mess when seeing this movie. I highly recommend you go and see Coco while you can and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.I give Pixar's Coco a 10 out of 10, amazing movie and I can't wait to see what Pixar has in store for the future."
"397",3.5,"  Very good Pixar Disney animated movie. One of the better ones in recent years. Good fun for the entire family."
"398",2,"  Coco is lovely, both the imagery and the storytelling. But my daughter, age 6 insisted on leaving half-way through. Not being Latina (and me not knowing I needed to prepare her) she was wholly unfamiliar with El Dia de los Muertos and very scared and confused for most of the film. Some day I hope I can convince her to watch the film again and we will have good conversation about the cultural elements, but for now, I simply wish I had been warned. Adults may love it, but young children will need context."
"399",4,"  coco is the movie #1 that made me llorar pixar thanks to la movieposting : 23/1/18 ] rating : 4 star rating ."
"400",5,"  Coco es la prueba de que Pixar no se esta quedando sin ideas, de que puedes hacer una pelÌcula basada en la cultura mexicana sin caer en estereotipos y presentar una historia llena de sentimientos y valores que un estadounidense no entender√° la primera vez que vea coco.En resumen: Coco es la pel√≠cula que tienes que ver para recordar tus tradiciones y ra√≠ces como mexicano."
"401",4,"  A bright and vibrant adventure with superb animation, catchy songs, and colourful companions. The story is good and has strong morals, but the film jumps about tonally and is a bit too formulaic at times. Enjoyable and entertaining enough, but I thought the locations could have been more imaginative and spectacular."
"402",5,"  This is easily the animated piece of 2017. On the surface, its visuals- both in its animation and its design- are flawless and awe inspiring, and its music is pleasing to even the most tone deaf of ears. But, the further you dig into the story, the more your heart is gripped by this beautiful tale of family and ancestry. Never before have the dead felt so alive. You follow Coco- voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, in a tremendous film debut- through this beautifully spiritual and traditional piece into a land beyond our plane of existence, and through every twist and turn, you form a bond with the youngest of a shoemaking family and his adorable companion Dante. This is not only the greatest animated piece, but possibly the greatest Pixar piece ever made."
"403",2,"  Beautiful animation, beautiful music, but much like Pixar's recent work, flat."
"404",5,"  Uno de los tratamientos m√°s inteligentes que he visto en cine animado mainstream sobre la muerte, las memorias, la tradici√≥n y la cultura. Efectiva como monta√±a rusa de emociones, astuta al punto de jugar con su propia predictibilidad y momentos sentimentales, hicieron de un no muy fan de la m√∫sica mexicana apreciar ese mundo visual espectacular. No tienes desperdicios.All time great. Masterpiece."
"405",1.5,"  Not diverse enough. No LGBTQ+ characters.I expected more support from Disney."
"406",5,"  Arguably the best pixar movie so far"
"407",4.5,"  Excellent coco takes a dark tone but makes it into an amazing family adventure another triumph for pixar"
"408",5,"  Simply phenomenal storytelling. A beautiful? celebration of culture and family."
"409",4.5,"  Con la apariciÛn de Pixar hace ya m√°s de 22 a√±os, Disney dej√≥ de adaptar cuentos cl√°sicos a la pantalla grande y se dedic√≥ a realizar producciones totalmente originales y con un estilo √∫nico que ya es marca registrada. Pero no es solo un estudio de animaci√≥n dedicado a hacer pel√≠culas para ni√±os. Pixar se propone que personas de todas las edades puedan disfrutar de un buen film y Coco no es la excepci√≥n. Coco es una pel√≠cula hermosa con una gran banda sonora que entra de cabeza en mi top 3 de mis favoritas de Pixar. Coco nos permite disfrutar junto a los m√°s chicos de una gran aventura protagonizada por un ni√±o mexicano de 12 llamado Miguel que tiene un gran amor secreto: la m√∫sica. Sin embargo, tras un hecho tr√°gico que sucedi√≥ en su familia varias generaciones atr√°s, tiene prohibido cualquier acercamiento con la m√∫sica y est√° destinado a seguir el mandato familiar de ser zapatero. Pero en el D√≠a de los Muertos, celebraci√≥n muy importante de M√©xico en el que se recuerda a aquellos familiares que ya no est√°n, todo va a cambiar para el joven. All√≠ Miguel cree descubrir el verdadero motivo por el cual su familia odia la m√∫sica y gracias a su deseo de cambiar su destino viaja al ""m√°s all√°"" para encontrarse con sus familiares y otros personajes que ayudar√°n a Miguel a cumplir con su sue√±o y lograr que regres√© a la vida, mientras que otros intentar√°n cortar definitivamente con su fantas√≠a. Y es justamente en el ""mas all√°"" donde la pel√≠cula se propuso a apelar fuertemente a las emociones. Adem√°s de disfrutar de las aventuras de Miguel nos hace reflexionar a los m√°s grande sobre el v√≠nculo de la familia con aquellos que tenemos a nuestro al rededor y nos hace imposible no recordar a aquellos familiares que se fueron y que nunca vamos a olvidar. El mensaje de la pel√≠cula es claro y contundente: el recuerdo es lo m√°s importante que una persona puede dejar a los dem√°s y es lo que los mantiene vivos en nuestra memoria y en nuestros corazones."
"410",5,"  Thought it was little more than average until about 80% through, then the twist knocked me for six and the remainder was an extremely moving blub fest. I cry very easily in movies about kids, family histories and people coming back from the dead, so I'm a fairly easy target, and yes I know it was 99% manipulation, but hat's off, it was VERY effective. If you're not moved by this then you've truly got a heart of stone."
"411",2,"  100 veces mejor el libro de la vida y con una historia muy cercana. No es triste, no es particularmente emotiva e incluso es lenta. Puro hype y una ""familia dividida que se junta"" y todos la encuentran la mejor del a√±o"
"412",5,"  I thought this movie was really good. It was a little kids and adult movie to see. I really like the characters. They were really good character in this movies. I love all of the scene in this movie. I hope everyone loves this movie as much as I did too."
"413",4,"  Very common theme and I don't see where it fits at the Pixar Theory. Great movie and animation. Made me cry"
"414",5,"  The nitpicky asshats will point out why the movie's called Coco since they did the Legend of Zelda thing where the titular character isn't the protagonist and is instead a kid named Miguel. But that's not the point. I admit the movie gave off a bad first impression not simply because of Pixar's decline in quality in recent years but also because the teaser trailer gave off the impression that it was going to be a Book of Life knockoff. Although in that movie, he doesn't even die until the third act which trailers made the main selling point. However, that has always been Pixar's thing. The trailers make the movie look like your generic animated comedy but are more than that. And Coco is no exception. Once again, Pixar demonstrates how they're still the best in the business when it comes to modern animated movies. They're not terrified of moral guardians, something which even DreamWorks succumbed to after How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite what my opinions have to say about that. The animation is beautifully crafted. The animators once again worked their asses off and it shows. There's always a fine level of detail added. It deals with the themes of death from a child's perspective amazingly well and balances out slapstick antics with skeletons and a fine level of poignancy especially near the end of the movie. The music. Oh, God, the music. It's practically tearjerking. Bring some onions as an excuse for crying. Since most of Pixar's cast and crew was Latino, it showed that this was indeed Pixar's love letter towards Mexican culture, specifically Dia de los Muertos. Nothing feels like it's racist. There's is a predictable plot twist since we're constantly whacked on the head about a certain fact regarding Miguel's family but what movie hasn't done that? I think that was the writer's point. That you shouldn't make blind beliefs based solely off of pictures. Looks can be deceiving. Family comes first, all dreams have their own limitations, we should always consider the consequences of pursuing fame. And also, don't steal on the Day of the Dead if you're Mexican. Much like Inside Out and, to a lesser extent, Finding Dory, Coco shows that Pixar still hasn't lost their touch. Let's hope Incredibles 2 is just as awesome as the first movie. It has the same director though given Tomorrowland's reputation, we might have to be wary when going to see it. Only time will tell."
"415",5,"  It was such a good I made me laph and cry it was a great start to 2018"
"416",5,"  Fantastic movie for the whole family!"
"417",5,"  Wonderful movie! It is so nice to watch it with friends."
"418",5,"  Beautiful. Bring tissues."
"419",5,"  Very good movie for kids, took my little brother to see it and he loved it. Pixar really teachs your little ones the importance of family in this movie through the day of the dead holiday. Very well done and put together"
"420",4,"  A boy obsessed with music and the musical hero Ernesto De la Cruz goes in search of his dream; to play music but his family try to stop him, as Great Great Grampa left his family behind to be a musician. On the day of the dead they put photos out of their loved ones, so they can revisit the family. Grandma smashes Miguels guitar so he goes to find a guitar to play in the local talent show. One strum and he gets transported to the land of the dead..He has until sunrise to get back to the land of the living, whilst trying to find his Great great grandad . Visual brilliance by the pixar team once again, it is Very moving, very sad and makes you feel how important family really is."
"421",5,"  This movie was amazing and emotional. I cried at the part when Hector was dying and the part where Coco sings ""Remember me"" to his great-grandmother. It was very emotional but very sweet. And the twist where Hector was really his great great grandfather! This is now my favourite movie."
"422",5,"  good film makes me cry ????"
"423",1,"  Boring. Worst animated movie I've seen. Just boring and seemingly thrown together. Boring charactersPredictable storyline."
"424",4.5,"  I enjoyed watching this movie, great music and gave me tears in the end. It reminds of Family Importance, and never ever forget those people who left us in this world, especially members of the family, relatives, and friends. Keep them in our hearts... someday we will all meet again."
"425",4,"  So this film is basically Disney's version of the film ""The Book of Life"""
"426",5,"  Wonderful film, faultless!"
"427",5,"  Pixar does it again. Applying their formula to Mexican culture proved to be a success. Emotional, heartwarming, tear jerking story mixed the incredible animation provides one of Pixar's best films in recent years."
"428",5,"  I really love this movie :)??!"
"429",4,"  Beautifully animated with an amazing story; Coco is the best animated film of the year."
"430",3.5,"  I'm not big on CG animated movies, but it was different. Lots of nice visuals and a huge plot twist I didn't see coming. Major props for that."
"431",5,"  Best pixar flim I've ever seen."
"432",5,"  1/16/2018I watched this late in the game but did not read through any synopsis. But I heard tons of people who were brought to tears. I challenged myself not to cry but failed miserably. Could well be one of the best animated movies I've seen alongside Mulan."
"433",5,"  Inventive, colorful and genuinely moving, Coco adds another chapter to Pixar's rich filmography with a beautiful message about Family, memory and death."
"434",2,"  I'm honestly confused that this movie is getting the high marks that it is. I thought this was one of the worst movies Pixar has ever put out. I'm debating writing a big full review of this to explain exactly why, but for now - the music sucks (the songs and Giacchino's score which is one of his absolute worst), all the characters were the comedic relief, the acting was bleh, the story was shallow and formulaic, the jokes were all like Dreamworks level of ""satire,"" and even the character animation felt stock and lazy. I dunno, I didn't find much to like in this movie."
"435",5,"  y pensar que no soy fan de Disney/Pixar"
"436",5,"  I what this was an exceptionally bold movie from Pixar and it worked on every level. Incredible emotion and some nice twists which you might miss due to the great story telling.This is one I will enjoy again and again."
"437",5,"  It might seem like a daring move to make a 'children's' film about death - but yet again Pixar prove they can make a film about anything and still make it outstanding. With an original, sweet story, gorgeous visuals, wonderful music and genuine Mexican representation, Coco is a beautiful, magical film that can't fail to delight audiences worldwide - an absolute masterpiece. Bring some tissues, but get ready for one of your new favourites."
"438",3,"  Not a great movie, too obvious."
"439",4.5,"  A bright beautiful film that's filled with life, love and family. Truly touching, sweet and fun with some great music and a brilliant tribute to Dia de Muertos."
"440",5,"  Beautiful movie, most people in the cinema was craying at the end, especially adults."
"441",4,"  Disney has co-opted foreign, i.e. non-Caucasian, cultures for inspiration and materials before and it is a smart and lucrative thing to do especially for the international box office. Coco proves that Pixar can also play that game, but with more sophistication and finesse and thus we have their new animated feature based on the Mexican festival of El Dia de Los Muertos when families remember and pay respects to those who have passed away. Miguel is a young boy with music in his veins who rebels against his family of shoemakers who has banned music because his great-great-grandfather has abandoned them for fame and fortune as a musician. Unlike, say Moana, which can feel generic and plays too safe in its adaptation, Coco is not only more engrossing and thoughtful, it also evokes genuine emotional blubbery from its audience, i.e. me. Only a few songs feature, showing restraints on the filmmakers' part and they are enchanting and narratively relevant. For a film about death and dead people to look realistic yet will not give your average 6-year-olds nightmares, the visuals are imaginatively rendered with colours that explode gloriously on the screen, keeping the mood light and cheerful. The theme that family is important and will support you no matter what, is old-hat but universal enough, and thankfully, the lean and coherent script is entertaining, engaging and gets the story over without too many unnecessary detours, even managing a third act nod to telenovelas that feels right instead of jarring or over-melodramatic. With a refined sense of melancholic joy and well judged sentiments, it reminds me of Up, which just happens to be one of my favourite Pixar films."
"442",5,"  okay it made me cry ahh"
"443",5,"  Wow! This movie was the best of Disney beside ""Toy Story 3"" & ""Up"". It is so sad that I was crying so much at the ending part. Couldn't help it. I loves this movie so much that I watched it 3 times. Watched it 2 times in regular& then decided to watched it 3D before it is gone. But still wanna go & watch it again maybe in a real huge screen if they still have it. I think people would still go watch it if it's out the whole year long. Thanks Disney. Should make a ride out of this movie though."
"444",4.5,"  This is about on par for Pixar. It ultimately met my expectations, without really surpassing them. Thing is though, Pixar has set such a high standard for themselves, that just meeting their expectations is a pretty high compliment. Visually, it's incredible. The world of the dead is so detailed and vibrant and just fun to look at. Having a world full of skeleton people could potentially be a little macabre, but there's a fun and beauty to it that never feels creepy. The themes and story are also pretty strong. It's ultimately a movie about family, legacy, and traditions. The spark of the story is a family tradition that may be misguided, but it handles it without ever making the family seem villainous. It's a gorgeous movie with strong themes and a song that will definitely win the Oscar. It's not totally perfect though, there are a couple things that did bother me a little. For one, we once again have a third-act villain reveal, which really bothered me. It works well enough for the story, but it seemed unnecessary for a film that was doing great without one, and without getting into spoilers it's set up some character revelations that feel a little too coincidental. The movies also just not as funny as I would have liked. There's funny moments in it, but nothing that really cracked me up the way Inside Out or Finding Dory did. These are ultimately small issues, but for a studio with a track record like Pixar they do stick out. They hardly ruin the film though. At most, they just left me thinking ""oh, well that's unfortunate."" They keep Coco from hitting the top 5 Pixar movies for me, but it's still one of Pixar's better films. It's gorgeous to look at and emotionally moving, it follows Pixar's trend of stellar films."
"445",5,"  This movie is spectacular! It gives history on the Spanish culture and Dia Delos Muertos or Day of the Dead. Coco is the heart warming story of a boy named Miguel and his family. Miguel wants to play music, but his family hates music because his great-great-great grandfather left the family to play his music. Later we find out, Hector, the musician that left his family, was poisoned by his companion, De La Cruz, and unable to return home."
"446",5,"  Hello'I just recently watched  this movie and I believe that it is one of the best Pixar movies I have seen in quite a while. I liked the unique storyline and the magnificent artwork."
"447",4,"  Not the best that Pixar has offered but definitely a treat for the family ! Beautiful movie, a touching storyline full of music, color and the silly comedy that animated movies tend to offer ????"
"448",5,"  interesting, made me cry"
"449",5,"  That this is not the highest grossing film of all time everywhere is an absolute travesty. James Cameron wishes he could be this creative and this good of a storyteller."
"450",5,"  Was simply done really well. No flaws in the movie. Great for the family."
"451",4,"  Great film about family. Disney should have released this film in October to cash in on Dia De Los Muertos."
"452",5,"  One could argue that Pixar have lost their magic in recent years, but Coco is a reclamation of the reputation that they previously held - a beautiful, heartfelt film that will likely make you shed tears."
"453",5,"  Since I saw Inside Out and thought it was nothing like the original Pixar films, I thought that Coco would be worse at first. I decided to go and see the film this afternoon, thinking it would be good but not great.I watched it, and I have to admit, I was impressed. Despite a few awkward moments, the story is spectacular, and it goes well with its dazzling animation. Who needs a story of emotions inside your own head when this has got a beautiful story full of (as this site says) culture, family, life, death and MUSIC! I wish I could have made a film like that.It only goes to show that Disney and Pixar had not lost its ability to entertain. I'd see it again if I ever would have the chance and find a way to pay for it myself."
"454",4.5,"  Few films have managed to transmit their story as if were already happening as if their characters already existed in this world before the movie began and coco is one of them.The level of detail, the music and beautifully animated, the story is good and very strong for those who feel familiar with it, for others the approach can be repetitive."
"455",5,"  This movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. It's rich in detail and very colourful. I didn't know a lot about Mexico yet, so it was interesting. As a guitar player, I like the fact that what you see them play is actually matches what you hear (while in most movies, people who supposedly play the guitar just jerk away at the guitar while the music you hear doesn't match those movements at all). As a guitar player, I LOVED Hector's guitar and I would like to have it!"
"456",5,"  Visually beautiful and emotionally rich. I cried through many parts of this movie -- thinking of my ill mother, thinking of lost time and secrets. Coco visually captures small town Mexico and the love of family in Mexico. I cannot wait to see it again."
"457",4.5,"  funny good story. Oliver loved it."
"458",4,"  Great heartfelt movie!Well done Pixar! [8/10]"
"459",5,"  The best pixar film since Toy Story 3."
"460",0.5,"  I simply can't understand the hype for this movie. It is NOT a kids movie. Not meaning there's anything inappropriate in - I mean that it is BORING, especially for kids. Very little singing, no fun, relatable characters. none of the usual disney/pixar charm. Sad to say, we may have been better off seeing Ferdinand."
"461",5,"  This is pure cinematic gold. One of the best films ever made by Pixar, and one of the year's greatest movies."
"462",4.5,"  remember me..CocoLee Unkrich's witty and dramatic world of dead, works on all levels; from music to secrets, from drama to comedy, from kids to adults, Coco delivers the whole package where not only it's characters but range too works in its favor."
"463",4.5,"  With stunning animation and a touching, emotional story that respects Mexican culture - Pixar produces another big win with Coco."
"464",5,"  I loved watching this film, it was really heartfelt and interesting to watch."
"465",5,"  This is definitely one of the best animations as well as movies of all time."
"466",5,"  Absolutely fantastic! Probably one of my top 5 fave Pixar movies of all time!!! Hit me right in the feels!"
"467",2.5,"  Not the best from Pixar but still good enough. Not recommended tokids too young though. The dead all looked the same, not scary but not funny enough too."
"468",5,"  Pixar is widely regarded as one of, if not the, best animation studios in the world. With an extensive list of beloved films, and only a few that are considered subpar, they really do hold the highest standards in the industry. With that in mind, Coco is more than a worthy addition to the Pixar family. It takes place in Mexico and follows a child named Miguel, who dreams of being a musician despite his family's hatred thereof. On DÌa de los Muertos, he ventures into the Land of the Dead to seek his idol Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician he admires. Meanwhile, his ancestors try to return him to the Land of the Living, as he will die if he stays there too long. The story is very interesting, and keeps your attention quite well. The only real downside here is that if you've watched most of the recent Disney movies, some of the twists at the end will be rather predictable. Still, that's not enough to really detract from how good the movie actually is. As you can imagine, the music plays a major part in the story. ""Remember Me"" is one of the best Disney songs lately, and possibly one of Pixar's best tear-jerkers. Given that Pixar is known for that, that's no small feat. ""Un Poco Loco"" was very good as well. As with most Pixar movies, the characters are lovable, memorable, and well written. The characters, like real families, clearly love each other and wish the best for each other, despite the conflicts they have. That realism with the characters is one of the movie's strengths. Because of that, most of the story doesn't have a proper villain, because Miguel's family - living and dead, care for him dearly. The animation is some of the best ever made, which is to be expected coming from Pixar. The Land of the Dead looks spectacular and imaginative, and the color scheme is beautiful. The imagery that appears in D√≠a de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico is shown here, and the way its reflected in the character designs for the dead is fantastic. The accuracy that goes into characters playing guitar is also outstanding. This is easily one of Pixar's best movies. And that's really saying something.It is also worth noting that Olaf's Frozen Adventure, the short before the movie, was way out of place. It wouldn't be bad as a TV special, but it's not the type of thing you want be stuck sitting through prior to the movie. Still, that doesn't detract from Coco itself."
"469",2.5,"  This movie is blah. All it is is up and brave put together. Then they put situations or people that most people have in there life and fool u in to thinking that it's a good film. If u like Pixar movies then watch it me there last good movie was walle and it's been going down ever since #moviepass"
"470",5,"  must watch, incredible, brilliant, touching...simply outstanding"
"471",5,"  I got very into this movie. It was way more emotional than I expected. Bring a tissue. Fantastic movie."
"472",5,"  Beautiful movie.. I love it!"
"473",5,"  At times breathtaking, and heart warming throughout. This has jumped to the upper echelon on Pixar movies for sure. Coco is the best story about the importance of family that I have experienced in a long long time. And I left the theater thinking of ways that I could be a better son, grandson, cousin, etc. I cant think of many things in life, much less movies, that have had that effect on me. There are flaws to find if you look really hard, but it would be the same as scouring a canvas for stray brush strokes. Doing so would make you miss the point. Instant classic movie for sure and an 'A+' from me."
"474",5,"  Coco shows how Pixar got into perfection. Full of colors, music and love. Perfection...."
"475",4.5,"  Come in tanti altri suoi film la Pixar dimostra di poter produrre capolavori sia per grandi che per piccoli. Coco √® la giusta proporzione tra intrattenimento visivo per bambini ed emozioni sincere e profonde per un pubblico adulto di tutte le et√†. Questa volta ci viene proposta una storia in stile messicano che esplora temi molto delicati e difficili da raccontare, riuscendo per√≤ a mantenere un alto livello di seriet√† senza sfociare in risvolti banali e prevedibili come troppo spesso accade.Visivamente il film √® incredibile, una vera e propria gioia per gli occhi, pieno di colori e di elementi di una fantasia infinita. E' sotto l'aspetto emotivo che il film colpisce di pi√π, grazie a colpi di scena inaspettati ed un finale veramente toccante che commuove con gran facilit√†. Insieme ad Up e Toy Story 3, questo √® tra gli ultimi migliori film della Pixar."
"476",5,"  Wonderful movie for all ages! I love it when an animated movie sheds light on other cultures for kids to become acquainted with allowing for a fun learning experience. The songs are memorable and the plot is heart wrenching with a great twist you only see in the best animated story lines. A+ from me for Coco"
"477",2.5,"  Spectacularly colourful with a sweet, (albeit predictable) path. Certainly not a misfire from Pixar, but also did not appeal to me personally in the way that many of their other films have."
"478",5,"  at first I thought I would not like it but after a while I started liking it mor and more"
"479",5,"  Coco is a unique movie. In which almost everything in the story connects and is interwoven with one another. The biggest thing that stood out for me in this movie are the themes and motifs used in this movie. Every little detail in the beginning of the movie comes back later in the movie as a motif, a variation, or a twist. The roles all the characters play are incredibly interesting. Form protagonist to antagonist, everyone has a purpose in the story, they all have something to learn, and they all have more layers to them then meets the eye. One thing I love is that there is not one antagonist in this movie and the role of the antagonist switch from character to character and motive to motive. Another favorite of mine in the movie is the color. This movie is colorful and beautiful. The details in the animation are incredibly detailed, both in the world and the characters.In conclusion, Coco is a masterpiece. I feel this a movie where if I see it again, I'll catch even more things I didn't pick up on on the first watch. 4.8/5 Stars"
"480",5,"  It's a good movie.this movie. despite being predictable, it is still good and the experience is unforgettable.to remember."
"481",5,"  Original, lovable, and memorable. It's got twists and turns and a brilliant message. The best Pixar film I've seen since Toy Story."
"482",5,"  this movie proves that pixar does some pretty remarkable stuff when it comes to making you emotional and at the same time delivering joy, a great original movie with that is a must watch film of 2017"
"483",5,"  Beautiful movie, it shows a very accurate research about mexican culture. Family, music and dreams are a key component of this movie."
"484",5,"  Great movie overall for kids and parents."
"485",5,"  I loved it.it made me cry.Love"
"486",5,"  For the greater part of the 21st Century, Pixar has consistently delivered some of the most original & heartfelt stories that entire families can enjoy together. ""COCO"" is one of the best films to come from the beloved animation studio, & thoroughly captures all the heart & imagination of its' best pieces, in addition to a refreshing new introduction of solely human characters. Here, the significance of an important national holiday, Dia de los Muertes, is carefully celebrated rather than exploitatively fantasized. The focus here is on the strength of the family and the beauty of remembrance, with the role of fantasy used to connect audiences to their own family legacies. Music plays an integral role, & stunning colorful imagery ties it all together. This is arguably the best film of 2017."
"487",5,"  Yes, Pixar's back baby"
"488",4.5,"  pixar did it again!!with a stunning visual and incredible animation. pixar once again give us a thoughtful film to discuss the true meaning of a family.this nearly perfect film might not be pixar's best work, but it sure did bring pixar back to their level."
"489",5,"  Incredibly touching, COCO is one of the best animations ever done!"
"490",5,"  The best Pixar movie ever and I'm only 12"
"491",4.5,"  Wow! Pixar made it again. This company is on another level for making animated movies in my opinion. I really enjoyed all the movie and the songs were really awesome. I think this movie has an amazing message and it really manage the death theme really really well. Btw, fan of Pepita here ;)"
"492",5,"  5 star's all the way. Great animation great story great music. Made a tear come to my eye check it out on big screen before it leaves the theater you will enjoy."
"493",3.5,"  Prepare your handkerchiefs! This is surely the sweetest and technologically most advanced cartoon in 10 or 20 years, maybe even of all times. The visuals of huge open scenes are surely unparalleled. This is Mexico pure, with all its heart and craziness! Thumbs up for the director and scriptwriter. And go prepared as I was not the only man trying to wash off those red eyes in the bathroom afterwards. I think it got to everybody inside the theater. 7 1/2 out of 10 points."
"494",4.5,"  Pixar does it again, Coco is excellent all around! The music, characters, cinematography, and plot were all just excellent. Pixar has really come out with some amazing movies, and Coco is no exception. The trailer did not have me pre ordering tickets to see it, but boy did it delight and surprise me once I made it to the theatre. I was nervous for how Mexico was going to be portrayed, and if this would be a story too violent or grown up for young children but Pixar does a phenomenal job of bringing Mexico's culture to life in such a beautiful way, and tying in multiple themes throughout the movie that even kids can pick up on. Although this won't get the praise that Moana or Zootopia did, this movie was enjoyable from start to finish, and I can't wait to see it again!"
"495",5,"  Brilliant movie suitable for all ages. Probably my favourite Pixar now"
"496",5,"  This movie was great for the whole fam - very clever and fun with a good message."
"497",5,"  It touches the heart and gives a very real glimpse to the very real world of The Remembered. While it is deeply rooted in tradition, it shows a range of actors that actually have some ties to the story being told. °Orale!"
"498",5,"  Very awesome animated movie,the best i have ever watch,hope incredibles become good too"
"499",5,"  The animation in the film is beautiful that has such an emotional acpect and really gives a message of upon life and death and gives a lot of interests of love as well. I would recomend for all ages that is a magical adventure i enjoyed."
"500",4,"  Tiene un bonito mensaje sobre la festividad de los muertos."
"501",5,"  This Movie Is Beautiful and Awesome and Great and Good"
"502",5,"  Probably the most underrated film of the season. We're so used to Pixar churning out this stuff that it's become normal, and then a terrific film like Coco comes along and it is hardly noticed. A charming story that brings the audience to tears and spontaneous applause. Entertaining, wonderfully animated, genuinely funny and, once again, a great yarn."
"503",4.5,"  Absolutely loved this movie! Great writing and beautiful animation."
"504",5,"  BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"505",5,"  Favorite movie I've seen in so long! Wonderful, unique story and so well-made. Go see Coco now!!!"
"506",5,"  Great story, funny and so well made! I went by myself and I am a mature adult. Enjoyed it a lot."
"507",5,"  This is quite possibly one of the most gorgeous, touching, well-made films Pixar has ever released, and it is certainly my favorite since Tangled. I was not expecting anything quite so fulsilling when I walked into the theater; I was hoping to relax with a cute movie that maybe I'd watch again someday, if it was on. What I was presented with was something that moved me to tears, not only as a young person but as an aspiring artist. I raved about this movie for days after to anyone that would listen, and it took everything in my power not to spoil everything about it in my excitement. I would absolutely recommend this movie for people of ALL AGES. Young people will love the beautiful visuals, interesting characters, and fun music, whereas older audiences will fall in love with the rich storyline and intricate plot twists. It is so refreshing to see a film that is truly built from pure, raw, unadulterated passion. Even the music has a natural, organic feel, unlike the processed songs we've gotten from Disney in the past. This is a must-see."
"508",4.5,"  For a Disney/Pixar film the premise is very dark but dealt with in a range of ways, the underlying story of the family bond, that family love is unconditional and Miguel on his hunt to gain respect from his fore fathers/mothers. Resulting in a great plot twist unravelling murder, deceit and a truly emotional coming together of ""lost"" family that had me in tears. A beautifully crafted Disney Pixar film that deserves to win an Oscar for best animation."
"509",4,"  A beautifully made story about transcendence and not renouncing to your dreams"
"510",5,"  Great movie and fun for everybody in the family. As much as I love Pixar storytelling, from the previews I thought this was just going to be a rip of Book of Life. It definitely was not. The similarities are there in the imagery, but the story itself is very different, more emotional, and simply a different movie."
"511",5,"  This movie is hands down the best movie of this year and I dare say the best movie that Disney has ever created. As a non Mexican man I throughly enjoyed the informative aspect of the Day of dead and how it didn't ever feel like they were giving us a a lesson. They did a wonderful job of misdirecting and show us what we wanted to see and not what was really happening. I almost legitimately cried about 5 times.I wish i could give this movie more than 5 stars but sadly I can't. I'm preordering this movie immediately so I can always watch it. #RememberMe"
"512",4.5,"  Maybe the best Pixar movie, ever."
"513",5,"  Excellent movie, great story-line, writing, plotpoints, characters and so much more. Beautifully made and unique. Well done!"
"514",0.5,"  This just shows societies downfall into darkness and all these reviews that everyone is saying it is great, are clearly attemps to make the movie seem better then it could ever actually be! It was honestly crap and absurdly offensive me and my daughter will not be watching anything from Pixar ever again!"
"515",0.5,"  Rip-off of The Book of Life, which it is not as good as. This, following Disney's attempt to trademark 'day of the dead' a couple years back, which controversy they successfully swept under the rug. Short memories, and copy cat ideas will likely still gain the adoration and $ of the very group they aim to assimilate into their corporate machine. A decent mess, but still a mess all around. But really, Watch the book of life instead."
"516",5,"  The most emotive movie from Pixar. The colours, the songs, the jokes... I really loved it"
"517",5,"  Most beautiful Pixar movie to date <3 :'("
"518",3,"  good music, visuals, and settings, but the story is weak"
"519",5,"  Authentic and lovable!"
"520",5,"  I hadn't found a new movie to add to my top-5 favorite list in over 20 years, but Coco changed that. Considering that incredible accomplishment, it's hard to overstate just how great I think this movie is."
"521",4.5,"  Another original story with a great message once again from Pixar, good songs, well worth watching but scary for young children."
"522",5,"  One of the best movie I've watched so far!"
"523",5,"  The best movie ever..."
"524",5,"  I laughed and cried so much. It was a wonderful, well written film. I'm not one to post on rotten tomatoes, but I just had to let you know how great this was, for Mexicans, and Americans interested in Latin culture."
"525",4,"  coco is another great film to add to the Pixar collection. The animation is stunning as always and it is amazing to see how much animation has changed in the past decade or so. the voice cast is great and are really enthusiastic about their given roles and the musical numbers are awesome, the songs will most likely be stuck in your head for the next week. Coco is a great film and a must see for families and Pixar fans."
"526",3.5,"  The colors are stunning, there are a couple truly surprising plot twists, and a potent emotional punch. But I think the mechanics of the story are overly familiar, and the resolution is never truly in any doubt. Coco's a good movie, and a sweet one, but not on the same level as the best Disney or Pixar films."
"527",5,"  Fantastic movie. Great story and unparalleled character background development. Coco is by far my favorite movie now."
"528",5,"  Wonderful for all ages"
"529",4.5,"  Amazing visuals, colorful imagery, heartwarming music, along with its inspiring tale, endearing characters and family friendly humor, Coco is a complete package as an animation franchise."
"530",5,"  A Pixar conseguiu o improv·vel, superar o maravilhosos Toy Story 3. Sens√≠vel e lindo sem ser piegas"
"531",4.5,"  This movie was one of the most touching, heartbreaking (in my opinion) yet meaningful animated movie in this decade."
"532",0.5,"  Hackneyed story.....they just made movie in 2014 like this...."
"533",4.5,"  Mostly good movie and story, just a few things that were annoying, but good over all."
"534",5,"  A beautiful celebration of culture. I am Mexican-American and the accuracy of many of the details in this film were spot-on. It made me appreciate it even more because of it. Can't wait to own this movie on DVD!!"
"535",4,"  The last time I went to the movie theater for an animated feature it was Finding Dory and before that I don't remember. I can't remember one I enjoyed as much as Coco in a long time, that's for sure. I loved the Mexican story (Disney's first Latino-influenced film right?), clever plot twist, the animation, the characters, basically everything. It brought tears to my eyes more than once, which earns it my 4 star rating. Although It felt slightly too long, I am so glad my friend made me go because I had no intention of seeing this movie!!"
"536",4,"  A sweet story, if somewhat predictable. I found that I would have liked to see Miguel's interact more with his known family (Imelda, hus aunts and uncles, his living family, ect.) more before he split up from them to go look for Ernesto de la Cruz, but I did enjoy the interactions he did have with them. I think my favorite moment in the entire movie was at the end, when he was with Mama Coco, and I wish his first interaction with her had been more like that. But the visuals were stunning, and while I initially thought the skull designs were odd, they worked perfectly fine. Overall a good movie, and one that children will certainly enjoy."
"537",5,"  Heartfelt story and visually entertaining. The best animated film of 2017."
"538",4.5,"  Coco (Super Quick Movie Review)...It's been a while since I last watched a ""Pixar"" movie...Last time I watched a Pixar film, there's just too many onions, man!. Yes! Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm talking about ""Inside Out"". Hehe! .This is their latest film, and I really enjoyed it...It has a wonderful message at the ending that's very heartwarming...I can't say anything else about the plot, just please, if you have a spare time watch this movie with your family. It's going to be awesome! .For that, I'm going to rate the film a 9.8 out of 10 :)"
"539",5,"  Excelente pel√≠cula con un gran mensaje."
"540",4.5,"  06/01/2018 Hoyts Woonona"
"541",4,"  A taboo theme such as death is seen through another lence. Nice film."
"542",3,"  Bravo to the studio for branching out and finally giving exposure to such a rich and beautiful culture with such an aesthetically pleasing film. Unfortunately the unsurprising twist and disappointing score, especially for a movie centered on music, do diminish the rush of the experience."
"543",5,"  there is no other movie in animation's section in 2017 like this"
"544",5,"  The story is engaging and moving. Everything set up is paid off and it's full of twists. The script is very well done, the visuals are great and the music complements the whole thing nicely. I went to watch this film with high expectations and wasn't disappointed at all."
"545",4,"  Many story threads in Coco are familiar, but that doesn't detract from the stellar animation and touching message."
"546",5,"  Not what I was expecting going into a Pixar movie, BUT my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised! First, this movie is a bit deep, but in all the best ways! Neither of us speak Spanish or grew up knowing much about day of the dead and I felt this movie shed light on the beautiful tradition of remembering your ancestors. This movie tugs at your heart strings as we saw throughout the theater. I think this is a very important movie for children and adults a like to never forget their relatives and understand the importance of family."
"547",5,"  Really good movie!!!"
"548",5,"  Best animated movie i've seen in years! it's so meaningful and powerful and can bring you easily into tears"
"549",5,"  Plot has a good twist!"
"550",5,"  Coco will be remembered as one of Pixar's greatest with its intricate, colorful animation musicality and heartwarming story. This one will hit home with many families for years to come."
"551",5,"  Amazing! I laughed. I cried. I bought the soundtrack.Will be a great addition to my ever growing Disney collection. In truth, it's one of the bests I've seen. It perfectly revolved around family and independence without being cheesy or lacking adventure."
"552",4,"  I loved this movie. I am Mexican myself so I could connect to so many things :)"
"553",3.5,"  This felt like just a solid love letter to Mexico and I was pretty down with that. Finally a simple story with focused characters and no goofy talking animals shoved in or tangental side stories or one off bad guys or manipulative tear jerkers (well ok some of that but at least they laid all of the ground work for it and legitimized it's existence with the plot). Enjoyable movie, catchy music, great colors, skeletons.Biggest complaint is the misuse of Jaime Camil - we all know he shoulda been De La Cruz."
"554",5,"  It's my favourite pixar now. Everything set up is paid off and it's full of twists. The story captures the Mexican cultural background and I was inmersed into the world of the story."
"555",4,"  You will see the ""twist"" ending coming a mile away. Still a fun journey."
"556",2,"  Not for kids. This is not a movie for young children but more for older kids and adults."
"557",5,"  Great family movie that reminds you of the importance of keeping the memories of loved ones alive."
"558",1,"  Best Disney movie I've ever seen. Inspiring and heartwarming."
"559",5,"  I never cry during movies and this had me sobbing"
"560",5,"  muy buena casi lloraba se los recomiendo"
"561",3,"  Fun and entertaining."
"562",5,"  the movie made me confused but the ending is amazing"
"563",1.5,"  Very touching and beautifully colorful. Recommend."
"564",5,"  Lovely characters, full of colour, music and passion. Every tear have a meaning."
"565",5,"  ASSISTA A ESSA OBRA DE ARTE DA PIXAR! FaÁa um favor a si mesmo! Tocante, inteligente, emocionante, fofo, lindo..."
"566",5,"  An absolutely stunning film filled to the brim with beautiful imagery, poignant music, and heart."
"567",5,"  Great movie! Took my kids to see it and they loved it too. I thought maybe the skeletons would scare them, but they were fine. Weeks later, they are STILL singing ""Remember Me."""
"568",4.5,"  I cried more than my girlfriend. Pixar does it again!"
"569",5,"  The emotional story of a boy who longs to be a musician, but his family forbids it. He journeys to the land of the dead to meet his idol and great-grandfather and get his blessing to escape, and be able to play music. A must see for all Pixar fans."
"570",4.5,"  Pixar does it again in this visually stunning instant classic that teaches the importance of family and following your dreams."
"571",5,"  Will surely make you cry, learn and enjoy life through a journey in the land of the dead"
"572",5,"  For me the best animation movie ever!Coco is a movie that take you in a journey through mexican culture, through music, life and death, but most of all it shows what family is all about!Coco managed to teach the foundation of families and showed how mexican keep their loved ones in their memories long after their death.For me the best animation movie of all time with an AMAZING narrative and fantastics visuals.You won't find any better than this"
"573",4,"  Despite a second act that devitalizes this flick to a certain degree, Coco delivers a lively, emotional punch while considering weighty themes like memory, family, and the afterlife. Giacchino's score and astounding animation are the icing on the cake."
"574",5,"  Everything about this movie was amazing. The visuals, the plot, the songs, everything. I can honestly say that I came into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about what it was about, and came out of the movie deciding that it was in my top 5 favorite Pixar movies...maybe even my favorite!I was always on the edge of my seat because the plot was just so interesting. The movie really captures Dia de Los Muertos REALLY well with great explanations and visuals and the characters are incredibly relatable. The last 30 minutes of the movie just had me in tears. I truly enjoyed this film."
"575",4.5,"  Coco is a kids movie that ACTUALLY has a really good message, and ACTUALLY has a really good story, that'll work really well for people of all ages. It's what Disney's sold themselves as, both genuinely and fraudulently, on so many other movies. Helps that the cast & crew did a fantastic job after the writing too."
"576",5,"  What a gorgeous movie. In my opinion Pixar's best yet. I fully expect this movie to win a few awards come Oscar time. Brilliant animation and storytelling."
"577",5,"  Great Movie! Really stuck an emotional chord (no pun intended)."
"578",2,"  As far as Pixar movies go, I thought ti was pretty average. Great ending, but not a whole lot of fun, and the plot itself was a bit of a mess. Definitely won't be a movie my kids will be talking about for months after or wanting to purchase on DVD etc....in fact, I think they've already forgotten about it."
"579",5,"  One of my favorite movies of 2017, made me cry, and I still tear up whenever I hear the Remember Me (Reunion) song!"
"580",4,"  Is this a remake of Book of Life? It looks and sounds the same, and have the same theme of Mexican legends and a trip to the land of the dead. Its not really a remake, as the basic story is different, but it definitely is a sister movie that build on the success of the previous movie. Its also made by a different studio, but its still relies heavily on the same pallet. What it does better is to anchor it more firmly into Mexican culture and traditions by focusing on the value of family. It highlights and utilizes the good side of Americans duality relationship towards Mexico. It is also an excellent family movie, as it really is a movie about family made for every member of the family. Best seen with your children and spouse in a theater near you as soon as possible."
"581",4,"  this movie was perfect"
"582",4,"  My movie review verdict in Ten words: And the Oscar for best animated film goes to...Maravilloso."
"583",4,"  I cried twice in this movie. The animation is amazing. Good surprises, good characters, and a good protagonist. It's not perfect but my biggest complaints can be justified easily with the phrase ""it's a kids movie. Not saying that adults can't enjoy just saying that those problems are not hard to notice. Love it tho"
"584",3,"  not going to state the obvious that the movie bears significant similarities to another animated film, but as with any Pixar movie, I was moved by the story and the attention to detail."
"585",4,"  Well done, attractive, likeable, and relate-able but no memorable songs."
"586",5,"  was a great story and well made movie"
"587",3.5,"  Well crafted and not pandering. Culturally self aware. Made me miss my home town and extended family. It got me right in the feels."
"588",3.5,"  Very Pretty, but the story is very meh until towards the end. Still pretty predictable. Of course pixar has found a way to rip the tears from me still."
"589",5,"  This was just the most beautiful story about family, love, forgiveness and believing in yourself. I attended with my wife and two young daughters and i was bawling my eyes out by the end. The love between a father and his daughter is a beautiful thing to behold. It's so gentle and fragile and this was illustrated superbly by the movie. Thank you for moving me in such a profound way."
"590",2,"  Payasada de la industrializada Pixar para poner, en spanglish, una muy ridÌcula versi√≥n de el d√≠a de los muertos en M√©xico. Un conjunto de clich√©s sin par en una historia aburrida y vergonzosa."
"591",4.5,"  A Pixar movie firing on all cylinders. Both visually engaging and full of heart. Parents of younger kids might want to reflect on how the afterlife is presented here and the implications thereof. It's funny how the Mexican land of the dead has better border security than Mexico."
"592",5,"  Can I add more stars?! Went to see it twice already. This movie is perfect, and I never use that word lightly. It js a celebration of music, family, childhood and color. Finally, Pixar made a musical! It is the best of the world of Disney musical prowess and Pixar's genius storytelling. SUPERB. If you haven't seen it, come out of hibernation and go to the movies!"
"593",4.5,"  Heartwarming tale about a boy, his love for music and importance of family... fighting to right past wrongs and to restore the memory of his family member.. Story is and movie both are beautiful pieces of art, boldly painting in allo the colours and emotions in the palette to create colourfull emotional tale suited for all ages...I Highly recommend this to anyone who loves Pixars more detailed tales."
"594",5,"  Truly a good movie. One the of the movies that are rarely made and deserve the best rating."
"595",5,"  3, 4, 5 times, ??????"
"596",5,"  Disney's cinema magic continues in this easy to love family adventure"
"597",3.5,"  Wonderful story with a heartfelt message."
"598",5,"  All the feels!! Such a beautiful film!! Get ready to shed some tears!"
"599",4.5,"  I hadn't read any reviews going into it, just the high rating on this site, and that one publication picked a key scene near the end as one of its 'moment's of the year' in film. Even with its twists and turns, I could feel we were headed toward something that would bring the waterworks (it is a Pixar movie, so you know the heartstrings will be pulled with all their might). The combination of color, texture, lovingly serving up Mexican culture for everyone to appreciate in a joyful way balanced the at-its-heart heavy nature - its a movie about death. And a wonderful one it is, and I would agree that the moment I mentioned earlier is a powerful moment in this year's cinema (the sniffing and a few stifled sobs were audible in my showing). Pixar is consistent, and they're able to balance more adult and emotional themes than Disney can."
"600",5,"  Miguel will inspire you to follow your call. The film explores dreams and the meaning of family bonds."
"601",4.5,"  Pixar embraces Mexican culture and delivers a beautifully animated well told classic."
"602",5,"  Mi pelÌcula favorita del a√±o y adem√°s una de las mejores de Disney/Pixar. Bestialmente perfecta."
"603",5,"  The previews do not do it justice!!! This movie was absolutely incredible! There was not a single moment where I was not completely mesmerized. The story was AWESOME and so touching. I just cannot get over how good this movie was!"
"604",4,"  With a emotional story, lovable characters, a surprising depth and a touching message that nobody should ignore, ""Coco"" may not be a Pixar's masterpiece but it ranks among the studio's finest offerings (in my opinion). As a native from the country which holiday it inspired, I have to say it made me love Pixar even more! Rating: 8.4 out of 10."
"605",5,"  Coco is one of those animation movies that are only apparently made for children. It talks about death, love and suffer in a setting full of colors and traditions which will touch your soul."
"606",5,"  We're a family of 4, with girls 9 and 11. And, we have a great grandmother who's 101, who was orphaned in 1921. This movie was powerfully good, extremely well done."
"607",5,"  Great animation and very good story."
"608",5,"  Great film. Anyone comparing it to the Book of Life clearly did not watch this film. Very accurate cultural touchstones that do not rely purely on outdated stereotypes. If you have a pulse, bring tissues. Moving film."
"609",5,"  Ok I have to admit there were some reservations going into this movie but Disney knocked this one out of park. The animation and music was great with it's story touching the right heart strings. I would not be surprised for best animation Oscar nod on this movie."
"610",5,"  Filled with emotional moments and beautiful world building. True artwork."
"611",5,"  It's a tear jerker. Beautiful scenes. Plot twists. amazing animation."
"612",0.5,"  doesn't have anything to do with chocolate smh"
"613",5,"  Best Pixar movies since Toy Story"
"614",4.5,"  (4.5/5). While I wouldn't put it amongst the Pixar heavyweights, Coco is still a great animated movie, one with strong characters, colorful visuals, a fantastic soundtrack and an engaging story. I'd argue its final twenty minutes trip up the movie a little, but by the end its one Pixar movie that you'll never forget."
"615",5,"  Best movie I've seen in a long time. Such a touching story."
"616",4,"  Wow!!What a fantastic movie,filled with beautiful animation,songs and most of all,an interesting story.Coco is beautifully animated movie that just made me just stare in shock of how colorful it is.My only problem is the pacing can change,at times I felt the movie was slower than other moments.Coco is a good,enjoyable movie for the entire family"
"617",5,"  So good this movie is super good."
"618",3.5,"  Pixar;s storytelling is starting to get a little stale, but it's still storytelling and the visuals are beautiful. I had to sit through the Frozen Christmas Special feature and that was very painful."
"619",5,"  Ah... Pixar You've done it again. This magically, magnificent, marvelous and masterfully animated film directed by Toy Story 3's Lee Unkrich is not only an outstanding visually authentic and unique in style, it's also deeply affectionate and endearing when examining it's cultural contextual nature and hugely impactful themes focusing on life, death and the meaning of family relationship's. Not once did I feel this film was going off the rails of it's outstanding plotting, bringing in all the goods a great story needs set within an authentic world full of imaginative ideas and laws, much like it's outstanding musical score and song lyrics being a great sub-text for the film. I adored the film and can't recommend it highly enough to even both children and adults who'll equally cry during the most moving and intimate moments of the film. Overall, laugh, cry, smile and enjoy this outstanding achievement Pixar has created being another one of their greatest ever animated films ever made especially within the ever growing and innovative realm of compute generated 3D animation that shows the world Pixar are still the greatest pioneers of it's medium, both animation and conceptually story-wise beyond any belief."
"620",4.5,"  Best Pixar film since Toy Story 3. Great story and animation!"
"621",4.5,"  COCO is a wonderful film. Although it is somewhat predictable and has a plot structure similar to previous Pixar films (particularly MONSTERS INC and UP), it is fabulously well animated, realized and acted; Pixar's crown as the top animation studio remains firmly in place; this is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen."
"622",5,"  Sensational - Sensacional !!"
"623",3,"  I'm not too excited when my sister asked me to watch this movie with her maybe because i was bored with animation movie, just same old story about family with a different background, but i cried nonetheless :D Coco is a good story after all, interesting to know about Mexican culture and their believe. What i learned and what everybody should to from this movie is stop assuming and find the truth. But even when we can't find the truth ourselves it's really the best to listen to what our parents/elders say (not always though but most of the time) because at the end of the day they only want the best for you and won't let you to get hurt (:"
"624",5,"  The most risky movie of Pixar, therefore the most respected. My respects for the creators that were beyond a story, those emotions that we experience in Coco, are the result of impeccable research. Of the best Pixar movies"
"625",5,"  Is the best movie of this year 2017, fresh humor and a good message"
"626",4.5,"  Excellent Pixar film. Funny (and forgiveably silly at times) while at the same time full of heart and depth. There are some quite stunning visuals too. A little lethargic at times but overall a great movie. You aren't likely to leave the theater disappointed."
"627",5,"  I'd give it six stars if I could..."
"628",5,"  Colourful,full of music,heartwarming.Totally Best movie of 2017"
"629",4.5,"  Holy cow, another piece of modern art from Pixar. First of all, this film sounds and looks beautiful. It is a much different movie than Pixar has ever tried to do, even with the amount of creativity that flows from their films. I got to be honest, the trailers didn't wow me, but I usually see Pixar movies in theaters and I am so glad I did this time. The message about family vs fame was amazing, the mariachi-inspired music was catchy and wonderful, and the characters were well-rounded. The action setpieces weren't the best this studio has ever done, but they were plenty entertaining. Just when you think the movie was getting predictable, they throw that twist at you. For those who aren't psychic, you probably won't be able to predict it. Of course with any Pixar film, there are tear-jerking moments. What got me most of all was Hector singing ""Remember Me"" as a lullaby to his daughter. Go see this movie. No review of it will ever do it justice in my eyes. However, prepare for kind of a weak beginning with not the best dialogue and a repetition of the summary. From there, it's an adventurous and emotional ride."
"630",5,"  Such a great story - a must see film by entire family as a group. Music is just outstanding, with such a perfect job with the English performance, almost matching the sensational Spanish performace."
"631",5,"  Interesting story, beautiful songs and unexpected plot-twists. One of the best Disney movies I have ever seen."
"632",4,"  Pixar delivers again with a visually impressive, emotional, and ultimately entertaining movie with strong themes and great animation."
"633",4.5,"  An interesting dive into Mexico's lore."
"634",4.5,"  So each year we receive from Disney's Pixar division a new animated movie. But is this movie ever a masterpiece? I daresay no, because I personally didn't appreciate Moana last year. I saw Coco on 28th December, which is the day Coco was first projected in my country and yes, I can definetly shout ""MASTERPIECE!"" for different reasons: firstly, the places where this movie is set. I mean a small village in Mexico, so it was necessary to represent some traditions, like the Dia de los Muertos. This years Disney has been capable of recreating popular tradition very clearly (by the way, I think Moana has represented Polynesian traditions terribly). After that, I really loved characters' depth. I mean, even if Coco is an animated movie, there are deep and the really good thing is that they change, so the anatgonists have become helpers, the helpers have become antagonists but always it ends up with a happy ending; I'm not always in favour of an happy ending, even if we're talking about an animated movie. I think that kids could be educated with movies and films shouldn't always have an ending like ""oh everyone is cheerful and happy ok go with the credits goodbye"" because in real life there aren't unfortunatelly many happy endings. On the other side, I'm in favour of Disney-ended movies, because Disney has managed to make generations dream so all in all I give Coco four stars and a half, because I think they should have given to the less important characters more depth."
"635",5,"  Marvellous movie.... So beautiful"
"636",5,"  Wonderful story line. The visualisation is awesome. The story and the importance to music and the twist at the end is totally mind blowing."
"637",5,"  this movie was really good. i would def see it again. story was well made. dont really care much about the day of the dead stuff but its a pixar movie so i had to see it. very good."
"638",3,"  The first third of the movie had me completely captured-- easily 4 to 4.5 stars based on the beginning. The last third caught me surprise. Even though I predicted the ending, I still ended up crying. Everyone was right about that part; it does tug on the heartstrings. It was the middle third that took my rating down. It was very dark, and it dragged and dragged and dragged. Overall a good film-- better if they could have done something about the middle."
"639",5,"  The best movie ever! So emotional! Perfect representation of mexican culture So colorful ! Full of life and love The music is extraordinary! You get so nostalgic and makes you fell that you can do anything if your family support you"
"640",5,"  Great movie in everyway"
"641",5,"  Probably Pixar's finest work yet."
"642",5,"  Increible pelicula! Proxima ganadora de muchos premios Oscar!"
"643",5,"  The fantastic animation and the cultural effect input into the movie makes Coco a 5 star film."
"644",5,"  Loved this movie, and enjoyed that there were hardly any kids in the audience so we weren't the only adults wanting to enjoy a Pixar movie. Day of the Dead means a whole lot more to me now than it did before."
"645",5,"  Best pixar movie so far."
"646",5,"  Maybe the best movie of Pixar"
"647",5,"  Coco is a Pixar masterpiece ! I truly enjoyed this film. Everyone should see this movie !!!"
"648",0.5,"  Worst Disney Pixar film"
"649",5,"  An imaginative and inviting movie that will have songs stuck in your head for weeks. The film is one of the most beautiful I have even seen!"
"650",5,"  This movie is astounding! The elaborate visuals and rich cultural themes gives this movie much respect in the animation department as well as complementing the meaning and story of the movie. The story plot of this movie was very well written; it created a sense of pride for the Mexican culture, as well as a story to appeal to anyone of whatever race. The story had many well written turns and changes, and the plot never strayed away to something random. It also had a beautiful moment of emotion, something that was expected for a Disney movie, but never to have imagined it in the way it was betrayed in the movie. The music, like every Pixar animated film, was beautiful and effected viewers emotionally, however, in this movie the music had an importance in the plot as well, which mixed perfectly with the cultural theme as well. I absolutely loved this movie when I watched it in theaters on Thanksgiving Day, the exact day it came out, and the pride of our Mexican heritage and mood that was given to my family and I was the best experience we could ever ask for!"
"651",5,"  Fantastic movie! Everyone should see this!"
"652",4.5,"  Coco is yet another beautifully told story by Pixar. It was almost flawless, though it doesn't reach the heights of other Pixar accomplishments such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or Ratatouille."
"653",3.5,"  Good movie but all the day of the dead stuff is weird"
"654",5,"  Absolutely brilliant family film."
"655",5,"  Awesome movie. Great visuals and story!"
"656",5,"  My favorite movie of the holiday season!"
"657",5,"  Beautifully crafted in the colourful culturalmexican folklore of the day of the day with a captivating story our family loved it."
"658",4,"  Excellent animation, a moving story, great music."
"659",4,"  Once again Pixar proves that they can make extremely good movies!!"
"660",5,"  Such a wonderful movie! Not a dry eye in the house by the end."
"661",5,"  perfect film. there is absolutely nothing i would change on this film. its very rare that i would ever say this about any film. the story, the characters, the visuals, music, tone and culture on this film are off the charts. bravo"
"662",3,"  It's hard for me to look at a Pixar movie as just another movie. The computer animation company has built such a remarkable run of quality work that it feels like something more than just a string of hit cartoons. Pixar movies combine heart, humor, pathos and great art unlike any other company on the planet. Toy Story, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, and the like aren't just any other kids movie, they are highly regarded works of art. https://geeks.media/movie-review-coco?_ga=2.261548493.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710"
"663",4.5,"  Beautiful, loved it. It nailed down central Mexican culture."
"664",5,"  Beautiful Movie! Incredibly relatable to Hispanic Culture! In Live with it, cannot wait to buy it!"
"665",5,"  Probably the most beautiful movie ever, I tried hard to hold back tears multiple times."
"666",5,"  I cried through this entire movie all 3 times I've seen it. I can't believe this movie really exists and that it's as good as it is."
"667",4.5,"  It is a Pixar movie and you can see it. Feelings and real contents included."
"668",1,"  terrible garbage that no one should have to see!"
"669",0.5,"  Creo que perdieron la oportunidad de mostrar al mundo una de las tradiciones mas bonitas de MÈxico, llev√°ndolo a algo clasista y rid√≠culo."
"670",3.5,"  Adequate plot But saved by GREAT MUSIC!"
"671",5,"  Pixar has done it again. Coco is a triumph of song and family spirit. I was not expecting to like this and yet it has ended up being one of the best films of the year."
"672",4.5,"  So I saw Pixar's new movie Coco today, and man, they can still hit home runs when they put their minds to it. This is a really beautiful animated world based on Dia de Los Muertos traditions: just looking at the backgrounds and visual details was wonderful. The story's built off those traditions really well too, focusing on the importance of remembering loved ones, and it's genuinely really affecting and sweet (with some okay twists). The music's the real star though of the show though, it's excellent. The score is at turns lively, sorrowful, longing, and everything in between. The performed songs proper are even better though, with serious personality and again animated fantastically. So yeah, another big score for Pixar. Just a heads up though, a literal 21 minute Frozen Christmas special originally intended for ABC Family plays before the film in theaters; with previews, that means the movie proper doesn't start until FORTY MINUTES after the official showtime. Confused a lot of moms and kids in the theater."
"673",5,"  Excellent movie, Emotional, Family, Holiday/Festival, Happiness, Sadness, Cultural respectful, Warm-up, Heart warming, Imaginational, Fantasy, Impressed, Hopeful, Respectful, Musician Traditional, Curiosity, Childhood moment, ECT.This movie is so wonderful and I'm very like it and also this movie is so good that I can't describe with any words. If you haven't watched yet go immediately watch the movie CoCo This movie is referring cultural corner traditional of family moment.I'm highly recommended to watch it.Don't miss the magical moment of Coco is a great movie !!!!!!"
"674",4.5,"  Beautifully done. Catchy songs, lovable characters, and interesting storyline - though I did guess the ""twist"" early on, I don't feel it was overly telegraphed. The character design is spot on, you can see actual real types of face shapes in the designs instead of just the classic CG ovals and circles approach to designing faces - which was a breath of fresh air in the current wave of generic CG character designs."
"675",5,"  While a lot of animated movies attempt to play on emotions, there are barely any that leave a memorable mark.Coco has perfectly timed humour that appeals to all age groups, the story is well written and the twists, somewhere in the middle of unpredictable and predicatable enough to keep the audience interested in the movie for its events as well.The film is hugely appealing when it comes to looks as it has many moments that you gawking at the screen.All in all it is a great movie with great music that deserves its 5 stars."
"676",5,"  Very few films can capture the essence of the Dia de Muertos tradition as Coco didHard to keep the emotions in check"
"677",5,"  Vivid musical rendition of family relationships in all their broken complexity... and firm beauty."
"678",4.5,"  surprisingly amazing. almost perfect had i not seen the plot twist coming."
"679",5,"  Fantastic tribute to Mexican art and culture but easy to appreciate by those not in the know. A great family story and finally something more nuanced than a ""always follow your dream and everything will be fine story"" that is so many children's movies."
"680",4.5,"  Love how the Hispanic culture was represented. Also loved the main character, this movie was enjoyed by ages 5-65 in my family!!"
"681",5,"  This movie was amazing! Probably one of the best story lines from a kids movie I have seen since I was a kid. Very heartfelt. I was boohooing at the end of the movie."
"682",3,"  Would have gotten more stars if it had more songs."
"683",4.5,"  4.5 Glorious visuals and touching story."
"684",5,"  One Word AMAZING !!!"
"685",5,"  Best movie to watch for Thanks giving with family ! Lovely Movie !"
"686",4.5,"  Watched the movie and liked it a lot! Defitlenly one of Pixars best in a while!!"
"687",4.5,"  **Spoiler warning: contains hints at plot structure and character motivation**Coco is a loving tribute to Mexican culture and Dia De Los Muertos, with phenomenal voice acting (newcomer Anthony Gonzales is phenomenal as Miguel), a strikingly beautiful and imaginative animated world, and memorable music. Coco takes on the challenging task of combining some of Pixar's most successful themes: the unbreakable bond of family (Incredibles), pursuing one's passion (Ratatouille), the folly of the one-minded leader/mentor (through mid-movie villain reveals in Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Up, WALL-E, Monster's Inc... wow, they really like that one), and coming to terms with loss and memory (Up); Director Lee Unkrich weaves these topics expertly together around the the new theme of the power of music to build Coco a special place in the Pixar cannon. Coco also lives up to Pixar's reputation for tugging on heartstrings, developing relationships and ideas throughout the movie to an impacting and universally relatable payoff that gives meaning to the film's title. The premise of the child's dream restrained by disapproving family is well trodden, the villain reveal is a bit contrived (first revealed then unraveled twice by a metaphorical football spiking on national TV), and the ending following the emotional climax quickly glosses over some of the secondary conflicts for the feel good ending (like Inside Out); however, these small nitpicks are easy to look past for the music, the visuals, the message and the overall warmth of Coco. Most of all, I love that this movie will inspire a generation with the love of music, much like Ratatouille sparked my love of cooking and critique; we can't all be mariachi, but the world could always do with a few more songs."
"688",5,"  Fantastic movie. Easy and touch"
"689",5,"  Absolute joy for children and adults of any cultures.Having not seen any Pixar movies since Brave came out, I wasn't sure where to set my expectations for this movie, so I was very surprised at how much I loved it.One of my main concerns going into it was that I would either find the movie unrelatable or that it would serve the foreign culture in a social justice warrior manner. I was wrong. Very wrong. The movie is a natural insight into the Mexican culture (specifically the Day of the Dead) that is both engaging, interesting and inclusive. It doesn't feel like it's just Hollywood pandering to an audience, it doesn't abuse stereotypes of what the executives think people might like or want to see and most importantly they didn't whitewash the cast.The premise alone is extremely unique and engaging, throughout the whole movie it kept me guessing what would happen next. It's fast-paced, colourful, the characters are very well thought through. I was most amazed at the quality of the animation, it's absolutely mind-boggling, every little tiny detail that you would never even notice is there. It all really feels like a work of art that celebrates the Mexican culture. I also really enjoyed the fact that it had a fresh story structure where the world isn't ending and the hero doesn't have to defeat the ultimate evil but rather focuses on human issues and values.In fact, it's one of those rare movies that had me bawling my eyes out at the theatre.Anyways, I wanted to keep this review short and not go into deep details because it's worth experiencing.Coco is fun, emotional and fresh! If you like quality animation and feel good stories, you must go see it!P/SThere are even some fun easter eggs that you might miss in a blink of an eye."
"690",5,"  Coco was visually impressive animated film The film explores family relationships and a topic often avoided death. Well worth seeing Younger children may find some parts disturbing, Overall very enjoyable"
"691",5,"  Great flick! Just when you might think-- how can Pixar get any better? Imaginative, inclusive, amazing and wonderful---just plain one of their best --just be prepared to bring a few tissues for the tears..l"
"692",5,"  It is really hard to make me cry. This movie made me cry so hard. Straight 5 stars"
"693",5,"  THIS IS THE MUST SEE MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"
"694",4.5,"  For the style that this movie attempts, it succeeds wildly. The emotional tension that is created is terrific and the visual aspect is spot on as well. The story is put together in a superb, yet simple way, and Ernesto De La Cruz is a wonderful example of a reverse Macbeth."
"695",4.5,"  Your typical Pixar quality, which is to say: gorgeous animation, fantastic voice acting, and cliched scenes of emotion that will nonetheless have you reaching for tissues."
"696",5,"  Best movies seen it three times already"
"697",5,"  One of the best pictures I have seen in years. I never cried so much in a movie that touched me so deeply. A beautiful enduring movie and message about the importance of family."
"698",4,"  Excellent movie. One of Pixar's best"
"699",5,"  Best family movie I've ever watched!"
"700",4,"  It was really nice to all the kids in the theater that found themselves and their culture represented in a major Pixar film. The designs for the Land of the Dead were also extremely intricate and beautiful"
"701",5,"  It's a funny thing that a animation can make us cry like a baby."
"702",5,"  °Incre√≠ble como siempre Pixar!, representaste esta tradici√≥n de una maravillosa manera. Alegr√≠a, risas y lagrimas me dio esta pel√≠cula."
"703",4,"  Gorgeous movie,I have exceptional bias due to family circumstances mirroring this movie,Only disappointment is a very by the numbers 3rd act that does not take advantage of the imagination and vibrancy of the movies setting."
"704",4.5,"  It was really nice to see all the kids in the movie theater who found themselves and their culture represented in the film. The designs for the Land of the Dead were intricate and beautiful."
"705",3.5,"  As visually striking and fun as this movie was to watch, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wasn't able to enjoy this film as much as I was anticipating. Despite the amazing effort put into the animation, backgrounds, and the designs, the story, while still being cute enough and intriguing enough to keep me watching, fell a little bit flat for me, even despite me not guessing the twist. By child movie standards, this is a great film, although this is a Pixar film, and something about this movie didn't give me close to the same feeling that I experienced when watching Up, Monsters Inc, or a few of the other classic Pixar films that they've put out in the past. Not to say that this wasn't a enjoyable experience whatsoever- I am glad that I spent money to go see this in theaters. One of the more original Pixar movies to come out in a while- especially since The Good Dinosaur was so boring and predictable, and Pixar seems to be leaning pretty heavily on cash grab sequels to old successful films. There was clearly a lot of effort put into this film, it just didn't give me the sentimental, bittersweet feeling that I'm usually left sitting with after a Pixar movie."
"706",5,"  I've watched it 3 times in theatres. It's a must-see!!!"
"707",5,"  Best Pixar movie in recent years. Easily the greatest story of copyright theft in the history of movies."
"708",5,"  Absolutely stunning. I cried multiple times throughout the movie because of how connected I felt to the characters. There's an animated movie about my culture and it was beautiful."
"709",5,"  LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! I was not expecting the detailed and gorgeous detail in the artistry. The storyline was not what I expected either. I was wonderfully surprised on all accounts. I will be purchasing this movie!"
"710",5,"  I'm not crying. You're crying.Another terrific Pixar film that really draws out emotion and thoughtfulness. ¬°Bien hecho, Pixar!"
"711",5,"  Coco is a beautiful movie that makes you get some tears"
"712",4,"  I really enjoyed this movie a lot. The plot as terrific and I just wanted to keep dancing to the songs. The meaning of family was very good too as you thought it would go one way but then went another. It was a feel good movie at a time when the holidays are here and you want to feel good."
"713",4,"  Did not want to see this movie. I left with a happy heart. Great movie!"
"714",4,"  Its a really good movie with fresh content."
"715",5,"  Coco just officially became my favorite Pixar movie of all time! I loved the music, the colorful visuals, the mexican folklore. It's impossible to watch this movie without dropping at least one tear."
"716",5,"  This movie was lit and good it had a good ending"
"717",5,"  simply a beautiful story.!!!!!"
"718",5,"  Admittedly went in with low expectations, but should have trusted that Pixar would do the job and they flat out blew me out of the theater. Spectacular!"
"719",4.5,"  An animated film vibrant with life as it explores the connections we share with our long deceased ancestors and how that connection can dictate our future."
"720",3.5,"  I liked it but I was expecting a bit more. It is a predictable and manipulative movie, although still it manages to be a good movie."
"721",5,"  ""Coco"" is a emotional rollercoaster, you will laugh and you will cry. The movie brings a creative take on ""D√≠a de los muertos"" that will keep adults and jids interested on the story that this new Disney Pixar movie tells."
"722",5,"  When Miguel, a 12 year old Spanish boy wants to follow his hearts' dream of becoming a musician, things turn for the worst as he finds himself trapped between his family with an apathy towards music and egocentric, sleazy characters in the afterlife. On a quest to find his Grandfather he discovers a world never imagined.What a fantastic film, rich of intrigues, emotion and mesmerizing scenes.The warmth and Spanish undertone of the film, evoke your own family bonds, while fond memories and love for one's Grandmother stirs your heart.I lost myself in the movie to such an extent that I forgot I was watching an animated production.Coco is not a musical, but there is a hint of music in the film, which builds on top of the superb storyline. The screenwriter manages to create a suspense in which one can't wait for Miguel to play his next riff on his strum.The film is heartwarming. It manages to show us a different side to the afterlife, a side which we never imagined, where the dead interacts with the living and skeletons are beautiful, emotional and lovable characters.Miguel strikes a friendship with a trickster named Hector and together they discover the story about Miguel's family, which eventually leads to making his dream become reality.The animated 3D adventure encourages oneself to follow your dreams at all cost, but most importantly to put your loved ones first.The movie has been produced by Disney and taken Gross Income of $457,925,760 from it's opening on the 22nd of November until 22nd of December 2017.Coco is a wonderful film for the whole family and a must see for everyone who loves music, beautiful scenes and awesome characters!"
"723",5,"  A good story about family,memory and death."
"724",5,"  Excelente pel√≠cula, que refleja la riqueza de la cultura mexicana."
"725",4,"  Great story, although the plot was a tad too simple. Great music and animation!"
"726",5,"  Spectacular animation...with wonderful music and a good message. A complete delight"
"727",5,"  Great film/story for kids and adults"
"728",4,"  I'm in love with the CoCo!"
"729",5,"  Amazing movie! Great for the kids and the entire family!"
"730",5,"  Best Pixar film since UP! I was totally expecting a remake of the book of life, but it was not. Great twists that are hinted in the film from like the first scene, and the villain is a shock. #1 animated film of the year! I can guarantee it will get an oscar. However, it is a good thing Disney removed the short. I watched it, and it is bad enough to have a 20 minute short, and worse when the short IS BAD."
"731",4,"  Pixar, for the most part, has a reputation for producing some of the most high-quality and memorable Disney films of all time. They've put out classics like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Monsters Inc., and they rarely miss the mark when it comes to their feature films (excluding Cars 2 and Cars 3). Coco is the latest attempt from Pixar at creating another animated classic, and while it may not quite reach the level of many of its predecessors, it provides a fun and colorful family-friendly experience.The first good thing I can talk about regarding Coco is its animation. Pixar has always demonstrated a profound understanding of animation and they have always utilized the most modern computer technology to make their films look beautiful. Coco is no exception to this trend. In fact, this is one of the most beautifully animated films I have ever seen. The film is primarily set in two worlds: the real-world setting of Mexico and the fictional setting of the Land of the Dead. Both of these locations are equally vibrant in their portrayal, with the former utilizing lots of warm colors and the latter featuring a plethora of bright neon colors and a variety of blues and purples. It is a visual treat that entertains even during the film's slower moments. There are many shots that I can vividly remember due to their spectacular detail and their incredibly varied color palette, so I applaud the animators for their work on the film.Coco's astounding animation is accompanied by a heartwarming story about heavy themes like death, the meaning of family, and the effects of fame and glory. It tells the story of Miguel, a young boy living in Mexico who is a member of a family of shoemakers. Miguel loves to play the guitar and is obsessed with his idol: the great Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician and movie star. However, due to events that transpired in his family's past, music is banned in the household, which forces Miguel to keep his passion a secret. Once his family discovers this, he runs away and accidentally transports himself to the Land of the Dead during the annual Day of the Dead (D√≠a de Muertos) celebration, where he meets his deceased family members and embarks on an adventure in the colorful world. The story is entertaining and the themes it explores are fresh and interesting, especially for a Pixar film. However, this brings me to my one criticism of the film: the plot and many of its elements feel very derivative. Its basic structure - the protagonist must achieve a simple goal, but that goal is blocked by unforeseen obstacles and circumstances that lead the protagonist to meet a variety of supporting characters that can help him - gives off a very ""been there done that"" feel. Still, the climax and emotional conclusion allow Coco to transcend its many clich√©s, making it a satisfying film in the end.With Coco, Pixar reminds us that it can still make the best animated films in the industry. With Incredibles 2 on the horizon, this is especially reassuring, because I will be VERY upset if that film is a misfire. Coco is a fun, colorful, well-assembled film that is able to delight and spark an emotional response, even if it is not entirely original. With entertaining characters and themes that can resonate with all audiences, it makes for a great family film that is a must-see this holiday season. Coco gets 4 out of 5 stars."
"732",5,"  My favourite Pixar/Disney movie of all time. I'll always remember this movie as the last movie I watched with my aunt before she passed away"
"733",5,"  Can easily say that this was the best visual animation that i have ever seen. The entire team at Pixar have really outdone themselves on this one. Coco is an instant classic that people of any age can enjoy."
"734",5,"  This is such a special movie. Colorful, meaningful, beautiful story and visuals demonstrate once again why Pixar is the best of the best."
"735",5,"  Once again, Pixar has proven that they truly care about telling a genuinely heartfelt and relatable story. The animation is gorgeous, the music is fun, the characters are well-defined and the humor is great. Most of all, though, the story is beautiful with a wonderful message on the importance of family and supporting each other. I've seen it twice and would love to watch it again. It's a terrific film for everyone!"
"736",5,"  What a gorgeous, soulful, and utterly charming movie! My heart is full."
"737",3.5,"  Pixar hits it out of the park once again with Coco, an animated movie about a boy reconnecting with deceased members of his family, while trying to assert his desire to become a musician to his living relatives. The famous ""Day of the Dead"" festival takes center stage as does the role of music in Mexican culture. It bears some similarities to Guillermo del Toro's The Book of Life, though Coco is a bit more accessible, as you would imagine. The inventiveness of the City of the Dead and its culture is inspired and colorful. Notable voice performances come courtesy of Anthony Gonzalez and veteran actor Gael GarcÌa Bernal (Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n, The Motorcycle Diaries, and Babel). Michael Giacchino gives a great and memorable score and Pixar heavy Lee Unkrich keeps the plot driving with the right combination of melancholy seriousness and humor you come to expect. Coco may not compare to the studio's more eternal favorites, but it more than rises to the challenge."
"738",5,"  Coco: Deeply affecting the values on life, death, culture and family is brought together by Disney's magical time-tested gift for absorbing and magical filmcrafting. With its impressive visuals, characters and filmaking Coco is one of the best Disney films ever."
"739",4.5,"  animation does not get better than is one, saw it both in English and spanish"
"740",4,"  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!I believe that this film should be rated four stars. The movie itself was fantastic. The animation and the cast were great. It's just that the film was a little too dark for most little kids, with Ernesto de la Cruz poisoning someone and everything. Other than that, great job, Pixar! Did anyone else spot all the easter eggs in the film, like the Pizza Planet truck, or the Luxo ball, or A113?"
"741",5,"  ravishingly beautiful w a great story - highly recommend"
"742",5,"  Fantastic movie in every aspect."
"743",3,"  Coco is a beautiful film and easily the most colorful film Pixar has ever done. When it comes to a Pixar film I tend to judge it on a different scale then a typical 3D Animated film, like a Hotel Transylvania, because they have created movies that have transcended age and genre. Coco is a mid-level Pixar film, not quite up to the level of Inside-Out or Finding Nemo but definitely above Cars 2, Brave & Good Dinosaur. The film deals with the dangers of following your dreams blindly and how easily we can pass down hatred through generations of family. The film misses being classic in the supporting characters didn't make the same impression like a Bing Bong or even a Hank.See it or Skip ItThis film is so beautiful that it's worth seeing it in theaters based on that alone."
"744",5,"  Interesting character and exciting story. One of best Pixar flims."
"745",3,"  Coco fulfills the Disney lover's needs, however, falls short of competing with the classics. The visual intricacy matched with the skeletal theme provides an interesting viewing exsperince yet lacks in memorable or impactful musical numbers which has religiously been Disney's bread and butter. The story and morals of the film are clear and easily enjoyed by the whole family while also diving into a culture rich theme, but ultimately this Disney film fills the roster more then the memory book. *** I'm a pretty big Disney fan, but this was the first Disney movie I noticed myself drifting off to. Outside of it's theme Coco just seemed to lack the heartwarming magic of so many beloved classics and characters. Disney has always featured young defiant protagonists, but Miguel seemed uninteresting and forgettable."
"746",5,"  Just an amazingly beautiful work from start to finish. There is not a quibble to be found unless it's the amazing amount of stimulation but one can focus on so many things both visually and cognitively it really doesn't matter... The story and character development is stellar. This is an INSTANT CLASSIC A MUST see!"
"747",4,"  Coco is such a smart animated film which is very detailed and emotional that while it brings up certain topics again from other films such as the Day of the Dead it can be its own classic in one way or another.Grade: A"
"748",5,"  A great movie for the family and about family, especially for those that know what Day of the Dead is about. I honestly cannot say anything negative about this film. It's heartfelt, has a great plot, and even a plot twist. I highly recommend watching this film to any and all audiences."
"749",5,"  Unpredictable storyline twists even for experienced movie-goers; this movie ties together lessons learned from music, life, and death to offer fresh new perspective on legacy + remembrance."
"750",4.5,"  Just saw what could possibly be the best animated movie of 2017, Coco. The animation was visually stunning, the music was glorious, and the twist in the climax was shocking and really blew my mind! Also, the movie was really heartfelt and emotional. In fact: it was so emotional that my older sister actually went in tears in the last 20 minutes. Overall, even though there were some things in the movie that were a little bit too similar to Book of Life, it was still amazing! 9.5/10."
"751",5,"  Refreshingly new faces for Disney and Pixar and the soundtrack is excellent both in song quality and the appropriate use in the film."
"752",5,"  Pixar has done it again with a wonderfully creative concept, stunning visuals, sweet story, and plot that really keeps you guessing."
"753",5,"  Great movie for sure. Very few movies that can really touch like this one did when it comes to family, legacy, comedy, and memories. Had most of my family in tears when we watched it. Beautiful scenery was captivating and Pixar did their homework when it comes to treating the Mexican culture with respect."
"754",4,"  Much better than I was expecting."
"755",5,"  Excellent, An almost perfect movie."
"756",5,"  One of the best movies I and my family have seen in quite a while. I did not think I would like it that much as at 58 years old I thought what could an animated movie do that has not been done but I was wrong."
"757",4.5,"  I love everything about this movie."
"758",4,"  Wonderful from start to finish; the art work and music was enchanting. Worried that it would not hold the younger kids I took to it like a story with more action or familiarity but they were enthralled. This is everything that an animated movie should be. The art work was fresh and invoked so much emotion and gave a real visceral feel to the whole experience. The music flowed and felt so right in each and every moment of the movie. The voice work was exceptional, especially Gael Garcia Bernal and Alanna Ubach, but there really was no weak link in the voice cast. This is one that can be enjoyed more each time you see it; and each time you will find something new. Loved It."
"759",4.5,"  This movie was beautifully made and enjoyable for the whole family. You can tell they tried to give you an authentic feel of Mexico while watching it. The animation has beautiful visuals that are colorful and mesmerizing. The detail is mind-blowing, especially when you find out there are about 7 million lights they added to the Land of the Dead. The only issue I had with this movie was a 21 minute Frozen short (Olaf's Frozen Adventure) you needed to watch before getting to see Coco. That short (not sure how you can call 21 minutes of torture short) was just painful to watch, but Disney has since fixed that and removed the Frozen short."
"760",3,"  With a silly slapstick humor and pedestrian jokes that scream Disney much more than Pixar, Coco may look stunning but is a disappointment, resorting to too many clichÈs and predictable twists that you can see from miles away while never managing to even justify its title."
"761",4,"  Extremadamente imaginativa y emotiva."
"762",3.5,"  Asa european I have not much ""Understanding"" for Latin-american traditions and did not get the appeal for european audiences.The first third of the movie was kinda head scratching.The second third I was getting use to ""coco""In the last third I was fully on board.I liked it as a ""light themed movie about life/death/family/heritage/passion!Thanks Pixar!"
"763",1,"  I think the animation is similar to The Book of Life. Which was a wonderful movie."
"764",4.5,"  I can not describe this movie with words, I can say only it is amazing. disney always have wonderful ideas and their movies are very emotional. I cried on the last scene of the movie."
"765",5,"  Fun enjoyable movie for all!!"
"766",4.5,"  Coco, BEST ANIMATED MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! Where to even begin with this one! The visuals, absolutely stunning, the story is just great. It reminds me so much of Ratatouille's story in many ways. Also, Coco is entertaining from start to finish. It's funny, it's engaging, it's full of meat on it's bones, and most importantly, it's super touching. Now, going in, I heard people say that it is at least guaranteed to make you cry, and you know what, they were absolutely right. Judging by how one, it's Pixar, and two, it was directed by Lee Unkrich, the same guy who directed Toy Story 3, it makes sense. But DAMN, was I expecting it to be as sad as something like Up or Inside Out? Hell no, and that was the biggest takeaway for me. Other Pixar movies like Wall-E, Up, Toy Story 3, and Inside Out may have had me tear up, but Coco went above and beyond with that. It had me not only tear up, but kind of cry even, and that says something. Like with other Pixar movies, you really care and connect with the characters, which adds to how touching and thought provoking these movies are. Coco is indeed one of those movies. It is definitely part of my top ten Pixar movies, and is something nobody should miss out on. If you think it's a ripoff of The Book of Life, RECONSIDER! It may look like it, but trust me, when you watch it, it's nothing like The Book of Life. I personally like Coco more than The Book of Life, and by far too. The Book of Life was great and all, but nothing compared to Coco. This movie truly is a love letter to Mexico, and does everything The Book of Life did, but on a larger scale. 9.5 out of 10, it is fantastic, and if you thought Cars 3 left a sour taste in your mouth like me, do not worry because Pixar completely made up for It with Coco. It is a MUST SEE!!"
"767",4,"  Well done. Fun story."
"768",5,"  This is not only the best film of the year, but one of the BEST ANIMATED FILMS OF THE YEAR! The plot is emotional & amazing, the animation is stunning & the characters are all memorable! IT'S A PIXAR MASTERPIECE! GO SEE IT! <3 YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
"769",4,"  Another great piece by Pixar. The animation in unbelievable. A visual delight. The story held my interest."
"770",4.5,"  Great Movie. loved it!"
"771",5,"  Coco is a fun and exiting movie with great surprises ????"
"772",4.5,"  Coco is a outstanding, unique, family-friendly movie that is up there with Pixar's giants. Its stunning visuals and amazing colors makes it a heart-warming, welcoming movie. It makes you want to actually dive into the movie itself."
"773",5,"  I loved this movie so much. It was perfect in every way. I cried my head off. See it with your whole family, then go back and see it again. Bravo!"
"774",5,"  Fantastic movie! with a great premise and a special look into a fascinating tradition."
"775",5,"  What a beautiful emotional film! OMG!! Disney and Pixar always have the best stories that make us feel so vulnerable and sentimental. This one tells the story about the little aspiring musician Miguel, who confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer. The level of research of the writers of the script is gigantic, they actually caught Mexico's essence. The animation is wonderful, it is someting I had never seen before and the whole movie is feast to the eyes. This is going to be the WINNER of all Best Animated Film Awards. Good Luck at the Awards Season! Amazing music and soundtrack!"
"776",5,"  A deeply emotive and great tribute to the Mexican culture and people who are part of the popular culture. Highly reccomended."
"777",4,"  I really liked this one! A nice edition to the Pixar collection. Very heartfelt movie that shows the importance of family. It was nice to learn about the Mexican folklore in the movie and it was explained really well so that an outsider would understand what was going on with the Day of the Dead holiday. Loved the colors in this film they were beautiful! Definitely a nice add to the Pixar film collection."
"778",5,"  One of the best Pixar movies..."
"779",5,"  Pixar does it again. Ohh the feels!"
"780",2.5,"  Coco was a big disappointment for me. Yeah, it looks pretty, there's some heart, and admittedly the ending was brilliant, but in between those are very bland jokes that I never found funny, modern Disney cliches like the plot twist villain, and a dog named Dante who's probably one of the most annoying animal side characters I've ever seen. Very mixed feelings for me.5/10."
"781",5,"  Best movie I've seen so far completely loved it. Visually stunning. Great story."
"782",5,"  An emotional, beautiful film, that successfully incorporates much of the traditions and urban legends involved in the Dia de Los Muertos holiday. Well done."
"783",5,"  My favorite movie currently in theaters. Coco made me cry. At least 3 times. Every moment was emotional and the ending built so well and the core message, the artistry, and the small details really made the movie what it was."
"784",5,"  Best Pixar movie in a very, very long time."
"785",5,"  What a wonderful tribute to Mexican culture. This movie had me on an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was laughing uncontrollably and the next I was on the verge of tears. This is now my second all time favorite Pixar movie behind Toy Story and just ahead of Inside Out."
"786",5,"  Dramatic funny greatest movie ever!~√∞~√∞~√∞~√∞~√∞~√∞¬§-√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~,√∞~√∞~√∞~?√∞~,√∞~√∞~√∞~...√∞~√∞~√∞~√∞~"
"787",4,"  Marvelously visual and full of flavor, Coco glows. An introspective adventure, complete with magic, curious creatures, and the music of living."
"788",5,"  So unbelievably beautiful, in all definitions of that word."
"789",5,"  So good had me sobbing I don't think I've seen a better movie yet"
"790",5,"  I had the pleasure of watching the film in both English and Spanish.Regardless of language, the film was a beautiful portrayal of Mexican culture of family, comedy and Dia de los Muertos."
"791",4.5,"  Pixar sigue demostrando que es una de las grandes potencias de la animaci√≥n con Coco, y esta vez da un paso m√°s all√° (nunca mejor dicho) al atreverse a explorar un contexto completamente diferente. Una historia emotiva, un protagonista carismatico y especialmente un estudio bien documentado de las tradiciones culturales mexicanas hacen de esta pel√≠cula una joya verdaderamente especial dentro de su pante√≥n."
"792",4,"  Great story and human"
"793",5,"  This heartwarming tale has exquisite animation, beautiful characters and something to appeal to everyone."
"794",5,"  More Than Just a Passion At present, the Mexican population is one of the most judged by the Americans. There are inhumane plans to prevent their passage in the territory of the United States as it is to build a famous border wall and among many other things. Therefore, having a large American company import a film of protagonists and Mexican history can have a great impact on American society. These companies are Disney and Pixar that have marked the lives of many children and young people for several years. Accompanying this, the purpose of children's films, in addition to entertaining children, is to promote values and carry a deep and real message that maybe the child does not understand at the moment but that parent or manager who accompanies him to watch the movies understands it and in some way, it moves him. Therefore, most of the time the movies educates both; the infant and adult. Mentioning that, I can say I liked the film because, besides being created by an American company that accepts these people, the American population has the opportunity to learn more about the Mexican culture an realize that we all go through similar adversities... we are all humans.The titled movie ""Coco"" reports the story of a Mexican child who wanted to be a musician, but because of family tradition it was prohibited to be a musician. Therefore, the child decides to play his guitar in a talent contest undercover of its relatives to demonstrate to the world the great musician he was. For his luck, the day of the contest was the same day of the Day of the Dead and he had to spend the whole day along with his family to celebrate it. While they all were in the cemetery remembering their family, the child decides to escape to find an instrument to play in the contest so he decides to steal a guitar from one of the biggest musicians and most successful one of the Mexican history who had already died. At the moment of stealing it from him, he appears in the world of the dead persons and he can only escape with the blessing of a relative and accepting the requisites that the relative proposes to him. After accepting, it begins the passage of the boy to look for a relative who offers him its blessing along with the permission of being able to become a musician.The story of the same one is a quite structured one although it is not one that is organized in a chronological order. It starts by reporting the past of the family and why they decide to hate any one that was a musician. It continues with the present of the child and its passage of going so far as to turn in musician and inside its passage there appear many flashbacks that fit with the reasons of hate towards the musicians from his family. The characters did not turn aside of its role and with this I refer to that it is possible to identify that it is a person of Mexican culture. For example, there are movies that the original role of the protagonist it supposes to be Latin, Korean, Japanese, European, etc. ... depending on the story, and the producers usually choose persons who do not qualify with the role of the protagonist and somehow part of the plot gets lost because it does not fit with the person. The viewer already has an idea of how it is supposed to be the protagonist and ends up being completely different from the one whom you were imagining to be the ideal. But in this case the protagonist sticks to its role.The composition of the music for the movie was an exquisite one that made you want to sing mariachi music until you lost your voice. With the music the viewer could feel so many emotions by the passion the protagonist was dedicating to each song. Although it is a cartoon movie, the viewer feels, cries, laughs and gets angry because behind every character there is a real story. Also, all the songs that were listened in the movie were mariachi songs, typical genre of Mexico, and each one was keeping a message that was going as regards to the story of the movie, from the freedom up to the memory.On the other hand, the scenery was fascinating because you could appreciate every detail for more minimal that it was. For example, the scenery of the World of the Dead persons was one that was consisting of 20 scenes that were creating only one image making the background one full of specific details to achieve a general image. The animation and texture of the background was excellent, whenever a character was moving from one place to another it was as if it really was leaving a mark in the space that he was treading. For example, the details in the character, both the hair and the clothes, seemed to be real.It is a movie that I fully recommend because it is full of surprises. When you were thinking that it already had the concluded movie, it surprised you with other things different from those that you had already raised. For this reason, the movie does not bore the viewer because every time something happened you will want to know what would actually happen or what that situation will become. I recommend, if you understand the Spanish language, to see it in Spanish because it makes you feel familiarly with the Mexicans. Since it is known, the Spanish language is the one that prevails in Mexico and to listen to mariachi music in English, for me, it would be quite strange and this Mexican flavor would get lost. Nevertheless, if you do not understand Spanish I suppose that the message will be delivered no matter what. Also, I recommend you to be prepared with towels to see the movie because you will cry from beginning to end."
"795",5,"  One of the best things Pixar's has ever made. It's funny, emotional and specially: It has a very good history. 10/10"
"796",3,"  Good but not that good."
"797",4.5,"  Its has been a very long time since I was that emotional after watching an animation. Coco really got me. Funny, touching with profound messages bout family and chasing your dreams. Although I kinda guess that plot twist but still good. The music is great but to me, the main song isnt quite excellent, thats why i gave it 4.5/5."
"798",5,"  The movie was so beautiful with the culture and the music and it made me want to dance in some scenes. The holiday is now being shown to others and showing them what it is about. It was educational and fun at once. Now I want to make some sugar skulls and hug my family tight. The grandmother was so.... Real. I wanted to cry just seeing her. GO HUG YOU ABUEILIT AS PEOPLE! HUG THEM AND KISS THEM"
"799",4.5,"  Secret Superstar - Sing - Inside Out - Up - Blood In Blood Out - Moana"
"800",5,"  I was totally blown away by this movie! It's inspiring, emotional, stunning and filled with wonderful music. A very strong comeback for Pixar! Gracias!"
"801",5,"  Best Disney/Pixar movie since Toy Story 3"
"802",5,"  Coco is one of the best Pixar movies ever.Maybe it's the fact that I'm Mexican, but this movie really brought me childhood memories in la plaza de los mariachis, the food and DÌa de los Muertos. Some of you may not understand the elements, but I was fascinated by the details and how good the music was. Pixar nailed it!"
"803",5,"  Beautifully made. It made me cry. It's very emotionally captivating."
"804",5,"  In my opinion, this is one of the best Pixar movies. I can't put this in my Top 5 because the Toy Story movies, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., The Incredibles, Inside Out, and Up will have a special place in my heart. However, Coco was an emotional and beautiful movie that teaches the importance of being yourself, but also to never forget about your family. The humor, music (it didn't stick with me as much as other Disney/Pixar scores, but it was still good), voice performances, originality, heart, and story made Coco one of my favorite animated movies ever."
"805",4,"  Pixar does is again. One of the best Pixar movies I've seen. Kudos."
"806",4.5,"  A great film with a heart felt storyline. Fantastic ending."
"807",4.5,"  Stunningly beautiful animation highlights this effective Disney/Pixar family film; one of the best animated films in recent memory."
"808",4,"  Ah, Pixar... you certainly have a formula, but damned if that formula doesn't work every time. This movie is their latest installment, and it's so refreshing to see them put out a film that so fully embraces a different culture. This movie actually practices what Hollywood has been preaching for a long time, and celebrates diversity on multiple levels. The story follows a Mexican boy, Miguel, and his very Mexican family and ancestry. Every single character in the movie is a brown person (or used to be, before they got dead), and it's about damn time. That alone makes it deserving of high marks, but this is Pixar, so you know there is also going to be an engaging story (check) with a poignant lesson at the end (check), and probably some laughs and tears (check and check) along the way. The plot follows little Miguel as he yearns to be a musician despite his family's vehement opposition to anything related to music. His journey takes him over to the other side where he meets his ancestors, because reasons (the film doesn't even try to explain it). The story has its ups and downs... it doesn't always make sense and takes a while to get going, but it pays off at the end, when it becomes clear why the movie has the title it does. And the animation! It's incredibly vibrant and lavish, every scene just pops... it adds so much fun and exuberance to the ""underworld"", I wondered why Miguel was even trying to get back to the land of the living. This film is not as funny as I've grown to expect from Pixar, but on the flip side, it delivers big time on the sentiment. This movie features one of the purest and sweetest scenes that I have seen in ages, and it packs a wallop of an emotional punch. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. This isn't Pixar's finest, but a great family film with a powerful message about the importance of family and tradition."
"809",5,"  Pixar delivered big time with this beautiful movie."
"810",4.5,"  Pixar did a great job of explaining a very morbid theme of death. Not gonna lie i cried at the end. They manage to pull of an other classic"
"811",5,"  Even by Pixar standards, this film is a visual masterpiece. The soundtrack worked perfectly. There was a lot riding on the music, given how much it ties into the story, and yet, it all works well. The themes are great, the expression of Mexican culture is great, and the characters, even the minor ones, are pretty memorable. A great film for any audience."
"812",5,"  The most genuine representation of Mexican culture with a great story and fitting music to captivate anyone's heart. A truly universal experience."
"813",5,"  RecuÈrdame!Extra√±o a mi familia debido a esta pel√≠cula. ?? Especialmente mi mam√° y mi abuela.I never cried hard in cinema for an animated film. You SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS ANIMATION!"
"814",5,"  This is such a beautiful movie. I highly recommend it to any college student away from home. It brought so many tears to my eyes during the movie and after. It reminds you to cherish the time you have with your family and friends while you're still together and to remember the beautiful memories of your past if not with those you love at the moment. There are countless scenes where I could barely handle all the beauty and details. And the music is so rich and brings in a lot of Mexican culture. Overall, it's a beautiful movie with amazing graphics, music, and even more amazing storyline. Please watch with friends that can cry with you. it makes it that much better. i'm listening to the soundstrack right now, and it's about to bring me to tears again."
"815",4,"  The most original Pixar film to come along in awhile. If Jorge Gutierrez is okay with it, so am I."
"816",5,"  I've never remotely teared up in a Pixar movie. This had me ballin!"
"817",5,"  Really...nothing to complain about. This was a beautiful movie."
"818",5,"  Very funny and moving, but so sad and (more so at the beginning) mysterious. I LOVE IT!!!!!"
"819",5,"  One of Pixar's great film's of 2017 already, a very well and fun movie with once again, great animation. Pixar has done it again!"
"820",5,"  A beautiful film and well told story."
"821",5,"  This movie was just... beautiful. The mexican-styled adventure made the movie enjoyable and adorable. The movie had serious and funny moments, the creators knew when and where to put them. The story is very good and the setting is visually stunning. This is one of the best animated movies I've seen this year"
"822",5,"  When Disney/Pixar first announced Coco I was sceptical as it sounded an awful lot like The Book of Life, which is a hugely underrated animated movie everyone should watch. Pixar has a great track record, with very few missteps. I'm looking at you Cars 2 & 3! No, I won't include The Good Dinosaur because there is a good movie in there if you give it a chance. So could Coco be too much for Pixar? When it comes to respectfully handling other cultures, Hollywood is, well it's a bit shit! I had faith, however, because Pixar has a habit of meticulous research and detail, so if anyone could do right by the Mexican culture and make an engaging, smart, thoughtful, funny, heartwarming animated adventure they could. While this is not a musical, the music plays a massive role in Coco. I was mesmerized by Coco from start to finish. The visuals, the voices, the music, oh the music, and while the story hung by a thread at times it mattered not. Sure The Book of Life had a similar journey through the land of the dead, but that is where the similarities end. Why can't we have two movies based on the same aspects of Mexican culture? If this is what we get out of it, the more the merrier!The themes of love and loss, family and friendships, and what makes us who we are certainly struck a chord (pun unintended) with me. And that showed in the way my damn eyes started leaking!! Coco is a movie that made me feel full after leaving the theatre. Full of joy, love, and sweets and a large overpriced Icee beverage! It is easily the best-animated movie of the year and may even be one of Pixar's best! Yes, I said it, it is that good! I have to rethink my top 10, maybe even my top 5 Pixar flicks!"
"823",5,"  Great story-telling, wonderful animations, a nice unforeseen twist, and an emotional ending. This is Pixar at its best."
"824",5,"  If you are a person with a song in your heart this is your movie. The family and the meaning in this movie is all. I cry like a little kid and I love each second of this. With an idea in my mind, I have been blowing away when I finish the movie! This is a movie to watch at any time"
"825",2,"  Bland, trite, and overly reliant on coincidence, this story does nothing offensive, but it has nothing except for its bright aesthetic to distinguish it from any other generic 'journey of discovery' style family movie."
"826",3.5,"  fun movie for the whole family"
"827",3.5,"  Fun movie with interesting plot twists and decent didactic themes for kids. Overall, quite childish for my taste but no regrets."
"828",4.5,"  yet another family-centered masterpiece from Pixar"
"829",3.5,"  It was heartwarming and funny. The spirit guides were visually stunning. I think it's too frightening for my 4 year old."
"830",5,"  The story - the voice acting - the beauty of the entire movie. Everything was great. A must add to any animated collection!"
"831",4,"  Pixar story about a young boy who wants nothing more than to be a musician, except that his shoemaker family has forbidden music due to the boy's great great grandfather abandoning the family long ago to pursue a life as a musician (Coco is the boy's very elderly great grandmother, and daughter of the shunned musician). The film takes place during Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where families remember and celebrate their deceased relatives, and when the film's hero, Miguel, discovers his runaway relative is actually the famous star of music and film, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice by Benjamin Bratt), he sets out to seize his moment by entering a music contest, only to find himself transported to the colorful and vibrant land of the dead. There he find a world populated by skeletal deceased relatives waiting to be remembered by their families so they can return to the world of the living to once again be with their descendants and loved ones. Miguel must find a way back to the world of the living before the end of the night, but that's not as easy as he expects when he discovers his relatives in the land of the dead also continue to hold music in contempt and refuse to help unless he renounces music. But wait! Ernesto de la Cruz is a relative and a musician, but he's just as famous in death as he was in life, so for Miguel to get to de la Cruz is no easy task. Miguel is aided on his quest by H√©ctor, a down-on-his-luck character who claims to know de la Cruz, but who is beginning to fade away from this world because his family no longer remembers him. Without spoiling any plot points, it's the themes of family and being remembered by your children and descendants that tugs at the heart strings and is at the core of the film. Pixar does sentiment better than anyone (I still get weepy just thinking of Bing Bong's farewell scene from ""Inside Out""), where it's rarely maudlin or saccharine, and is typically genuine and easily identifiable. The idea of being forgotten by your family is one that will hit home for parents watching the film, and the themes around family connections will be identifiable for both kids and adults. Setting the story aside for a second, I haven't even mentioned the film's lively music (""Remember Me"" is a real ear-worm), it's clever sense of humor (Miguel's street dog friend steals most every scene he's in), and the film's eye-popping visuals. It's also very cool for a major studio film to not feature a single anglo character and to instead feature a characters outside the dominant culture of the United States. My main complaint about the film is it's over reliance on plot devices and episodic adventures that were rather forced and relied once too often on coincidence, but I'm sure this will only annoy adults and the kids won't even notice. Overall, ""Coco"" is a solid entry in the Pixar canon of films, and although it's not quite up to ""Monsters Inc."" ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"" standards of greatness, it's still far better than any of the ""Cars"" movies."
"832",5,"  This movie is astoundingly lovely. The message is simple but meaningful. I loved the plot twist as well as the magnificent elements that Pixar used to spice up the misunderstanding between characters. Though soft but absolutely unforgettable."
"833",0.5,"  Just because my Spanish teacher is retarded"
"834",5,"  Great movie. Third act packs a wallop ,"
"835",5,"  Excelent movie. I love Pixar movies!. This one was a little bit obvious but nevertheless it was great!"
"836",4,"  Had a great time with the movie! Great story. Wonderful visuals. I mean, you knew how it would turn out, but there was a nice twist in there and the movie was just a good time. Heck, I even liked the Frozen short they played before the show (which I know I'm in the minority there... lol)"
"837",5,"  Ohmigahd, the tears!"
"838",4,"  This movie is really cute. great for both kids and adults. It's magical and the animation is amazing, let alone the cinematography. the plot is predictible but hey, it's a kid's movie. The only thing that really bothered me it's that the songs were also translated. I think it would have been more enjoyable in the original spanish. But that's personal preferences."
"839",5,"  Coco was a movie I didn't really know much about when I walked in to it, but I loved more than any Pixar movie before. It was heart warming, and caused me to cry at times. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, with a good message."
"840",4,"  Great story, with some very touching moments. Felt very genuine, which is all I ask of a movie."
"841",5,"  Coco is a film that returns Pixar to the days of old and what they are capable of. It is the best explanation of the Mexican Dia de Muertos celebration. Not as a macabre festival of death but a touching celebration of remembrance. The animation palette is rich and the voice acting sublime. Especially newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel.The story is a perfect family film for both kids and adults. It teaches us the importance of family and remembering those that have left us and what they contributed to our lives. Don't be afraid to let the tears flow."
"842",5,"  Watch out parents....this one is a big-time tear-jerker. There will be lots of sniffles and held back tears at the end of the movie."
"843",5,"  Hermosa, emotiva y muy bien realizada"
"844",5,"  For me Coco is one of the best Disney Pixar movies I ever seen, it has a great story and you Couoh go and hace a good time with your family."
"845",5,"  It was the best animated movie I have ever seen and I'm very happy it honors my country's tradition and culture. The ending was simply perfect and took the time to enjoy every part of it. Every detail was amazing and new, I'm very glad I saw it."
"846",4.5,"  A solid entry into the pixar lineup. Good music, good story, great visuals. Family enjoyed it."
"847",5,"  Wonderful movie for kids and adults of all ages. Highly recommend! A++"
"848",5,"  Best Pixar's work ever."
"849",5,"  My daughter and I loved it."
"850",4,"  Puntaje Original: 7.5Otra m·gica pel√≠cula de Pixar, con entra√±ables personajes, muy colorida y musicalmente espl√©ndida. Coco cuenta con un gran mensaje que la vuelve ideal para ver en familia."
"851",4.5,"  Technically beautifully animated film. It was touching and had a wonderful story about remembering family and truth."
"852",0.5,"  Book of Life rip off"
"853",5,"  Colourful, sentimental, an unexpected pleasure! Loved it"
"854",5,"  Was a great movie had everything in it, thanks Disney"
"855",4.5,"  One of Pixar's best. Also has one of Pixar's best messages in any movie. Definitely see it."
"856",5,"  The best that Pixar has created...."
"857",4,"  A great addition to the Pixar family. Visually stunning coupled with great heart."
"858",5,"  Pixar?s best movie to date."
"859",4,"  Great production. You can see the passion through and through the entire production ranks. A couple of my favorites were in the storyline/plot, audio & visual, as well as pure creativity in execution. It would be 5 stars if I hadn't felt a sense of ""overdoing it"". There appeared to me various climatic points but they did end it off with a good bang. Left me feeling very good inside."
"860",4,"  Coco is a beautifully animated film with oodles of detail and a touching story great for families; it is very likely that it will win best-animated feature of the year. Coco is a movie about Dia de Los Muertos (The Day of the Dead) and Mexican culture, featuring a young boy, Miguel, who wants to be a musician despite his close families' contempt toward the idea. The film follows a semi-familiar path as Miguel does whatever he can to follow his dreams which end up leading him into another world, the place we go when we die. From there the movie goes beyond the simple message of following your dreams and becomes more about a wider range of themes such as life, death, family, success, and culture. Coco's story hits on many different subject matters and that is part of why it is so special; Coco is more than just pretty animation but it has something to say and show to people, it has a purpose in society. Not just that but Coco, from what I've heard, is very accurate when it comes to Mexican culture and tradition, showing that the creators behind the picture did their research and truly cared about the product they created. The voice actors did tremendous jobs with bringing their characters to life as their characters are vibrant and unique (as we've come to expect from Pixar) and the story is rich. Another thing that Coco did was be a little more mature than you would expect an animated film marketed towards children would be; there a couple of darker moments and twists that make the movie stand out from the wishy-washy animation thrown into theaters all the time. The visuals present in Coco were tremendous, you can clearly tell that the animators put all their time and effort into making the film the best version of itself. Every shot is full of detail and there is never a boring shot. From the lights to the fantastical creatures to the playing of music, everything was expertly crafted. The only downside I had with Coco was my failure to connect with the story and characters as much as others who know more about Mexican culture and tradition; this is, ?however, more of a me thing than it is a problem with the film. While I thought the film was excellently made, I couldn't connect to the characters as well as I could with those in other Pixar films such as Up and The Incredibles. While I think that Coco is easily the highest quality animated film of the year, I would be more likely to watch Lego Batman again (I probably just lost all of my credibility, didn't I?). I didn't even expect to see Coco in theaters but I did, and for those of you who don't expect to either, maybe you should reconsider (just an idea); Coco is a job well done."
"861",5,"  Even though its not a documentary, coco represents almost how Mexican culture celebrates Dia de Muertos . Well done Pixar!"
"862",5,"  Pixar does it again with Coco but the box office is more the good dinosaur."
"863",5,"  Good job Disney/Pixar. A great Holiday movie. If you can, catch a 3D showing."
"864",4,"  Very good. Charming."
"865",5,"  What a beautiful story, is one of the best animated features that I have seen in a long time."
"866",5,"  I cry 4 times with this movie is the best i see this year i really love the concept of how Pixar explain the story of a Mexican Family i really love this movie and recommend all of you too see in the Cinema is the best animation film in 2017.. 10/10"
"867",5,"  Coco is sure to win Pixar another Oscar."
"868",4.5,"  I believe in Pixar again after this film. It's beautifully written, animated, and crafted with a message that is strong and effective. It's gorgeous to look at and hearing it is just as wonderful."
"869",4.5,"  Lee Ulrich, Darla K. Anderson and Adri·n Molina did a spectacular job in portraying the Day of the Dead inside Coco, giving us a story that not only pays homage to the annual holiday, but also to Mexican customs, the importance of family and the great personalities of Mexico, such as Frida Kahlo, Pedro Infante and Jorge Negrete."
"870",4,"  Does Coco rise to the heights of Pixar's very best work? No. But it is a generous, heartfelt film, full of color and music, one that offers a timely Thanksgiving tribute to the intergenerational importance of family."
"871",5,"  I really liked it.And it turned out that Miguel's favorite singer actually poisoned the real singer Ector and stole his songs(Well at least let's just say that there were skeletons from the Land Of The Dead)."
"872",5,"  Beautiful and full of heart. I knew little of the Dia de Los Muertos holiday but this gave me not just a cultural lesson but a family oriented story. The brilliant colors dance throughout this movie. Many times I wanted the frame to stop, just so I could take in all the beautiful details in the multi-layer frame. The mix of Spanish into the English was just perfect."
"873",5,"  Coco is a very beautiful animation with a very emotional story based on the family and the loss of loved ones. Pixar continues to offer high quality animated films offering humor and tears, with surprising visual technology. If I had to say something negative, it is that the story is something predictable, however it does not prevent the film from being enjoyable and touching the most sensitive fiber of the majority."
"874",4.5,"  Great movie!!! Pixar once again delivers. My only fault, and this is more of a personal preference, is the music, not a fan of the Mariachi genre. Other than that the movie has no major flaws."
"875",5,"  Beautiful music and an important message is one of Pixar's best films"
"876",4.5,"  A fantastic movie which not only left me entertained, but also helped me learn new things about Mexican Culture. The visuals are amazing, the story was fun, and the authenticity shined through in every aspect of the movie. I saw this movie on somewhat of a whim, but I'm very glad I did. The film has a few stagnant moments, but none distract from the film's great feel and fun cast."
"877",5,"  Great music and a fun ride for all!"
"878",5,"  Best movie this year!"
"879",5,"  Perfect representation of DÌa de los Muertos."
"880",4.5,"  Best pixar movie since inside out"
"881",5,"  Even if the story is a classical Hero's journey, Pixar delivers a great take on it"
"882",4,"  This is a lovely film, wellw ritten and heartfelt with several good messages. It isn't perfect but it has perfect moments. The song ""Remember Me"" ties it all together melodically. There is humor and depth. I liked it very much."
"883",5,"  I love this movie so much it made me cry because of certain similarities to my familiy history. Yes, I guess by knowing your true family history you can even Get the facts straightened out. Kudos to the developers of this movie!"
"884",5,"  Gracias Pixar for such a lovely story. Please give us rich stories and beautiful visuals like this."
"885",5,"  I nearly cried a river. It was really a good and touching movie. I want to watch it again for another emotional yet fun ride."
"886",4.5,"  RECUERDAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"887",5,"  Not the best Pixar, but at the bottom of the best list"
"888",5,"  These mother fuckers made me cry three fucking times"
"889",5,"  An artistic movie combine with excellent music and story line. It's a must watch"
"890",3,"  It got kinda boring but was redeemed at the end. Very touching story that made you want to cry."
"891",4.5,"  what a great way to show people what day of the dead is. Great for all ages wonderful graphics and animation."
"892",5,"  I have been two times at Dia de Muertos and i can say that Coco efectively captures the true feeling of this celebration, but most of all it really grasps the beautiful relationships of family in latin america. I cried my heart out not because i was sad, but because i was filled with joy and amazement."
"893",3,"  I don't think this is a brilliant movie by any stretch of the imagination (Pixar has had better moments for sure), but it is certainly beautiful, emotional and culturally relevant, so it definitely deserves my recommendation."
"894",5,"  Hermosa. Muestra lo grande que es la cultura mexicana y nos entrega una historia sumamente emotiva."
"895",5,"  Pixar's best!!! Ending made me cry like a baby!!"
"896",5,"  Great movie! Will buy it once available. contains ethos, logos, and pathos. loved every minute of it"
"897",5,"  Pixar really knows how to tug at our heart strings... This was a beautiful movie that pays great respect to traditions."
"898",5,"  This is Pixar through and through. Bring tissues."
"899",5,"  Absolutely fantastic."
"900",5,"  One of Pixar's best films! This one took me by complete surprise, it's such an emotional story that will definitely leave you in tears by the end. It pays such a tremendous amount of respect for Mexican culture and their portrayal of Day of the Dead shows that they took the necessary research to understand the true meaning of the Mexican holiday. That Frozen ""short"" was just overly long and should not have been played after nearly 20 minutes of previews before. I like Frozen, but it's vastly overrated."
"901",5,"  Is there another star I can select. What an amazing movie. Coco frustrates me that the award shows have a best animated film category as I truly believe this movie should be considered with those nominated for best film. It's a triumph from start to finish. Our whole family loved it. The stunning visuals, the fabulous music, and most importantly, the heart. There's so much heart in this film. Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel is fantastic. There's not much more to say other than see this movie (bring Kleenex) but see this movie!"
"902",4.5,"  A new Disney Classic! It was so refreshing to experience such a heartwarming family story that was not the standard white nuclear family. I loved the beautiful imagery and rich characters. The plot was slightly predictable and the ending felt a little rushed. Great family film everyone should see."
"903",5,"  Coco is a fresh air to the animated movies of this year,with good characters,emotions,but the best of coco is the plot, no many animated movies like to interact with the dead but coco manage out to make a good plot with it,a very emotional movie for this year."
"904",4.5,"  Pixar delivers a culturally accurate and moving picture once again. It might feel a bit slow in some parts to your child. However, the kids will have fun and you will get to enjoy a genuine work of art. The themes are simple enough for kid's to learn important morals, and nuanced enough to be viscerally moving to adults. There is a movie here that everyone will love. Go watch!"
"905",5,"  Mi hizo llorar, genial"
"906",1,"  Very bad movie. Walked out at the 35 minute mark. Boring movie."
"907",4,"  A cute movie that tugs on the old heart strings. Visually BEAUTIFUL! The writing is good, not amazing but good. Dialog is where it lacks a little bit. The flagship song is sang in English during the movies entirety, which is a little disappointing. Watch or rent at least once."
"908",4.5,"  Pixar has a long history of making beautiful movies that are classics and they now have another. The visuals and colors in Coco were stunning and the music was a joy, which is to be expected in a Pixar film now. What I really enjoyed about Coco was the illustration of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) and the Mexican culture. They did a fantastic job of capturing it and explaining every ritual's purpose. The dialogue is another pleasant surprising element of this film. The dialogue, plot and narrative was rich and has a great mix of drama, humor and pulls you in for the heart felt moments. It's hard to make a movie that is educational with beautiful visuals and entertaining, but Pixar encapsulated all three with Coco."
"909",5,"  Really enjoyable movie, well done!"
"910",5,"  2nd best animated film of the year behind LEGO Batman & 2nd best Pixar movie behind Inside Out."
"911",5,"  For years Pixar has created animated masterpieces that combine creative storytelling and great animation, but recently they have lost their magic touch but Coco has brought back the old Pixar. I can certainly saythis is one of the best films they have ever made. The animation is rich and vibrant and the story is well crafted, clever and full of heart. The emotional moments left me in tears and the overall message is very moving. I' looking forward to seeing this movie again soon."
"912",1,"  Hollywood just keeps pumping out crap which the new Star Wars is close to falling into this realm. Or maybe it?s this millennial generation that has Hollywood moving along with the times, creating movies that suck."
"913",5,"  From 1995 to 2010 there was no doubt that Pixar was the greatest animation studio, producing huge critical and financial hits and travelling the audiences to their beautiful and imaginative worlds with their heartwarming, original and creative stories. Yes, they did make Cars back in 2006, but one film wasn't enough for the audiences to say goodbye to Pixar movies. Until that movie got a sequel. ""Cars 2"" divided audiences, leaving many widely unimpressed with its childish story. Then came ""Brave"", ""Monsters University"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"" which were all solid, but not even close to what people have come to expect from Pixar. There was still ""Inside Out"", which was a return to from and ""Finding Dory"" which was a very entertaining and succesful sequel to one of Pixar's biggest hits, 2003's ""Finding Nemo"". Earlier this year, Pixar released ""Cars 3"" which people just weren't interested in. It was better than ""Cars 2"" but still a far cry from the studio's best work. And while many thought ""Coco"" was just going to be a carbon copy of another film set in Mexico during the Day of the Dead, ""Book of Life"", the movie has actually turned out ot be one of the studio's most original, creative and breathtaking efforts yet."
"914",5,"  Coco is probably the best Disney Pixar movie I have seen to date. A story that touches the heart strings of adults and children alike. Coco carries a deep message about the importance of family values. The winning formula to this movie is that Miguel is a nobody and yet he becomes our hero. The movie sets off a new inspiring narrative for children to follow where they need to have a stronger internal locus of control and believing in making their own journey a possibility."
"915",5,"  This is my first time to cry at movie."
"916",5,"  I love this movie , it made me cry!!"
"917",5,"  Coco is one of Pixar's greatest movies, and it had an enormous difference in quality to Pixar flops as Cars 3, The Great Dinosaur, Monsters University, Brave, and Cars 2; a quality that wasn't seem since Inside-Out. The movie clearly is out of Mexican stereotypes and it shows a great query of that country's culture; in addition to it's well-created plot and screenplay, it's stunning visuals reached by an incredible CGI animation, and a good design and developments of it's lovable characters."
"918",5,"  Of all the comic book based movies of both D.C. and Marvel; this one ranked with the best! Certainly the best of the D.C. movies other then the Dark Knight.If I go further, I give away the storyline.A must see movie!"
"919",5,"  Surely one of the best animated movies I've seen in a while. The characters are relatable and feel alive. The plot seems a little bit like it has been done before but doesn't feel forced, cliched and is not really predictable and the animation is just amazing. The music is great and there are scenes that get really emotional. The way they portray mexican culture and family values feels realistic and you can tell that they did lots of research and did not just rely on stereotypes. Kind of a SPOILER here:What amazed me most about this movie how it could handle a very dark and mature story and cover it up with beautiful, creative and unique animation style.Beside the fact that the movie started out a little bit strange it just improves every minute and makes the ending feel perfect.If you haven't seen this one already, go watch it! A great adventure for children of all ages and even adults."
"920",4.5,"  Coco is a fun movie. Not only are the visuals gorgeous, the colors are vibrant along with a beautiful backdrop. The only reason there is a missing half a star is because it began to feel a bit long right before the large reveal about the main villain of the film. Luckily, it comes back and gets better right after."
"921",5,"  Pixar's Coco delivers a heartwarming story about the importance of family, phenomenal animation that's bursting with color, energy, and creativity, and lovable characters."

"923",4,"  It's been a while since I have really enjoyed a Pixar film, but Coco is one of the best that they have put out. It's not as good as say Toy Story (3 is my favorite actually), or The Incredibles, but it is very worthy. While watching this film I was taken back to one of my all time favorites The Jungle Book. The relationship between Miguel and those who are trying to help him out, especially Hector, just reminds me of Baloo and Mowgli. The movie really speaks to how we remember and honor those that we love who have passed, and how this certainly isn't something easy for us to do. The colors and lights are extremely beautiful, and I enjoyed the songs even though they do not speak to me as a style I normally would like. It's interesting that there is a bit of a lull at the end of the second act and I thought the movie was losing steam, but the final act is very much worth it, and has just spoke to me. It's not a perfect film, but man is it way better then many of the animated movies that Pixar has put out in recent years. I didn't like it quite as much as last year's Kubo and the Two Strings, but very close, and the two films actually touch on many of the same subjects."
"924",5,"  Being from MÈxico it was an awesome and fresh experience, it did not feel like it was made by americans , easily one of my favorite pixar movies."
"925",4.5,"  Coco is Pixar's new diamond, it shines from the beginning to its last minute's end."
"926",5,"  Pixar offers yet another film that is set to be remembered as an animated classic."
"927",5,"  In a period where Pixar has its ups and downs, ""Coco"" manages to meet the hights of ""Toy Story"", ""Up"" and ""Finding Nemo""."
"928",5,"  ""Coco"" is 2017's most original and emotional film."
"929",5,"  By far the most impressive animated movie of the year."
"930",5,"  With ""Coco"", Pixar offers yet another original, creative, powerful,emotional rollercoaster for audiences of all ages."
"931",5,"  Coco is a flawless masterpiece of animation and definetly one of the year's best films."
"932",5,"  This movie was the closest thing to perfection that a family movie could ever hope to be. I can't wait to buy the Blu-Ray! Spectacular!"
"933",5,"  fantastic movie that both adults and kids can enjoy!"
"934",5,"  It was a very good to see! It will make you cry for sure!"
"935",5,"  A great heartfelt story about family and how we all carry our own fears and strengths as human beings. visually captivating and culturally inspiring. I brought my two boys and we all had tears in our eyes at the emotional conclusion. Simply fantastic!"
"936",5,"  °Excelente, s√∫per Excelente!"
"937",5,"  Coco was a fantastic movie for me. I loved the colors, the songs, the story behind it all, the message. It was a fantastic movie. Very well done! Unfortunately, for a kid its too long and serious. I love that Disney/ Pixar likes targeting the entire family and is always sending a great message but the movies are just too serious for kids. I have an after school program, ages 5 - 12 years old, and for our Thanksgiving Camp we took the kids to see Coco. The movie is a good chunk of time for any kid. Kids do not have the attention spam of an adult, they get bored easily and thats exactly what happened about 30 min into the movie. And this was mostly in part of the Frozen short film that was shown prior, which lasted about 25 minutes if I'm not mistaken. The short film had all the kids puzzled and aggravated they just did not know what was going on and why they were watching Olaf sing. Then Coco began and as I mentioned 30 minutes into the movie they were all ready to go and do something else. So a good hour is what kids can handle. Hopefully, other can see what I see."
"938",5,"  Over the years since computer animation became a new medium, Pixar welcomes us with enriched storytelling that opened up new worlds from added sentimentality to something that's further wondrous. Our toys have feelings, it's tough to be a bug, monsters comes out of your closet from their world, finding family under the sea that covers most of the world, family of superheroes, what it like to go fast and slow down once in a while, what rats think about food, a cleaning robot healing a dystopian environment, an old man granting a late wish for an adventure, having control of your fate, knowing your emotions, and what if dinosaurs weren't extinct. And now, Pixar presents a story that's probably the most special out of the rest when telling a story around a cultural tradition with an enlarged meaning. Ladies and gentlemen, both dead and alive, embrace yourselves for the heart in ""Coco"".The story gracefully embraces, with much respect, the Mexican cultures with the pinnacle being the traditional holiday known as the Day of the Dead. It follows the young 12-year-old boy Miguel (voiced by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) trying to follow his dream of music like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz (voiced by Benjamin Bratt), but is forbidden to go down that path since it caused devastation of abandonment in the far past to his family. So the ban on music has been passed for generations in the family to avoid the heartbreak and the destructive ego for the individual that wants to go down that path, even though Miguel's heart is pure and loving towards his family, and desperately passionate towards music. His chance to prove his talent led him to the Land of the Dead, where he'll find out there's more to his family story than what any, both alive and dead, have known.It's always an insightful experience to interact and getting to know a different culture besides the one you're automatically accustomed to since birth, and Pixar delivers that feeling through another of their masterpieces. ""Coco"" is more of a step-up for Pixar in their qualities that are like blood cells flowing in the veins through the films: animation's more beautiful and creative, excellent performances and music, humanizing characterization, thematic elements, and heartfelt emotions; emotional soul with an adventurous heart. The addition of culture is now another of the added quality that broadens Pixar's storytelling capabilities. ""Ratatouille"" and ""Brave"" may have expressed culture but only in minimal aspects that doesn't really touch base to the origin beyond the film when it was just senses and fate in a fantasy setting, respectively. ""Coco"" manifested the Mexican culture through soul (animated and music) and vocal (talented voicing), as well meaning.While the main concept surrounds the Day of the Dead that branches out thematic elements across the film, the main theme is the love and value of family. The story of love and family is familiar in past animated films, as well when it becomes stressful if the protagonist has to be rebellious for a dream, this film follows that routine with emphasis on the stress part and a loving understanding that would exclude the supposed harshness. There's an eventual twist that occurs near the climax, and the rest from there make it more emotionally heartfelt and meaningful. The theme of family is perhaps the most outstanding quality that you won't stop thinking about after the film ends, and you'll look forward on seeing it unfolds again next time.In addition to the Mexican holiday, the film is utterly faithful to the culture in numerous aspects from the music to the performances. Probably one of the best music composers in most recent time Michael Giacchino continued his acclaimed talented taste for music to be closer to the story in tune, and this time the musical instruments were those of Mexican culture. It helps the film to be pure culture from story to tradition to solidify the soul as something special and unique from the generic presentation of others on American soil attempting culture - with not much known as of now. The vocals accompaniment were stellar and well-performed, both singing and non-singing, thanks to the all Latino cast (minus regular John Ratzenberger, whose voice wouldn't be detected anyway). Those performances put emphasis on the film's defining aspects, particularly the emotional heart and value of family, with Gonzalez's breakthrough spirited performance as the young protagonist being the standout. What manifested the culture the most, particularly the holiday as the film's concept, is in the Land of the Dead as the always-astonishing animation humanizes the skeleton characters. The reason why the skeleton characters are being given such attention for the animated merit isn't just because more than half of the film is Miguel's adventure, interaction and pursuit in the Land of the Dead but because of what they represent and how they can get attached indirectly by family ties due to the emotional embodiment of the characters. Creativity is also in the mix with the random persona of the skeletons clacking and briefly transforming their bone structures; which is another of the step-up element in the film from the masterfully detailed animation that you would expect as another special treat from Pixar.""Coco"", directed and written by Lee Unkirch and Adrian Molina, is just your average Pixar originality with greatness and such attention to all aspects for the purpose of a heartwarming, wonderful storytelling. Actually, with the thoughtful and faithful respect for the Mexican culture being an added-on that paints over the typical production merits and narrative qualities, and while it's obviously and definitely this year's best animated feature, it's perhaps the best from Pixar over ""Toy Story 3"" and a tiny bit over ""Inside Out"".

"944",5,"  A heartwarming story on the backdrop of Dia de Los Muertos about a boy pursuing his dreams, about family and about sticking to your guns no matter what. Stunning visuals with a wonderfully told story...... Coco just made me happy."
"945",3,"  Does Coco rise to the heights of Pixar's very best work? No. But it is a generous, heartfelt film, full of color and music, one that offers a timely Thanksgiving tribute to the intergenerational importance of family.- The Atlantic -"
"946",5,"  It may not be the best of Pixar, but Coco redeemed the name Pixar, and it's respect has been finally restored to this colorful animation, with a bucket filled of plot twists and silly voice acting. It may be similar to the other movie: ""The Book Of Life"", however, Coco attains to remain it's own originality, and sticks to it's mixed animation and turns it to a delight. Pixar has restored my faith in it's power."
"947",5,"  amazing story and people who live in the ""dead world"""
"948",4,"  Fun kids movie. Good music. Good story. Well done."
"949",4,"  **Slight disclaimer: My ""reviews,"" are really just gut reactions that I can remember and jot down. Forgive the sloppy styling, grammatical errors and general upheaval of my writing. While I do try and write something cohesive and obeying film review etiquette, mostly, I say fuck that. What I love about theater going, is the surge of emotions I experience, especially during a particularly bad or a truly great film. I try (and likely fail) to translate that feeling into my writing but hey, I warned you. You can stop now, and I'll never know.CocoWatched 12/3/2017I don't watch kid's movies, I don't review kids movies, I don't really like kids movies, because I am an idiot. That mentality is so dangerous and ignorant because, I just saw an amazing film. It also just so happened to be a film made for children.Disney and Pixar studios, with directors Lee Unkrich, and Adrian Molina created the dazzling, Coco.Let me backup. I just want to put it on front street just how lovely and charming and gorgeous this film is. Before Coco even started, I was already fatigued and tired. I was nearly ready to leave the theater, I just witnessed 30 minutes of various Disney trailers and commercials and then that mind numbing, 22 minute (felt more like 92 minutes) Frozen short played. So, I had already been in the theater for an hour before Coco even started.But as soon as it did...I was hooked. We are introduced to one of the most beautiful cinematic worlds I've ever been in. It was like what Guillermo Del Toro imagines when he gets gassed at the dentist. We bounce between two amazing environments. A very real Mexican village and a very un-real Land of the Dead, both are overflowing with color, culture, music, lights, boisterous characters, zany animals, and most of all music.I knew nothing about this movie going in, so I'll return the favor.Just know that it's not the most original or crazily unique story I've seen. A similar film The Book of Life was released just a few years ago. Yet Coco captured my imagination, it's asks universal questions that we want answers to. It's done so that, a six-year-old and a sixty-year-old can go into this film and both come out feeling uplifted and pleased. There is some heavy subject matter here that will go over the heads of kids, but sorta fucked me up. Dealing with the ever-increasing awareness of mortality, disappearing heritage, and our forgotten ancestors. Being of Mexican and Spanish descent myself, certain aspects of this movie hit me on unexpected levels. The resolution of the film closes nicely, yet the thoughts occupied my headspace for a while after exiting the theater. Anyways, on to something happier.The voice acting is phenomenal, the film is largely music based and the range of voices unleashed on us is terrific. Our main character Miguel, played lovingly by new actor Anthony Gonzalez, the velvety, instantly recognizable voice of Gael Garcia Bernal, the boisterous bellow of Benjamin Bratt, the feisty Renee Victor and the numerous vocal cameos throughout the film. Collectively, it felt so alive and real that it may be the best voice cast I've heard from both studios.I know the Disney/Pixar conglomerate does amazing work. I liked Toy Story, and Monsters Inc, and Nemo, I am human. I just don't go out of my way to see them. Coco along with many other films this year continue to remind me of the fact that films (kids or otherwise) shouldn't be judged, they should be experienced. Why judge a movie simply based on its targeted demographic? If it does what it's supposed to do and is seems interesting, go see it, give it the chance to surprise you. This is why I love film so much, I am always learning from them, I get life and inspiration from awesome movies and I am so lucky that I can share that love and enthusiasm with my friends and readers.Unless it's that Frozen short...that totally sucked."
"950",3.5,"  Puntaje Original: 7.5Otra m·gica pel√≠cula de Pixar, con entra√±ables personajes, muy colorida y musicalmente espl√©ndida. Coco cuenta con un gran mensaje que la vuelve ideal para ver en familia."
"951",5,"  A very enjoyable movie."
"952",5,"  Coco beautifully explains the special meaning of Dia de Los Muertos in a way that's gentle enough for kids to learn about death and that as long as we remember our loved ones, they will live in our hearts forever with the hope that we may reunite again one day. I will be seeing Coco for the 4th time today!"
"953",4,"  Pixar manages to make a tale about betrayal, death, and the afterlife into a miraculously joyful and fun family film. Visually this is one of their most impressive achievements, and conceptually this is the strongest Pixar film since Inside Out."
"954",5,"  The most amazing movie!!Passion Vs Curse"
"955",5,"  Love this movie :') Good Job Pixar!"
"956",5,"  I loved it! The plot was fun, the graphics were beautiful, and the music was great."
"957",4,"  Another Pixar home run."
"958",3.5,"  This was a cute movie that was enlightening on Mexican culture. It was a bit slow and was not as musical as I assumed it would be, as a movie that is based around music. I really do like this movie and I will watch it again. It is a spectacle."
"959",4.5,"  A beautiful animation that shows culture and heart. Despite his family's baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel (voice of newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin Bratt). Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events. Along the way, he meets charming trickster Hector (voice of Gael Garc√≠a Bernal), and together, they set off on an extraordinary journey to unlock the real story behind Miguel's family history.To be completely honest, I had only seen one trailer for this film and I had zero interest. I barely knew what it was about other than Pixar was releasing this film. And to be frank, I just really didn't want to see it. However when I visited my hometown in Washington for Thanksgiving, I decided to utilize my MoviePass and take a trip to the theaters. To no surprise, I really enjoyed the film. It surpassed my expectations and it's definitely a film that I'll remember. To start off, this film is absolutely stunning. Pixar shows us why they're one of the best, if not the best animation studios in existence. The artists and the animators behind this film did a fantastic job. Everything looked extremely detailed and it looked crazy. Every fine grain and every color was given careful attention to and it definitely showed. This honestly looks better than any other animation I've seen this year and it's easily one of Pixar's most beautiful films. The overall story is very strong and emotional. The base of this film is really simple, if not a little bit cliche. But the writers here really knew what kind of film they wanted it to be and that's what made it special. Every beat in this film was so well written and it blew any ""generic"" possibility out of the water. It's an adventure for a young boy who loves music and it certainly doesn't disappoint. The story is exciting, eventful, and it kept me hooked throughout. I think this is just a really beautiful animation in general. It has a lot of strong motifs and themes that can be applied to many parts of our daily lives. It's something that can appeal to both mass audiences and small niches because it's not just a kids film. It's a kids film that can be entertaining for older audiences. There are just so many aspects that mesh well together and it makes this a very nice and heart warming film.In the end, ""Coco"" was a fantastic film and one of the highlights of the year."
"960",5,"  The afterlife has been at the center of many films in the past. Man's fascination with death and what may come afterward has always been a wealthy fodder for faith and art, and cinema is no exception. Since 1911's L'INFERNO ( Giuseppe De Liguoro, Adolfo Padovan, Francesco Bertolini) portrayed a chilling vision of Dante's hell, the after-world has been a constant presence in movies, being visited on occasion by Hercules, Santo, or even Robin Williams. Its portrayal has been at times grim, terrifying, institutional or spectacular.Pixar's COCO falls into that latest category. It's probably the most gorgeous depiction of the Great Beyond, with its vibrant bridge of flowing petals linking the world of the living to a stunningly colourful Netherworld. The contrast could have been expressed in the same way the land of the dead was distinguished from the real world by having the latter look desaturated, like in Burton's THE CORPSE BRIDE. But directors Lee Unkrich (TOY STORY 2 and 3) and Adrian Molina tried a different approach.The Mexican town in which lives young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) remains sunny and vibrant, exhibiting all the bright festive hues associated with the Dia de Muertos celebrations, and yet the afterlife still manages to turn the colour knob all the way to 11.COCO follows the adventures of young Miguel, who wants nothing more than become a musician like the celebrated Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), thus defying the family's shoe-making tradition. As he attempts to ''borrow'' the deceased Ernesto's guitar from his crypt, he is sent to the Land of the Dead, and can only return home if a dead relative offers him his blessings. Not an easy task, as his dead family, like the living one, opposes his dreams of being a musician. They resent Miguel's great-grandfather who left his family to pursue his own musical ambitions, never to return.Deeply rooted in a Mexican culture, COCO nonetheless suffers from Disney boiling down the essence of that very culture to often trite stereotypes; The dead sports the decorated sugar skulls associated with D√≠a de Muertos. You get mariachis, Frida Kahlo and masked wrestlers (with a cameo appearance by the Legendary Santo in the After Life). However, it's difficult in an animated movie to stay away from cultural clich√©s, as was the case with the Guillermo Del Toro produced THE BOOK OF LIFE, which shares a certain amount of plot points with COCO. They also fish out other worthwhile aspects of Hispanic folklore in inspired moments, like for instance a traditional song about la Llorona (A spine-chilling fable about a crying woman's ghost, forever mourning her slain children). Furthermore, there has been attempts of late by Disney/Pixar to redeem themselves by avoiding the typical whitewashing. MOANA had Hawaiian actors and The Rock (who has Samoan descent) playing Polynesians, all citizens of the wider Pacific Islands. In COCO, the cast is mostly populated by Hispanics. While some of them are well known performers, none are of the calibre of the stars that often do voices in such animated fare. Although it can be argued that Disney doesn't really need stars to sell at this point, and that type of casting can further help to absolve the lack of cultural subtlety. COCO further tried to ''pander'' by having its premiere in Mexico, a whole week ahead of the rest of the world.What matters in the end is the movie's impact, and in this case, COCO packs a heck of an sentimental wallop. Like most Pixar movies, it grounds its story in a very human principle which in this case is our relationship with the afterlife, and this need to be remembered. It's the basic emotional core of COCO, and it reaches a particular crescendo when the titular character, who is a secondary player in appearance, but drives the whole story, is starting to forget about one of her dead relative, threatening to cause his ''second death'' in the the Land of the Dead. It brings home some powerful concepts that may escape the kiddies, but that most adults will be able to relate to. It's particularly poignant to name a movie that deals mostly with the importance of living in one's memories, after a character who is obviously battling Alzheimer's disease. The scene where Miguel attempts to jog her remembrance with a song (a technique that has proven effective in real life) that had until then being used in a rather smarmy way in the film, will make the most hardhearted cry their eyes out.In short, Pixar has done it again, creating a touching, gorgeous and ultimately relevant movie that will bring a certain amount of food for thoughts to the young and older ones, dazzle with its vibrant palette, and stand the test of time with its strong emotional core, providing an answer to the query posed by its Oscar bait of a theme song: ''Remember me.''We certainly will."
"961",5,"  Visually stunning as much as it is heart warming. Coco tackles difficult topics like death and the afterlife with just the right amount of humor."
"962",4.5,"  The Book of Life was one of my favorite films of 2014. When I first saw the trailer for Coco, it was hard not for me to draw comparisons. A celebration of the Day of the Dead. Mariachi. Centered around music. Coco brings its own flavor, however, a unique experience all its own. In fact, if it weren't for the god-awful twenty-five-minute Frozen short right before (since removed due to numerous complaints), this would have been close to a perfect moviegoing experience.Little Miguel loves music. He has to sneak away to watch old recordings of his favorite musician Ernesto de la Cruz because the rest of his family thinks music is a curse. Following a mysterious chain of events (don't want to ruin it for you), Miguel finds himself in the Land of the Dead and must somehow find a way to get home before its too late.The colors. Oh man, the colors. Vibrant, popping off the screen. It screams life even during the scenes in the Land of the Dead. This is one film I wish I would have seen in IMAX. The colors add an amazing pop, from the spirit animals to the city landscapes at night, making this one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen.The colors alone are just a small touch to the overall creativity and originality behind Coco. The Land of the Dead is loaded with sights to behold, some you might miss if you blink. The attention to detail is spectacular from the cool bridge that guides the dead to the Land of the Living to the colorful spirit animals. I've seen a lot of movies and I haven't seen anything like this. Not only are the visuals amazing, but the music holds its own as well, driving the entire story in an entertaining and powerful way. There are a lot of touching moments that revolve around the soundtrack. There will be musical numbers that make you laugh while others leave you with more of a somber feel. Maybe I cried a little. Maybe I didn't. You'll never know for sure. One thing I can say is this movie was about as touching as any I have seen this year.Disney/Pixar is known for leaving you with a great message and Coco is no exception. Miguel was willing to follow his dreams at all costs, even if it cost him his life. How many of us can say the same? Another phenomenal job by Pixar. I give the film a 96."
"963",4,"  I loved this movie so much I want to see it again"
"964",5,"  Best Pixar movie in years"
"965",4,"  'Coco' is a surprisingly touching and enjoyable adventure. It always tackles sensitive topics such as death and familial feud with engaging performances and fun, heartwarming moments. One can tell that care went into making sure that there is as little dead space in between events and that slower scenes are still beautiful and entertaining. The music is noteworthy too, as it should be for a film of this kind, and serves as a vehicle that connects the audience to Mexico and its culture. 'Coco' is somewhat of a triumph in an age where I though all the big animation houses were past their ability to create a above-average features."
"966",5,"  Pixar did it again, so touching"
"967",4.5,"  Very well done animated film. I enjoyed the visual style quite a bit, and enjoyed the exploration of Mexican culture."
"968",5,"  Absolutely spectacular movie !! I must own this and watch ALL the special features and ?making of? features - cried sooo much and could hear ppl crying in the theatre - bring your tissues - the importance of familia is so pronounced in this movie and the real explanation of what the day of the dead represents for Mejicanos is awesome"
"969",4.5,"  Best animated film this year for sure"
"970",4.5,"  Absolutely loved it. Besides being adorable, it had a great message. I found myself at least 6 times saying, ""Unbelievable"" when referring to the animation. So lifelike, so real. Really well done. [4.5 stars]"
"971",4,"  Visually a pleasure (just beautiful) and a great plot where a young boy learns about his ancestors in the land of the dead."
"972",4.5,"  A wonderful Movie, showing the beauty in music, and how it can bring humanity, family, and people apart or together once again. It takes place in Mexico, and shows that we must always remember our loved ones, through memory, songs, pictures and gifts, so that they can still meet us even when we are at the other side."
"973",4.5,"  Pixar did it again, by striking gold with this much needed film, specially in this times of diplomatic tension between the United States and Mexico. (On a small note, the Adidas as seen within a Mexico footbal soccer shirt, joins Babie and Mr. Potato Head, as one of the real brands seen within a Pixar film.)"
"974",5,"  This movie gets you all up in the feels, so damn touching and beautiful. I really can't find anything to complain about this movie. Pixar is over here trying to make you feel worse than the first 10mins of UP, when it gets there it will hit you(assuming you have a heart). This movie brought mexican culture front and center in an easy to digest format."
"975",4.5,"  Sometimes predictable but still charming and thoughtful, Coco is led by two main characters with enough chemistry to pull it off. The music and the visuals fit as the perfect frame for one of, if not THE, best animated movie of the year."
"976",4,"  A standard retelling of the hero's journey can get predictable (see: Robots). And while the beats in Coco are familiar, there is plenty in this movie to think about: what if chasing your dream means leaving your family? What kind of family isn't supportive of your dream? The answers given in Coco are a little too neat and tidy, but that doesn't mean that the movie doesn't offer genuine emotion through its visuals, its music, and its story. While the world-building isn't as imaginative as Inside Out or WALL-E, the design of the Land of the Dead is something to behold, a Pixar version of a less-depressing Blade Runner."
"977",5,"  great movie! even with the apology before the film"
"978",5,"  AMAZING loved every second I started to cry a lot"
"979",5,"  A most excellent and touching tale about the importance of family!! Very well done with great visuals, music, and a story with lots of heart. Highly recommended for the whole family!"
"980",4.5,"  INCREDIBLE! This was almost as good as Inside Out! Go see this one if you haven't already."
"981",5,"  This movie has a very strong message compared to other movies I've seen like oml this legit made me cry a gallon"
"982",5,"  This movie was one of the best Disney movies ever. I was born '93 and I have been waiting for a good Disney movie for a while now. Thank you!! you need more like these. great story something we can relate too."
"983",5,"  A beautifully told story with spectacular visual effects. And with such powerful scenes, some which are enough to make a grown man cry. Best movie I watched all year."
"984",5,"  Such an amazing movie. The special effects, graphics, and moral of the story are all amazing. We will be buying this movie when it comes out on DVD."
"985",5,"  a masterpiece, a true testament of the mexican culture, a heartfelt movie that can make you laugh, cry and specially sing, oh my Pixar you have done it again"
"986",5,"  Let me preface my review by saying this. I'm against illegal immigration (And overly-generous ""legal"" immigration. I hate pushin 1 for english, and I'm pretty pissed that my kid's neighborhood school was turned into a nursery for anchor babies and outright illegals, and he was kicked-out becuz he doesn't speak SPANISH! I realize that Hollywood is without xception, diametrically opposed to my position on these issues, so I went into Coco, xpecting to see a thinly-veiled political agenda, but, all I saw was a brilliantly-animated, heartwarming, story, with some surprise plot twists. As parents, we must frequently ""take 1 for the team"", and take our kids to movies we know are gonna be awful, cuz they wanna see'em, but, rest easy, Mom n Dad, while we might feel the ticket price could be abit lower, takin the shorties to see Coco's money well-spent! If it makes u feel any better, u can wear your ""MAGA"" hat! ??"
"987",4,"  I found this very entertaining. I don't like cartoons or anime very much so that says alot for me. I would recommend - one hundred percent for parents and children and 85 percent for adults and seniors only"
"988",5,"  Very interesting movie. You learn about the mexican culture, and the importance of remembering with joy the people you loved that passed away. We keep the alive in our hearts."

"1",5,"  Great Movie! Loads of fun and a glimpse into what our future will be like."
"2",2,"  CGI was good but childish storyline and characters makes it a very forgettable movie."
"3",5,"  Led by charismatic performances from Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, Ready Player One is proof that Steven Spielberg is still going strong. It combines state of the art special effects, a simple yet heartwarming story, and more pop culture references that anyone could possibly count in the best way possibly, and features the single greatest large-scale battle I've ever seen put to film. It's not perfect, but it might be the single most fun movie of 2018 so far."
"4",2,"  If tou have not read the book this isn't a bad movie. I did read and loved the book and was excited to see the movie. However the movie diverged from the book quite a lot in my opinion and too much was lost in attempt to fit the storyline into a single movie. It has be generisized for hollywood. There was not enough character development which made the emotions feel forced. There was so much potential for this movie and I think the squandered it. It should have been a trilogy. I don't think this will be a movie I will watch more than once."
"5",4,"  Just like the song ""A world with pure imagination"""
"6",4.5,"  This is just one of the movies that you cant watch only once. May be the best movie of March"
"7",1,"  Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. If you don't already play an obnoxious amount of video games you will despise this movie. My husband dragged me to this movie and I feel like I have wasted over 2 hrs of my time ."
"8",4.5,"  Ready Player One is definitely one of my Spielberg favourites. I loved the action and plot in general."
"9",4,"  Didn't know anything about the movie before watching it, and man did I like it :) You kind of have to be a gamer and a pop culture nerd to like it, but it you are, you are going to love it."
"10",5,"  Love it. like reliivng your teen years. Broght back so many memories, a reall buz for a scfi fantasy horror movie kid of the 70's & 80's. µde me relive them all."
"11",1,"  If you read the book and then watch this movie, be prepared to live disappointment, feel actual disappointment for the first time in your life. I can't get back the time I waisted, nor the money. Aside from the insane graphics, this is what you call a major fuck up."
"12",4.5,"  Ready Player One is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Simon Pegg, T.J Miller and Ben Mendelsohn.It tells the story Based on the Ernest Cline's 2011 novel of the same name, in the not to distance future, where the planet is pretty much mess up. When one James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and his partner Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) create the first virtual reality world called the Oasis, it becomes an instant success. It's a place in which you can be anyone and do whatever you want and the perfect place to escape the awful world.After parting ways with his business partner, Halliday runs the company alone and when he finally dies years later, he releases his final challenge to the world. He tells people across the globe that he has placed an Easter Egg deep within the Oasis and whoever finds it will inherit all of his assets and the Oasis itself. Of course, to find it, you have to first find three keys, or clues, to unlock the egg's precise location, and it's no easy task.Set in Columbus, Ohio, we meet Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), a young man who lives in the Stacks. A trailer park from hell, Wade has a pretty miserable existence in the real world. But he finds solace in the Oasis as his cool avatar Parzival, hanging with his avatar pals and desperately trying to crack Halliday's challenge. When Wade/Parzival meets Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), his entire game and life changers.The performances are all top-notch, especially from Sheridan and Cooke, who gel well together onscreen. Cooke particularly is engaging when she's being her avatar Art3mis, full of cute swagger and confidence. Ben Mendelsohn chews it up with the best of them, and it's perfectly fine for him to go over the top. Other standouts include the always-good Mark Rylance, as the sweet, kind-hearted, geeky moral centre of the film.The true star of the film, however, is the Oasis. It's simply the place to be, especially through Spielberg's visual mind. No offense to the actors, but you are instantly sucked in the minute any of the characters put on their VR goggles, and you're completely engrossed in the action sequences. The sights and sounds are nothing short of amazing, and you can actually feel Spielberg just giddily revelling in all the high-tech visuals he can create.The film is also an ode to the 1980s, Ready Player One spoke to me on many levels. I felt like it was made for me. Author Cline co-wrote the script with Zak Penn, and the two are kindred spirits, stuffing the film full of that era's references. So is Spielberg, to some degree, because it's in the late '70s and '80s when the director perfected his craft.It's not just the '80s being represented in the Oasis, but a number of great pop culture references, from beloved characters like the Iron Giant to King Kong and so much more. Ready Player One could be one of those movies that can appeal to just about everybody, even younger audiences who should appreciate the high-tech gadgetry and modern-day gamer mentality.Penn and Cline have craft a narrative that isn't necessarily surprising in its set-up but grabs you nonetheless, and while the film does seem to drag a little the closer we come to the climax, along with some characters sadly unused, Ready Player One is a Triumph."
"13",4.5,"  For a pertinent use of pop culture icons. Being a critic towards production using fan service to well their movies. Showing that geek community is important and can't be neglected"
"14",5,"  I saw this in 3D imax, which was AMAZING. Being 3D, it was like being in the virtual reality right along with the characters. The story was simple enough to follow and challenging enoug to provoke contemplation. It was neither a drama, action, romcom, or horror movie. It was all of them. This was as well rounded, innovative and visually stunning as avator. HIGHLY recommend."
"15",5,"  AWESOME MOIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"16",5,"  It's totally awesome. A fantastic experience in the Oasis."
"17",0.5,"  If you like seeing a random sequence of things that showed up in 1980's media uninterrupted by plot or character development, this is the movie for you."
"18",4.5,"  READY PLAYER ONE will surely be one of the most exciting films to come out this year: it is another instant classic that is another vibrant part of Steven Spielberg's almost unparalleled catalogue of work. Younger filmmakers could learn a lot from this old master."
"19",4,"  Stephan Spielberg knows his audience. If you understand and appreciate the message behind the movie in addition to the glorious cultural references, you will love this movie guaranteed. IF you don't get any of it, well the movie wasn't meant for you and I suggest you leave it be. I admit the story is a result of a weird mashup but the movie is an enjoyable one nonetheless."
"20",4.5,"  Spielbergs best work in almost a decade.Truly a movie that deserves to be called a movie.You can feel and see in almost every single shot how much love writers,creators and actors put into this.Sheridan and especially Cooke deliver stellar performances and easily carry the whole movie as it would be nothing.I didnt like all of the changes from the book but can understand for most of them why they had to be made,so all in all most changes make sense.As a huge fan of Cline`s Novel i still have to admit : The Movie has its flaws.Especially the World Building,the Weight of the Oasis within the Real World etc. is almost entirely missing.And even tho i can forgive that(i think a lot easier to forgive if you know the book) that in combination with the not-so-great Sorento casting casts a tiny bit of a shadow about a great movie experience."

"23",3,"  An action adventure geared towards younger audiences that faills far below the expectations created by the book. The movie makers said ""show me the money,"" and delivered a fast paced video game, that while hitting the major plot points, lacked the gravity of human issues, world building, and character development that makes the book great. Would have rather had a series of movies that told the story well, than one rushed movie that fit into a one movie made to appeal to the commercial masses."
"24",5,"  This movie was a lot of fun. Those who are complaining about seeing stuff they love being used in a new setting, chill out. Enjoy life, stop dragging everything down. This was a fun movie."
"25",3.5,"  To be honest I like the plot, it is easy to understand but when I asked friends about the movie they barely remembered it not to say it wasn't memorable but they actually spent more time searching for references to other franchises which I'm going to admit, watching a Gundam fight Mechagodzilla gave me a total nerdgasm."
"26",4.5,"  Ready Player One was a fun movie. While I had not read the book, my friend who had said it was totally different but still a good movie. I enjoy CGI when the story supports it, which this totally did. the acting was good, tbe story good though a little predictable, but still a lot of fun. The movie trailer does not do the movie justice; the movie is better than the trailer suggests."
"27",3.5,"  The story telling is too long and almost went to being bored. But the last 45 minutes is awesome and exiting."
"28",1,"  Hope you weren't expecting anything even close to book. Artemis was turned into a bimbo. And it was a complete rewrite. If I hadn't had my kids I would have walked out"
"29",5,"  Honestly, probably the best movie I've seen in a while. It was a thrilling, hilarious adventure that made 2 hours seem like 30 min. I wanted more. The best part was the references to about 90% of my fandoms. I will own this movie when it comes out, and I will watch it more than once. Well done, Spielberg. Well done."
"30",1.5,"  I was excited for this movie as i really enjoyed the book but... plain and simple i found it rather bad. Many of the plot lines from the book are are either skipped or done away with all together. The characters are misrepresented e.g. in the book Aech is described as a ""athletic Caucasian heterosexual male""(ch. 33) but in the movie he is some sort of robotic ogre person In the end despite the movies over 2 hour run time it felt rushed. I feel that this movie would be more enjoyable if the audience member has NOT read the book and has no intention of doing so. Either watch the movie or read the book or do both and face disappointment."
"31",3,"  I know its not always fair to compare the book with the movie, but sometimes its hard not to and in this case, it strayed REALLY far from the source material. As a movie, it was pretty good and the visuals were really good. If I had not read the book, I think I would have loved it, but the book is WAY better. And it seems odd that Steven went that far out of the way to change so many details from the book. But a good watch nonetheless."
"32",1,"  This review is full of spoilers. You have been warned. We all remember that amazing feeling. We get home from school, run into the living room, boot up our console and wait for our favorite game to load. As it turns on, we get ready to battle, and the game lets us know it's time as those familiar words flash before our eyes: ""Ready Player One.""You would think a movie that was called ""Ready Player One"" would at least include those beautiful words the very first time our protagonist, Wade Watts, logs into the Oasis, right? Well, not so much.In a movie literally called Ready Player One, there wasn't much emphasis on actual gaming. This is the very first place where this movie goes so terribly wrong. Alright, but let's back up a bit. Ready Player One is based on the best-selling Ernest Cline novel of the same name. This dystopian book is set in a post-apocalyptic America in the not so distant future. The basic background we get at the beginning of the book is that our world has gone to shit. In the year 2044 the world has been facing an energy crisis for decades that was caused by global warming, overpopulation, and the depletion of fossil fuels. Basically, the world was destroyed by...humans. Rather than doing something to fix the problems they caused, humans escaped into a world of virtual reality, and began to live, work, and even get married to people they have never actually met, all inside the MMORPG called, The OASIS. The world is going to hell, but the OASIS is actually fairly stable. The OASIS has its own government, where Wil Wheaten is President, and the OASIS currency is actually much stronger than any you could get in real life.However, things get interesting when James Halliday, the reclusive creator of the Oasis dies, leaving behind no heir to inherit his vast fortune, and control of his company and all of the OASIS. So, Halliday leaves behind an Easter Egg in his game. Anyone who finds it, will win his entire estate, and the right to run the OASIS.The problem is, the company IOI is after the OASIS for profit. Nolan Sorrento, IOI's CEO, wants to make players charge for the right to access the OASIS. Since the world has basically been destroyed and a very small percentage of people control the world's tangible wealth, the only good thing most people have in their lives is the OASIS.Okay, so why I am giving you this vast background on the book? It's to highlight one of the biggest problems in the film adaptation of the novel. THERE ARE STAKES. The action of this story is fueled by the fact that if IOI gains control of the OASIS there will be no more reason for most of the world's population to even want to keep living. Most people work inside the Oasis, so if they have to pay a monthly fee just to get to work, what chance do they ever have of getting ahead? In the book, most people are starving because there is literally not enough food left on earth. This novel is brilliant, but I obviously knew there was absolutely NO WAY this movie would be able to replicate the epic quest laid out in the books pages, but I had really hoped that the spirit of the story would remain intact. In fact, I couldn't find anything in this movie that reminded me of the source material. There are serious spoilers ahead, so continue reading with caution.In the book, it was important to Halliday that a student find the first key. He wanted a regular person to begin this journey, so to start the movie with Wade already being this amazing Gunter, with amazing weapons, and a freaking DeLorean immediately made me feel like I wasn't connected to his character. He was clearly not a regular guy. Also, making Wade, Aech, and Art3mis go to school adds that human element that is missing from the film. People still have to have lives. They have to go to school or work. I mean yes, they go to school in the OASIS, fine. But they still have the expectation to do the boring monotonous things in life. It would have made the movie feel more real. It also, again, would have added additional stakes. ""I can't find the egg and save the OASIS from IOI until I finish school, otherwise I'll get kicked out of school and lose my internet access, gloves, and goggles to access the OASIS.""Also, I felt cheated that the movie picked up in the middle of the hunt. They dismissed whoever it was that figured out the first clue was a race...except.... how did they figure it out? It made NO sense that it would be a race based on Halliday's first clue, and it felt like cheating to skip over that.Then there is the fact that the spirit of the quest was completely altered in this adaptation. The quest itself should have felt like an adventure, but it was just a series of random events that led to a key. I mean, I obviously wanted to see Parzival Joust for the key against Acererak - but if that wasn't possible in the movie for whatever reason couldn't we have at least flavored the challenge to be similar? Spielburg used a flashy car chase because he wanted to be flashy. It wasn't about storytelling, it was about special effects. The quest for each key felt so lazy and figuring out the challenge was so easy for everyone that once again, there were no stakes. I get it, it was a race to beat IOI, but it should have been about so much more.In the book, IOI has castle Anorak encased in the Orb of Osuvox for like a month while the other Gunters hurried to figure out the last clue and catch up, but Sorrento and his band of Sixers (Suxors, as the book called them which would have made for an entertaining addition to this movie) couldn't figure out how to use the key and get past the gate because it never occurred to people so greedy to work together. IOI only used the Cataclyst to blow up the planet after Parzival and his friends showed them how to open the gate. I mean, that's an actual reason why IOI would destroy so many of its own Avatars. It wasn't just because Sorerento was throwing a hissy fit. That's also high stakes. IOI had a month, alone with the key and they couldn't figure it out. Let's address some other issues with the movie. Firstly, how the hell was it so damn easy for everyone to find each other? Daito and Shoto are in Japan in the book, which gives a broader scope to the story. This isn't a book about America, it's a book about the world. Also, Wade would have NEVER just told all of his friends how to find the first key. It's so dumb that the movie copped out like that. It goes against everything his character stood for, which is why it made more sense that Daito and Shoto don't meet Parzival, Art3mis, and Aech until after they find the key for themselves. This is where the movie continues to lack a human connection. Life just doesn't work this way. People don't all just magically find each other, and the entire freaking world is not based in Ohio. It's just...ugh. Let's get to Arti for a minute. In the books, saving the OASIS is the most important thing there is. She kind of hates that Z just wants to take the money and run. She wants to save the OASIS so she can use the money, the power, and the resources to save the world. She wants to feed people, get them into safe housing, and clean up the streets. She fights off Wade's attraction because she cannot afford to get sidetracked. Even at the end, when they are in the same house, she refuses to meet him in person until one of them has the egg. It's too important to let her emotions compromise what she views as the fate of the planet. That's a great character. She is driven, smart, complex, scared...she is real. Arti in the movie is flat. She dumps Z, but then...just kidding, ""I was really just coming to find you all along."" The fact that they meet so early in the movie takes away something so beautiful. It takes away the longing, the fight for their relationship, and the eventual terror he feels when he finds out her life is in danger. Also, that whole, ""I'm gonna fall on my own sword and be captured because you are the only one who can save the Oasis"" shit she pulls in the movie is so dumb. She would have been like, ""try to keep up, fool.""And why does EVERYONE just bow down to Wade and act like he is the only one who can win for the entire movie? I mean, racing against the Sixers is good, but why can't you also be racing against each other? It just would have made a much more interesting story.Getting back to my argument that there were no stakes in this movie, let's talk about Daito for a moment. His death in the book changes the entire dynamic of the hunt, and the race to beat the sixers. Daito dies, IRL, at the hands of IOI and that changes everything. I mean, we already knew Sorrento was capable of this, but for him to actually murder a member of the High Five is a wakeup call. It changes the way Wade views the entire quest and is probably what makes him allow himself to get arrested by IOI (under a fake name) and use his resources as an ""employee"" (with the help of some sweet hacker backdoor codes) to take down the Orb protecting Castle Anorak. Speaking of which, how the hell was it so easy to get out of IOI? I mean, Arti got her detector and alarm off easily enough...fine. Let's ignore that. But then she breaks into Sorrento's office unnoticed, gets out just as easily, then goes into the IOI war room, kills other sixers USING A SIXER AVATAR, and nobody thinks to take off their damn helmet and find the Sixer who is killing them all? Also, literally everyone is looking for her and they don't realize she is still inside IOI headquarters. You got drones that can find a dude with a face tattoo in five minutes, but you don't have security cameras in your headquarters? Seriously? Also, she is in a Sixer Suit, using a Sixer account, wearing a Sixer uniform. So how do we see her inside the Oasis as her own avatar. That is ridiculous. This is where I will address the movie fails in even following its own rules. Early on, it is established that to run and move your own body in the Oasis, you need a Haptic Suit. So how the hell are people just running around in the streets in Cleveland, wearing regular clothes, but still somehow shooting at everyone in the Battle for Castle Anorak? It makes no sense.Also, I challenge you to run around a busy street, with your eyes covered, pretending to be battling someone, and not get yourself run over by a bus. This is not real life, people. I think the actors were fine. They seemed well cast and may have been good if they had been given better writing. I mean, come on with this one. ""I won't be like Halliday. I'll jump."" Wade says, as he kisses, Samantha. I mean...really? That's the best you have. My friend groaned out loud in the theater with that one.The actor who played Halliday did a nice job, and so props to him, but Simon Pegg was painfully under utilized as Ogdon Morrow. I think I would have given the entire movie a break if they had allowed him to be the one who saves Z and Arti in the nightclub by using his overly strong, immortal OASIS avatar, ""The Great and Powerful Og."" That scene in the book was amazing and was 100% the reason why I was excited about Pegg's casting in this film. Also, I liked that it was Og who got the kids to safety in the end. He was so disgusted at the evil way IOI was twisting Halladay's challenge, that though he wouldn't interfere with the game, he also wouldn't let the kids get murdered. Stakes. We keep coming back to that. I wanted to like this film. I really really wanted to, but in the end, I didn't enjoy it at all. It focused 100% on special effects and failed where movies matter most: In the telling of a story and creation of characters the audience actually cares about."
"33",5,"  I loved the movie and it was amazing incredibly amazing the only two things is I wanted to see WAIT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT okay I wanted just o see tracer from overwatch shake hands with the Scout from Team Fortress 2 as they attack the shield and the guards I also wanted to see As everyone was attacking the shield and troopers I wanted to see a trooper look down and see a Uganda knuckles and he Spits on the trooper and then a bunch more Uganda knuckles come and spit on him and he just dies from the spit it would be funny but other then that it's a great movie go watch it"
"34",4,"  I thought this was great. A little flawed, but still great. It just appeared that Spielberg really wanted to make Avatar, Lord Of The Rings, another Kubrick film, and everything else, and did just that in one movie. Still fun to see everything whizzing by though."
"35",0.5,"  Garbage.About 3% similar to the book."
"36",0.5,"  This movie sucked. They change everything that they could possibly have changed from the book. I loved the book, and was very bored and disappointed when watching the movie. Even if I didn't read the book, I still would have hated the movie."
"37",5,"  While it doesnt follow tbe plot points of the book the characters are faithful to their book versions and it is true to the spirit of the book. Very entertaining!"
"38",5,"  LOVED this movie, the pop culture references hit the sweet spot between not enough and too much. it was fun in its story and was very refreshing. I will be seeing it again."
"39",1.5,"  Didn't care for it. the graphics weren't that good, the jokes weren't funny, the story wasn't very engaging, the story had moments that were way too convenient, and the plot kind of just broke into pieces at the end."
"40",5,"  it was a cool movie. very creative.loved every minute of it."
"41",4.5,"  Good movie, surprisely funny. Enjoyable for a family or a date night."
"42",5,"  Loved it!! Ending dragged on a little, but was such an awesome movie and would 100% see again!"
"43",4,"  Ready Player is a solid movie with likeable characters and lots of nostalgia. Familiar faces I know of from video games are super cool to see and Spielberg placed them and used them well. I liked it."
"44",4,"  Ready Player One is almost like a cinematic sci-fi love letter to hardcore fans of 80's and 90's gaming, pop culture, movies, books, etc. And to an extent, a message to Generation X, Millenials, and generations beyond. It is a beautiful virtual world (like Tron: Legacy and Wreck it Ralph) built within the ""real world"" that could actually be one of mankind's possible futures. Now I've never read the source material but the film on it's own is just amazing. The CGI action is very good and the easter eggs are boundless, there will be something current or nostalgic here for everyone at some point that will touch your heart. While the visuals are great, there is a mystery, treasure hunting adventure here (and some romance) with a background of a very ultra materialistic (digital and physical) future for humankind. The plot is engaging enough that you almost forget that most of the world is now ""plugged in"" and escapes reality as much as possible. This itself will bring much discussion amongst your friends. I for one, would have loved if we could see more of the outside world. Just like you had to watch E.T., the first Jurassic Park or Star Wars, Indiana Jones or even Avatar; This movie has to be seen. Give it a shot, especially in IMAX 3D lol. Final Review: 9.5 out of 10"
"45",2.5,"  There are better and easier ways to watch a man jack his meat for 2 hours. Ready Player One relies on references as a crutch to support a stale story."
"46",3,"  Kind of routine actually, more people, less games, a nice ending."
"47",3.5,"  This movie was very cool and intense."
"48",4.5,"  Throughly entertaining, great soundtrack, packed with tons of references. Spielberg kills it again!"
"49",5,"  Was a very fun watch"
"50",3.5,"  I can't say if this movie sticks close to the book, but I will say it was a fun journey, overall. The movie relied heavily on the 80s nostalgia but they did so in a charming way. Only time will tell if it holds up in the future."
"51",1,"  Absolute abomination.Does not stay true to the book, it misses out all the best points in the story line and all the 80s culture /film/TV and music references. Spielberg has turned a geeky, interesting and clever book into a complete nonsense action film.Seriously disappointed in this film that I had been awaiting to see for a long time!"
"52",3.5,"  Wasn't expecting much. Spielberg can still schpiel. Remember Jaws?"
"53",0.5,"  Me recuerda a Sword Art On Line pero mal hecha y absurda, el uso de la nostalgia es lo que llama la atención, la neta de weba esta pelicula."
"54",5,"  I created an account to rate this movie and Im 32. I hadn't read the book, and I'm sure the only true issue I have with the movie would be somewhat resolved in a novel. The only issue I held with the movie was the villain of the movie (IOI headed by a pretty typical protagonist). Other than that, the movie had me very engaged, and thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Given some time, I could probably come up with other plot holes and issues, like Ogg not already knowing how many references there were to his late wife in the archives, the villain giving away his plan to blow up Wade's house. Not to mention he hires a dude to do a job and blatantly tries to ruin his Bounty Hunter's plan. Either way, this movie gets a 5/5* stars from me and that's because the ending was absolutely perfect, and It truly gave a new feeling to what felt like a ride through a new world's Willy Wonka, with just as good of an ending with a message that should reach a digital audience on a personal level. *would give it 4/5, but I feel it deserves more than a simple 80% for an audience score. As I type this it was at 80%."
"55",4.5,"  I just saw 'Ready Player One' in IMAX 3D, and as of right now this is by far my favorite Sci-fi movie of all time! I love the visuals/animation, the sound was awesome, and this was certainly an Easter Egg hunt for me. Overall, I give this film a 9/10."
"56",4.5,"  A few significant departures from the book were taken in translating this story to the silver screen but overall it was done well and while the weakest link in my opinion in the movie are the two lead ""evil"" characters the rest of the screenplay tracked well to make for a fun and sweet movie with a wonderfully nostalgic soundtrack."
"57",5,"  This movie is a nostalgic blast from beginning to end. Needs to be seen on a big screen and more than one time to catch all the references.Not gonna spoil anything, needless to say you will not be disappointed!"
"58",0.5,"  Not the kind of crap expected from spillberg. Dissapointed."
"59",5,"  liked, it, love the story, like the way the character find out the problems, got a little not good at climax but the ending was smooth and great. love the drama and I hope there's sequel. May be this film like anime ""Sword Art Online"" which have another story but need more different and more exiting than first film."
"60",5,"  Amazing! rotten tomatoes dont know what there talking about giving it such a low score"
"61",0.5,"  Not the kind of crap expected from spillberg. Dissapointed."
"62",5,"  liked, it, love the story, like the way the character find out the problems, got a little not good at climax but the ending was smooth and great. love the drama and I hope there's sequel. May be this film like anime ""Sword Art Online"" which have another story but need more different and more exiting than first film."
"63",5,"  Amazing! rotten tomatoes dont know what there talking about giving it such a low score"
"64",4.5,"  Steven Spielberg has given us some cinematic gems of all time and this one is no different, this one is an instant classic and one I will be watching for a long time"
"65",5,"  This movie is just absolutely stunning. It's like watching 2 movies at once with the shining part. This movie is also filled to the brim with Easter eggs so that you can try and spot them out."
"66",4.5,"  Ready Player One was a movie I didn't really have high hopes for, but was I pleasantly surprised. Spielberg was able to combine pop culture references and dozens of movies and games to create a fun movie to please the nerd inside of us."
"67",4.5,"  Loved the film, Great storyline and characters. As a gamer since the age of 7 I saw a lot of easter eggs in the film and loved how they managed to get them put in there. Also some true stories from gaming history."
"68",1.5,"  Only followed the Plot summary of the book. Left out so much detail and information that made the book so awesome. Redbox at best. Not worth a trip to the theatre."
"69",4,"  Since the dawn of the Atari age man has searched for a decent video game movie. But in all those years there has only been one success, which succeeded because it was about video games rather than based on one. And now Steven Spielberg has built on that formula to create a true classis for the gamer generation.The first thing that strikes you is that this is an absolutely gorgeous movie. Avatar or Valerian level gorgeous. The character designs, worlds, and massive battles within the Oasis are well beyond anything that could be produced in the real world, and that's the point. Even non-gamers will understand the allure of spending your time and money in a place as wonderous and boundless as this. From a technical standpoint, the motion capture is state of the art and the textures and particle effects luscious. I wish the graphics on my PC could be this good.The pacing is fast and lean, and the action scenes breathtaking. There are shootouts, jaw dropping race sequences, and beautifully choreographed fight scenes- some of which spill over into the real world. And the final battle on Planet Doom is beyond even Peter Jackson's best. It occurred to me more than once that this movie is like the ultimate Twitch stream, only without the creepy commenters or expectation of tipping.This is a movie that more driven by action than acting, but I especially liked Ben Mendelsohn as slimy gaming company CEO Nolan Sorrento. He exudes a palpable aura of arrogance and self-importance. He's ruthless, scheming, somewhat megalomaniacal, but above all deeply frustrated that these kids keep inconveniencing him by thwarting his evil schemes. Evil schemes that aren't that different from some of the industry's more abusive practices today. It's not very hard to imagine this guy as the head of EA, trying to bluff his way through a Q&A at E3.And of course, there are the Easter eggs. Enough eggs to fill hundreds of baskets, or whatever the digital equivalent is. Loot crates? Bags of holding? Whatever. The point is virtually every popular or cult movie, TV show, and video game of the last forty odd years is referenced, along with some much older. It would take dozens of viewings- or help from the internet- to spot them all. I know I haven't. What's particularly interesting is that many of them are plot relevant, because the story is about parsing subtle references to find the egg that will grant admin privileges for the OasisThe biggest criticism leveled at this movie is that it's rather shallow for a Spielberg production. Perhaps there's some truth to that. It certainly doesn't have the depth of Schindler's List, Munich, or even Jurassic Park. But then Jaws and Tintin weren't exactly cerebral either. And Player One does make for an interesting commentary on both the positive and negative social aspects of video games and the internet, even if it's not explored as fully as it could have been. And it's honestly quite refreshing that in a movie about virtual reality, the moral of the story is that you have to unplug and live in the real world some times.So Ready Player One isn't Spielberg's deepest movie, or his best. But it just might be his most fun."
"70",5,"  More then just a video game movie. Might have even forced gamers like myself to take a long hard look in the LCD screen."
"71",3.5,"  A fun bit of film making that will wisk you away for a couple of hours, and blast about a billion pop culture references by you at break-neck speed. It's not the book, but it keeps the tone and spirit."
"72",5,"  I went to go see this in imax and it kept me on the seat of my chair,I enjoyed how the movie was kept relevant to a path we may be going down ourselves. Also I would recommend this movie to anyone that would ask about it especially if you love video games."
"73",5,"  One of the best films I've seen in a while."
"74",5,"  I see a lot of movies. I am not a professional, I am just a geek. Having said that, I loved this movie. They managed to do a good job of mixing the virtual world with real world and making the danger be in both worlds. It was very well thought out. I was skeptical at first, I am not a fan of dystopian society movies, however it was very good. Of course it would be a Steven Spielberg movie. He only does good movies. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that he has made that wasn't good. He is just a great story teller. Very talented and seems to think outside the box. They say that Hollywood doesn't have any good ideas left. I think Steven still has a great deal to offer the world. This movie was awesome."
"75",4,"  Great film. Think I liked it more because I had no expectations for it but had a lot of fun watching it. 4/5"
"76",3,"  Read the book. The movie does a good job building the world and then quits before developing characters or plot. It also eschews the most trenchant cultural criticism. For what I assume are legal reasons, it narrows the worlds of characters it inserts, sticking with the Warner Brothers and Amblin properties. Other decisions shorten the story line, reduce the proportion of time spent in virtual reality, and make the movie acceptable to a wider audience. And others are probably a combination of all these. We're left with a team without the team-building, internal conflict without depth, and cultural criticism without much reflection. This is one of Spielberg's competent contributions, not a triumph."
"77",2,"  A beautifully boring ride.It was really interesting to look at and experience, and some of the cameos were exciting to see. But, none of the characters came across as real people, the love story felt very contrived, and the main character never had a crisis of faith in himself or internal conflict. He came across as overly capable for each situation and almost impossible to relate with."
"78",5,"  Best gaming and nostalgia movie ever!"
"79",2,"  A haphazardly reconstructed version of the book meant to be compressed not just for a film's length, but for a short attention span. Visually fun and light, but weak in adapting a film-ready book."
"80",5,"  best movie this year so far !"
"81",4,"  A normal story with fantastic visual impacts and cultural conferences."
"82",2.5,"  Watching this movie after reading the book left me with the feeling of being scammed. Sure the general plot was loosely the same but the characters were different and the competition was completely different. I felt like the screen writers based this movie off the cliff notes they read as this movie is not the same. Perhaps the kindest way I can describe it is that the movie was inspired by a conversation the writers had with someone they talked to who read the book. If I had not have read the book the movie would be a 4.5 out of 10 as the story was choppy and characters interactions felt forced. I'm not sure who dropped the ball but I think Spielberg lost his magic with the last Indiana Jones."
"83",5,"  So good! I felt 12 again."
"84",5,"  Spielberg isn't into making sequels and they way he adapted the book into this movie speaks volumes!...the movie is fun, a fresh journey and at all times it's an experience unlike other movies... Spielberg at his best. Loved the book and I Love Spielbergs adaptation."
"85",4,"  Spielberg manages to capture his magic again. Slick, faithful to the book and full of so many pop culture references it may warrant a second viewing. Eighties junkies will lap it up and its great to see so many different franchises mashed together. I really enjoyed it."
"86",5,"  Absolutely incredible !"
"87",4,"  If you expect a 1/1 of the book, save your time (if you have payed just a little attention you should know that has never been the plan)! But if you liked the universe Ernest Cline created and are in love with Spielberg's adventure movies PLEASE do not hesitate to see this! Is it a masterpiece? No... But I will guarantee you will be entertained. If not by the story, then by the breathtaking OASIS-universe! And I'm sorry but who the F*** can argue with a shitload of references from some of the most iconic and popular movies and games of all time?!One thing is for certain... I will go watch the movie again while it's in the cinema! And I NEVER see a movie twice until it goes on VHS/DVD/BRD/UHD. FIN"
"88",3,"  The CGI imaginary word of the Oasis is better realised than the 'real' world of 2047 but it's fun to spot the Easter Eggs from the word of films - although most are signposted rather than hidden. Popcorn."
"89",1.5,"  Boring formulaic hokey Spielberg crap. Just a lot of CG and loud noise with silly cliches and ""duh"" moments. A forgettable weekend movie for kids who don't live in the real world."
"90",3,"  Not a bad movie, but it definitely left much to be desired. I enjoyed the references however sometimes it seemed too forced. While it was a complete, okay movie, it wasn't fun,"
"91",4.5,"  While Stephen Spielberg's film adaption of Ready Player One does not reflect the book completely, it still holds true to the same backbone of the story. The film changed the way you could win the keys completely from the way it is done in the book, but this isn't likely to make it more understandable and less confusing to the general public. Even though this is going down as one of my favorite movies, it could of been split into multiple to better tell the story instead of cramming everything into a couple hours. I recommend you check out Ready Player One."
"92",5,"  Great Video Game Movie"
"93",4.5,"  Ready Player One is an extremely fun and action packed movie, but doesn't stop there. This action is combined well with a massive load of pop culture references, an intriguing story, and relatable characters. The story takes place in 2045 Columbus, where the world is grim. To escape this reality, people spent great portions of their time in the OASIS, a virtual reality world. The creator, James Halliday created a hidden game in which the avatars are to find three keys and the winner of this game would be granted the control of the OASIS. One of these avatars is Parzival, whose name is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) in the real world. He is the movies main protagonist and lives in one of the slum areas of Columbus. Wade too spends time in the OASIS to avoid the often harsh realities of his home life. The story follows Wade on his quest to find these keys, and he is joined alongside Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), a girl he meets in the OASIS and slowly develops feelings for her. These two have strong chemistry and are terrific leads in this film. Wade has a best friend too called Aech who also joins him on his adventures. There are other minor characters and allies too, who have interesting moments but are not fleshed out enough. There is an organization called Innovative Online Industries (IOI), led by Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) who want the keys in order to take control on the OASIS to give them more power and wealth in the real world. This premise works well throughout the film, as the stakes are felt both in the OASIS and in the real world. The visuals in this film are absolutely breathtaking, and Spielberg and his team have produced one of the best looking films in a long time. The music is also terrific, adding to the fun of the film and is part of the pop culture nostalgia. The references are very frequent, but they do not overwhelm the film, rather they add to it. Some of the references are minor and will be easier to spot on Blu-ray when the time comes, but there are many references that are important to the story. There is one reference to a movie in particular that is very integral to finding the second key and the characters spend significant time here. This sequence works well though and highlights how impressive the effects and story are in this film. The references vary from video games to movies to music from several decades, so there will be enough for every audience member to recognize no matter what age. The pacing is fairly good considering the 140 minute run time, with action sequences in every act. These scenes are the greatest elements of the film, the most notable being the final fight in the Third Act. The only major downfall of the film is the resolution of the IOI threat in really life. After many scenes of intense action, the resolution is very anticlimactic and disappointing. This part could have been written much better. Overall, Ready Player One is one of the most entertaining and greatest films of the year so far. The pop culture references are connectable and a lot of fun to see, the characters are very relatable, the leading acting performances are terrific, the story is intriguing, and the action sequences are some of the greatest bits of cinema Spielberg had produced. Steven Spieling has produced one of his greatest movies ever and once again proves he is the master of action and adventure!"
"94",4,"  Genre : Science fiction / FantasySpecies : Near finger tip SciFi. Computer generated graphics are getting to be awfully good.. I wouldn't be surprised if Art3mis is the catalyst for a serious punk fashion vein in the near future. Big bank, I'm in love with an Avitar, Lego like cinematics, don't push your luck with a bunch of sequels."
"95",3.5,"  Ready Player One is a fun film with tons of pop culture tidbits but only takes the characters names, the bare bones of the plot, and one location (the stacks) from the book. The book is not only better but has a different tone and message ....the movie has some deep seated nerd self loathing (that the book does not).....the puzzles are way easier in the movie ...the last time I saw such a dramatic shift in ""meaning"" from the book to the movie was the Natural."
"96",1,"  The worst book to film adaptation I have ever seen. Possibly one of the worst films not even considering there was source material. Honestly, I'd rather watch Batman v Superman. The film lacked any heart or emotional investment on the part of the audience or the characters. Constantly contradicting itself it fails to establish anything that the audience might care about outside of pop culture cameos. For a movie based on a book that was basically an ode to 80s pop culture, I don't know how they could have messed this up so badly. Not to mention this had the potential to have an amazing sound track. What we got was lack luster to say the least when you could even hear it. This shouldn't have been a difficult book to adapt to film, it practically wrote itself. Wish I could get my money and time back."
"97",5,"  Had all the tent polls of the plot from the book. Modified to fit the format of a movie."
"98",4,"  it was creative and fun. But a bit too long"

"102",4,"  it was creative and fun. But a bit too long"
"103",4,"  Great film with lots of easter eggs but it was pretty fun to follow all these references and be a part of this cultural phenomenon. The story is interesting and the cast was great."
"104",5,"  I cant even describe in words how amazing that was. Just go and watch it. I was literally sucked in. I hated the end because it kicked me back into reality. Epic movie."
"105",5,"  Oh GEEZ you guys... You honestly expect deep meaning from tis flik? It's about the box office revenue$$ ! Bottom line? Most all you naysayers had to purchase a ticket and THAT is the point. Spielberg took a popular book and bought it to the screen and... He did a damn fine job doing it! (made a ton-o-bucks in the process) THe visuals were stunning, the story line held together reasonably well, the characters transitioned between the virtual and real world beleiveably... I was entertained"
"106",5,"  Please keep in mind that the key target audience of this movie is roughly for people who are born between 1970 and 1980. Unfortunately if you are younger than this, even if you get the references you likely wouldn't appreciate them as much (please keep this in mind when you read reviews from other critics online). Regardless of your age thou, this is a very entertaining and well paced video game movie. If you like video games, you'll enjoy this movie. If you happen to be of the targeted age group, you'll love this movie! Nostalgia is a core element of this movie/story and it was handled very well when it got turned into the screenplay from the original novel. I cannot recommend this move Enough to anyone who loves video games!"
"107",4,"  As a person who read the book before watching the movie, i was kinda sad that the movie deviated from the book, whether it was small details, or major plot points. Good overall, though"
"108",4,"  A fun and visually entertaining film that leads the viewer through a fun and futuristic world. The storyline is simple and the characters fairly static but somehow that didn't make the movie any less entertaining. A real treat to see and a fun nostalgic picture."
"109",0.5,"  This movie is bad. Eragon bad. Milo and Otis bad. My blue heaven bad. I can't give a review of the whole movie because I left after the first hour, collected my money and went out for Thai food. I had to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
"110",4,"  it was an amazing movie but for fans of the book it sucked and it also lacks a real relationship with parzival and art3mis"
"111",1.5,"  More Spielberg schmalz. More Joseph Campbell zombie-sausage movie by-product:The 12 Stages of The Hero's JourneyOrdinary World. This is where the Hero's exists before his present story begins, oblivious of the adventures to come. ...Call To Adventure....Refusal Of The Call....Meeting The Mentor....Crossing The Threshold....Tests, Allies, Enemies....Approach To The Inmost Cave....Ordeal...Take your real-world wallet somewhere else."
"112",4,"  An intense nostalgia ride and a love letter to the pop culture of the past 40 years, this movie will keep you entertained from beginning to end."
"113",5,"  My family enjoyed watching it! Definitely going to buy the blu ray edition when it comes out!"
"114",4.5,"  One of this year's most highly anticipated movies is Ready Player One, the latest from Steven Spielberg. It's the big screen adaptation of Ernest Cline's beloved novel. There's as much riding on this film due to its fan base as there is with a new Star Wars or Marvel movie. In Columbus, Ohio in 2045, reality is a real bummer. The need to escape to a different world is paramount for so many people. The OASIS is a virtual reality world that provides an escape for people to get away from their desolate home life. Their homes are tiny trailers and vans stacked on top of each other, aka ""The Stacks"". Wade Watts (Sheridan) puts on his visor to morph into his avatar Parzival to carry out the majority of his day in the OASIS. As he says, you can be anyone you want to be and do whatever you want inside the OASIS. There are people he meets inside like Art3mis (Cooke) and Aech (Waithe) who are his best friends, yet he has never met them back in the real world.The man behind the OASIS is James Halliday (Rylance) whose recent death has the world in mourning. His final proclamation to his fans is the announcement of a new game. Buried deep within the Oasis are three keys all with clues leading to the golden Easter egg. Whoever finds the egg becomes the grand prize winner and inherits his stock and fortune from the Oasis. It's no easy feat, even for those staunch Halliday and Oasis aficionados. Five years pass by and no one has found the first key. Parzival uses everything he knows about '80s pop culture and the life of James Halliday and finds that copper key. His name appears on the leader board catapulting him to celebrity status. He's not the only one desperate to get his hands on the Easter egg. Ben Mendelsohn stars as the token villain, Nolan Sorrento. He's the head of an evil corporation named IOI (Innovative Online Industries). He sets out and orders his minions i-R0k (Miller) and F'Nale (John-Kamen) to kill Parzival whether it's in OASIS or in the real world.Director Steven Spielberg has made a love letter to his fans with this film. Watching it feels like he made it for me and the legions of other movie and video game geeks out there. It's stacked to the brim with pop culture references from all things Steven Spielberg, Stephen King, Atari, and other video games and songs that made up the 1980s. Try not to tap you toe along with its dance club-filled soundtrack. Author Ernest Cline was inspired by Spielberg's work, so it feels appropriate that only he could bring the book to life. Along for the ride is Spielberg's go-to cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski. Together they get the ball rolling with the opening race sequence. It encapsulates the exciting thrill ride that is the rest of the movie. It becomes a race for the audience to spot all the references thrown out in this one scene, including: the '66 Batmobile, the Back to the Future DeLorean, and King Kong, just to name a few. More importantly, this scene also showcases the stunning technical work at hand with how it all comes together.The film mixes live action, motion capture, and other CG tricks as it goes between real life in the Stacks versus what happens in the OASIS. They shot it using 35mm film giving it that grainy VHS quality as a nod to the times. This choice provides a greater contrast to the OASIS sequences. It's a visually stunning feat with seamless transitions. This shouldn't quite come as a surprise as this is what we love about Spielberg. He knows how to make any movie artistically sharp when you think back to how he created the shark in Jaws or how he revealed the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. It would be a shame not to recognize the special effects work come award season.The look of the film is obviously complex to pull off, yet the story is quite simple and effective. Part of it is the underdog David and Goliath story with Wade/Parzival going up against Sorrento. It's all set to a very Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory model hence the use of ""Pure Imagination"" in the film's trailer. Wade/Parzival is the Charlie Bucket looking to inherit Halliday's chocolate factory, the OASIS. Spielberg reminds us that this is more than just a silly video game movie. There are shots along the way where the humans are in battle and we see them interacting by themselves with their visors and gloves on. It's that growing trend we're facing with everyone buried in their phones without having a personal interaction with the person next to them. The character of Wade/Parzival asks the viewer to find their purpose in life, like he has, so there isn't always this instant urge to run off to a different reality as found in video games, movies, or television. It's a bit ironic coming from a movie where it idolizes the 1980s pop culture scene.It may be my adoration for all things Spielberg, but I found Ready Player One extremely accessible for non-gamers out there like myself. When reading the book, it's saturated in video game language where the movie feels open to a larger audience. Staunch lovers of the book will notice substantial differences, but it's worth keeping in mind that getting the rights to showcase certain references became an issue with bringing the movie to life. Author Ernest Cline co-wrote the screenplay with Zak Penn, so I trust his stamp of approval over the film.Spielberg has created another crowning achievement that's more than a nostalgic trip for those who grew up in the 1980s watching his movies. I would hope that the younger generation dazzles in the eye-popping storytelling much like I did when I saw Spielberg's early films as a kid. On a deeper level, I hope they take note of the diversity factor at hand when Wade and his High Five gang come together for the first time as humans as opposed to avatars. They're bound by a common goal regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity. Maybe, just maybe, they'll put their phones down long enough to talk about it in actual reality instead of the virtual reality of Snap Chat-ing about it.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? It's the vintage Spielberg we all know and love.RATING: 4.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS"
"115",1.5,"  Average story line with as many pop culture references as possible thrown in just for the sake of throwing them in. Story is rushed and there is a lot that doesn't make sense."
"116",2,"  Spielberg butchered the book."
"117",3,"  Not bad. Good one time watch"
"118",3.5,"  Terrific CG as is typical in this day in age. I am glad I decided on the 3D version. Consequently the visuals were quite immersive. However, the storyline especially the flow, tracking and bestowment of power among the possibility of three different entities possessing just one of the 3 keys was unclear and ultimately annoying."
"119",5,"  5/5 I don't usually like to give movies five stars but there was something about this one that just kept me smiling from start to finish. Maybe it was the video game plot or the endless Easter eggs, but I loved every minute of it. This is one that I will definitely be seeing again."
"120",1,"  You [ruined it and deviated from the book so much, it's never even the same story]! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!"
"121",4,"  An absolute fun movie to watch, with brilliant special effects and amazing digital worlds."
"122",4,"  thoroughly enjoyable. Not overly nostalgic. story is strong enough to carry the references. good performances."
"123",3,"  It's alright. Story could have been better but it's definitely an actual Spielberg movie compared to the Boring Oscar-Bait movies he has been making"
"124",5,"  This movies says a lot about where we are heading as a society, without having to say it. The story arch is thought provoking, layered, and goes beyond the typical ""place holder between action sequences""."
"125",4,"  I enjoyed this film. But it was almost more of a stand alone film set in the world that the book ""Ready Player One"" is set in. The visual special effects were solid. But the darkness that is present in the book did not show up in the film and I am not sure how it could have and still be PG13."
"126",5,"  great story very good acting tons of 80's material"
"127",4.5,"  lots of seex too mch!! to much of it!!!!!! lots of tomatos tho. tomatoes squirting everywhere,,,,, too much nudithjoy nutidty nudity and seex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
"128",5,"  This is so far my favorite movie of 2018 and one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved everything about it, and it instilled a sence of nostalgia while at the same time me hoping that the future of video games is half as amazing as the movie portrayed it. And in all it was just a cool movie, the nerd part of me was giddy with excitement at every turn. Though I do recognize that it has flaws, and that a channel like cinema cins might have an easy time coming up with faults at times, it's still an amazing movie and I encourage anyone, not just gamers, to watch thus movie."
"129",2.5,"  Basically it's just eXistenZ for kids."
"130",5,"  Amazing. Everything you could ever want in a movie!!!"
"131",4,"  If you're expecting a book to screen translation, you will be disappointed. There is maybe 30% of the book in the movie. That said, if you are looking for good escapism fun, this hits the spot!I liked the book and the movie, though it is fair to say that a LOT of the book never came close to making it onto the screen. The cast is solid enough, even if most don't resemble the book's descriptions, H is the only character that (I felt) was spot on.The ""movie game"" scenes in the book were really cool, they kind of made one in the movie, only totally different, but also cool in its own way.So again, if you're a die-hard fan of the book - you will whine and complain like some of my friends, but if you can step away from your preconceptions, you just might realize you had one helleva ride."
"132",5,"  masterpiece Steven Spielberg"
"133",3.5,"  I enjoyed it. Fast-paced and full of 80's and 90's pop culture references. The action hardly ever lets up and the 2 and a half hours runtime flies by. I saw it in IMAX 3D and definitely recommend it in that format as well."
"134",5,"  On my side I really loved it, perfect amount of humor and awesome references that everyone can really appreciate"
"135",3,"  Vomiting alert !!?? Vomiting alert!! ?? A heads up for everyone who wants to go watch the movie: DO NOT GO TO THIS RIGHT AFTER EATING A BIG MEAL ! I personally love the IMAX 3D effects! And I do understand you need certain amount of it to make viewers a bit dizzy, as a bit of show off of the technology and cinematography. Normally is only about 5 to 10 minutes. But this is movie will make you feel nauseous for OVER AN HOUR! And I am not kidding, especially after my big breakfast, when I put on that IMAX 3D glasses I almost vomited in the theater. I have to intermittently take the glasses off, and watch the movie with my naked eye in a IMAX 3D screen. Not fun !! And very difficult to enjoy the movie. Okay, back to the movie review. I do have give credit to the writing of this film. The story take place in 2045, in very near future with just a bit more technology advancement than right now. Apparently, the VR games are gonna be the future! Every thing in the game world is just as what we expected: fast, thrilling and very realistic. There are many characters and very detailed storyline, kudos for the writer to compress a lot of the content and stories in just 2 hours. The mission of writing is maybe too big of a bite to chew on it. Towards the last 1/4 of the movie, it's twist after twists, flip after flips. Every scene is either about the good guy is on top, then 3 mins later the bad guy, then the good guy in on top again, and the bad guy is over powering, then flip again, again, again, and over again..... It's a bit difficult to follow the story or be submerged in that world, because when you just realized how the storyline and trying to go into the movie, you got pushed out immediately by the next scene! Halliday's life, which is the basically the history of video games. Make me really reminiscing with all the games that I grow up with, especially the arcade game characters. Skipping school, and lying to my parents about studying in the library, just to play the arcade games or friend's new Nintendo. Not a good example for kids, but I guess we all been there. Tempo of the movie is very fast, in fact that the whole movie never slowed down. Normally fans like that, but with even faster, drowsy 3D screen, everything is too much to an extreme. And the extreme fast tempo and extreme fast graphics are making each scene seems very choppy. There is rarely one shot to from the beginning to the end. A lot of 3D graphic creations that I really would like to watch it closely, to appreciate how difficult and detailed it was made by these first class artist. Of course, everything only had about 1 second of screen time, you hardly can see anything clearly. Seems like it needs a lot of editing to slow it down for audiences to really feel the level of the awesomeness in the 3D graphic illustration and graphics. Another thing about the tempo is the speed of dialogue. Obviously Kaiden and Sho, these two characters are speaking English as 2nd language. But they seems like is exchanging conversation with people in their 20s and 30s in their first language. This is not very realistic! If you have had experience of learning and speaking other language, you would realized that you process everything much slower than the first language speakers. Because the brain needs time to process and put the words together, and sometimes they are not necessarily grammatically correct. Over I have more issues with the tempo than anything else. It started really fast, stayed really fast, and ended fast. When there is not contrast of slow and fast, it just make the whole movie seems very flat!!Special effects and sounds effects are definitely top-notch. You can see the movie makers are desperately trying to showcase all they got. And it shows! It's like spice-packed Indian food: cumin, curry, carrot, onion.... etc, everything that's good, why don't we throw it in the pot, then pressure cook it. What you get after is just a pot of delicious texture-less BLAH! In the movie you definitely all the characters from the history of video games. When I say all, I meant ALL! There are all the SNK's street fighter, ex. Chun-Li and kyo. Capcom's fighters in FULL REUNION. Hello Kitty and ALL her friends!!!! Not sure what are they doing there, why there are there. And mostly importantly, they are not related to any part of the storyline. So why they are all there? Not sure ?? In terms of acting, it's a easy job. Most the time the actors had VR goggles on. As major of the movie takes place in the VR game, very little reality was featured in the movie. However there are. Especially when it's Halliday's line of story. It's mostly real person acted out, wonder why Halliday didn't have an avatar, and really wonder why how come Halliday wasn't a character in the game. I feel like his line of story can be better developed, or maybe explain it better in the sequel ready player 2. ?? Last but not lease is the theme: ""Reality is real."" This line has repeatedly come out from the very beginning of the movie to the very end. Therefore it's very nature for me to assume that it's the theme of the movie. Every time this line appears, it did not hit me, like why it's important and how it become this important. Each time when this theme-line came out, it didn't create an ah-ha moment. I know reality is real, because when you die, you disappear in reality with your avatar in the game. Every time this line come out, the value of reality really did not elevate in my mind. Maybe because I was so nauseous by 20 minutes in the movie til the end. It really lack of a lot of development why reality is so real to us, maybe because there is only one reality? So you should make it count!"
"136",1.5,"  This is the same guy that made ET and Jurassic Park?!? If you liked the book at all, be warned that the only thing they have in common is the character names (and thats not even completely true). Other then that the book and movie have nothing in common. With that said the movie on its own is terrible. Let me correct that, if you absolutely love popcorn movies, have no concern for plot or a good characters then you might like this. Wade does absolutely nothing in the movie, the cast of characters around him pretty much do it all and jesus is he so blah. Parts of the book that are well explained because they are important to the story are just skipped over in a 2second voice over. There is no real explanation about what or why things are happening but hey I just say chuckie and a ninja turtle so who cares! As a product of the 80's, I felt that nostalgia as well but a Delorean and t rex only work if the movie is actually interesting. Spielberg did this movie probably because he only had to shoot a couple days of actual live acton and the rest is CGI. If you thought Jurassic World was great, go see this."
"137",5,"  I loved this movie. The plot was interesting and the characters were funny. I loved all the pop-culture references and easter eggs. This movie showcase a lot of what I, and many others, love about video games while also acknowledging that we need to maintain our grip on reality. I know that this movie is highly unlikely to get a sequel, but I would be happy to see one made."
"138",4.5,"  While offering an amazing visual entertainment, Ready Player One has it almost all right, with a well-organized story, classic movies details and getting the audience into this hi-probably future of the world. Not a perfect score as the actors could be better. Mention good performances from Simon Pegg and Ben Mendelsohn."
"139",5,"  I read the book before going to see this movie, which in my opinion. I think everyone should do before they see this film. I absolutely LOVED this film!! It had everything i loved about the 1980s and everything of today's movies. It was a perfect thrill ride that EVERYONE needs to see!!!!"
"140",5,"  Really good movie ! Every gamer's dream !"
"141",1,"  I am shocked Cline let them make so many changes from the book! They sliced, diced, chopped, and then added a ton of original material that it lost the total charisma of the story. Cline should of taken advise from JK Rowling on how to bring the pages to the screen. When it says ""Based on the Book"" - they aren't kidding, it is very loosely based. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend you do! Or listen to it on audio - Will Wheaton does an excellent job!"
"142",4,"  I thought it was a good show would watch it again"
"143",2.5,"  Just okay as a movie, but I came away thinking what a waste of resources it was. Didn't read the book, but seeing the moving it was clear that a lot was left out, such big holes that were vital to the real plot. What is left is little more than a video game with a boy meets girl story. No laughs. No lines or plot worth remembering. No philosophy. The world itself makes no sense. The way people act, especially toward a man with a gun at the end as so unrealistic that it takes you out of the movie entirely. People say this is a throwback to young Spielberg, but young Spielberg was all heart and soul. Now he is all politics and political correctness. Movie has wonderfully diverse characters without any character at all. In Director's cut, gun at the end will be replaced with a walkie-talkie and it will be praised as a surrealistic masterpiece. Oh, yeas, saw in 3D XD, really crappy visuals and sound. Seen foreign movies that do 3D so much better."
"144",5,"  Ready Player One was a fantastic thrill ride of nostalgia. The entire film was packed full of pop culture Easter eggs. While the main heroes searched for their own Easter eggs, we the audience got to search along with them for both the real world Easter eggs as well as the fictional ones. The film was different from the book but any true Ready Player One fan should see that the movie just gives us more content to enjoy. Not only in the movie, but in our real world we get all the artwork, merchandise, collectables, etc. I'm super excited for all the collectables to come from this movie. Our characters now have faces instead of what we imagined the look like. The book was amazing. The movie is also amazing. I personally will be re-watching the movie probably as many times as I read the book, which was 4 times. The only things I didn't like from the movie were that they didn't bring to life Ludus on screen for everyone to see. I really wanted the world to see what a virtual school would look like. Oh well though. If you loved the book, don't complain about the movie giving us extra content to enjoy."
"145",5,"  This is a must-watch film! ??"
"146",5,"  The film was just overwhelming and the special effects are amazing!"
"147",3,"  Not faithful to the book at all, but visually appealing. Many of my favorite scenes from the book were not included. I also felt like the movie was aged down and a bit too cheesy. Pretty bummed as it is my favorite book that I've read in the past 10 years. I'll give it another try to see if I can get rid of this taste in my mouth."
"148",4,"  Only four stars because overall the movie was great, but as a collective I can respect that it wasn't the best movie ever. However, the special effects, storytelling and character portrayal, and pure nostalgia BOMB made this an excellent movie.Would see again at theater prices."
"149",1.5,"  Quite unnecessary. Once again, pandering to nostalgia culture and pushing the VR tech to be normalised narrative - and that's about it."
"150",3.5,"  I made the mistake of reading the book first.....just wasn't as good. Many of the themes are lost in this movie and makes me wonder if Spielberg or the screenplay writer actually read it....or better yet...understood it"
"151",2.5,"  [Spoilers ahead]Addressing a challenging and important idea - of humanity being ""consumed"" by social networks - Ready Player One falls short. It seems like all dialogues occur between children in the kindergarten and the main antagonist is just a bully from another neighborhood. Memories recorded by Halliday tell about childish quarrels rather than bring up philosophical message of making (inevitable) mistakes and being sorry for them a whole life. In just a matter of minutes heroes change sides, fall on love, loose family members, but it is not a problem for them to continue playing an extremely boring world of the OASIS. It is hard to grasp any idea or message of Ready Player One - except that total domination of VR social networks which leads to people loosing real money, health and their lives is actually fine. The only thing which is needed to be done by ""good"" protagonists is to establish two ""days-off"" from the game per week.One may enjoy both obvious and hidden links to other movies and games, but that's everything that Ready Player One has to offer."
"152",5,"  Gundam is very very cool?The Sinning is funny?I love Steven Spielberg???"
"153",2.5,"  Okay, not bad, i didn't like the avatar though. I really am hoping this is not the future of the earth because it's really depressing :( Makes me miss my Sega and Nintendo DS :( But we're all confused about the end of the game where the players weren't in the game anymore,they're in some kind of room from the maker's (Halliday) childhood..? It doesn't make any sense :("
"154",3.5,"  A strikingly visual film that needed more depth on some of its themes"
"155",4,"  What a great movie! With jaw-dropping visual effects, it explores the infinitely interesting and overwhelming possibilities of virtual reality and the future of video games, without forgetting to reflect on the eventual perils that might come with it, reminding us that, ultimately, reality is what really matters."
"156",2.5,"  Ready Player One may have impressive visuals and a nice plot, however these barely make up for the awkward and often cringeworthy character interactions. Art3mis and parzival bring an increased amount of frustration. A lack of chemistry between the actors was somewhat obvious. I loved the book, with it's endless 80's references and amazing characters, however Spielberg's rendition did not live up to the source material. Unlikely to recommend."
"157",5,"  I saw it this past weekend with my nephews, we all loved it."
"158",4.5,"  Was great family film"
"159",2.5,"  There's computer games within games, every character you've ever seen and probably hundreds of additional character references you won't get even if you see them in the visual blur.It's mostly harmless."
"160",0.5,"  Many good movies with low ratings and this piece of shit with this high rating?? Come on! You understand movies stuff like my grandmother understand football!"
"161",4.5,"  Seen it. Love it. Recommend it. A great movie with not well known list of actors, who did a GREAT job performing. Visuals are just incredible. Steven Spielberg did an awesome job with the book adaptation. Recommend to watch it."
"162",5,"  Stop comparing books to movies! This movie was entertaining, looked beautiful and was awesome with the references."
"163",3,"  Uncharismatic lead, incoherent plot, lots of visual noise. Some fun character moments and storytelling ideas."
"164",4.5,"  Its a very exhilarating movie!! watch it in 3D!!!!!"
"165",5,"  Best ""player"" movies"
"166",5,"  My new favorite movie of all time!! Previously held by Jurassic Park 1993, 25 years ago! I love Stephen Spielberg, and this movie completely rekindled that relationship."
"167",3.5,"  Ready Player One was funnier and more fun than it had any right to be. I'm not in love with it but I had fun.I wasn't amazed and thought it had some problems. But considering I had zero expectations I thought it was fine.There are some pacing issues with some of the action scenes going on for too long, or some of the internal logic not really making any sense. But on the other hand some of the jokes about soul less corporation monetization of everything were pretty funny. So it does kind of balance out.Don't expect something deep and you'll be pleasantly surprised where the movie takes you.Overall there are worse ways to spend near 3 hours on a movie."
"168",5,"  sólo dirÃ© una frase que describe la pelÃ­cula (estÃ¡ pelÃ­cula es mas que solo referencias"
"169",2,"  Be prepared for this film to be nothing like the book. It appears Spielberg pulled what he thought would be the flashiest moments in a misguided attempt to appease fans but left out all of the character building, nuance and intelligent problem solving that made the book so engrossing. Just another film in the Michael Bay-ification of our movie culture. Where Parzival uses his mind to overcome his limited resources we get instead challenges that are the biggest mess of explosions and random cultural references I've ever seen. This is all apart from the terrible, hole filled plot that sees interesting, complex characters devolved into hollow caricatures plucked right out of a generic movie handbook. The second half of the film is arguably one of the worst messes of a movie I've seen. It almost seemed like Spielberg was trying to make a parody of what a Spielberg movie is. As a fan of the book, I was angry. As a fan of movies, I was disappointed. Second star was for the stellar cgi."
"170",4.5,"  Encapsulating almost everything we know and love about the 70's to the 90's, Ready Player One brings along a whole new ""level"" of visual beauty, suitable humor, and a feast of references that once again proves Spielberg is in control of his immaculate and breath-taking creations!"
"171",1.5,"  Compared to the book: wrong. I kept asking aloud, ""what movie is this?!"" because so much about the characters and plot were blatantly wrong. Not just little things either.. Huge plot points/characters/significant details and events from the book are either twisted or missing, with a lot of unnecessary things added. As a stand-alone movie: CGI train wreck. The ""plot"" they shuffled together is all over the place and feels rushed with gratuitous nostalgia sprinkled liberally (because that's what those stupid nerds want, amirite?). I'll probably see it one more time just to try and see it for what it is without being blinded by rage, but I'm going to use my Moviepass so I'm not actually wasting money this time (I saw it in Imax). Keep in mind I'm no critic or know a lot about movies, so all I can say is that nearly everything I loved about the book is missing from this film."
"172",0.5,"  They destroyed the story, narrative and characters, the book was perfect, now it feels like The Scooby Gang of Token Characters VS The Dinosaur-Busyness-Man from planet Evilcorp."
"173",2.5,"  Sadly, this was the movie the book deserved, even though it was completely different than what the book warranted."
"174",5,"  I loved this film. There was never a dull moment with twists around every corner. All of the actors have great chemistry and it matches up well to the book."
"175",4,"  Really enjoyed the book and the movie was so much fun, I didn't mind all the changes in the slightest."
"176",1,"  If you are book reader DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It is NOTHING like the book!"
"177",4.5,"  As someone who hasn't read the book nor heard much about it other than a short teaser preview, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the film! My kids (ages 14 and 11) loved it as well. I enjoyed all the nerdy old school references offered up throughout the film. I'm giving it 4.5 stars because of the predictability factor, but I didn't mind that so much. It was a good couple of hours to spend away from our reality regardless!"
"178",0.5,"  Its the most disapointing steave spealberg movie I have ever seen -10 stars"
"179",4.5,"  Genial pelicula, definitivamente vale la pena verla."
"180",4,"  Good story and characters. Also good for all ages due to the characters from different times. Though drags on a bit and Artemis's characters was introduced a little too quick...."
"181",2.5,"  It was an Ok . I assume a younger audience may appreciate it more than I did. Story was Ok. I did find a portion of it pretty boring but did appreciate the nostalgia mixed in. Skipped a lot of steps even for a longish movie. Almost fell into the ""video game"" movie advertisment genre that is so popular it seems. Visually pretty cool."
"182",2.5,"  Ready Player One was a fine movie but this is the young adult version of Stephen Speilberg films. Worth a watch all the same."
"183",5,"  Steven Spielberg's story, and countless easter? eggs. I could watch again!"
"184",2.5,"  Decent movie...i was not blown away by this mostly CGI film by spielberg, but it is still An okay movie."
"185",4.5,"  The trailer didn't do this movie justice. I really enjoyed it and the pop culture references made it even better for a gamer/ nerd like me."
"186",4.5,"  Ready Player One was an excellent movie that was intellectually and visually pleasing. The virtual world that Spielberg and his team creates is one of the best I have seen since Avatar. The movie was entertaining right from the beginning hitting audiences with a dose of nostalgia, action, and storytelling right from the get-go. The story-telling, however much based off of the book, was engaging and draws you in from the start. It avoided the normal tropes of these type of movies and was able to surprise and challenge the viewer. This may have been because of the cleverness of the book which benefitting the movie's plot as well. Although the acting was average and there were some continuity issues with the rules of the Oasis and how players interact with it, I believe these factors can be overlooked because of how much fun the movie is overall and how smart it is in other contexts. I am not sure how closely the movie follows the book but on its own, it is a great movie."
"187",4,"  Fun movie made better due to nostalgia and great easter egg placements; but still missing that oomph."
"188",4,"  I'm a big fan of the book. it's a must read! book was better then the movie, but only because of movie time constraints. I really hope an expanded version of the movie is released for home entertainment. Movie characters were better then book and some of the complicated logistics in the book were streamlined to make the story flow better. Overall, great movie, and great fun!"
"189",5,"  Absolutely amazing in every sense of the word."
"190",4,"  I was pretty worried about the movie adaptation. I loved the book even though it is more of a guilty pleasure than amazing writing. The movie was very good though, but no where near as many 80s references as I would have hoped. But, the changes that were made worked and there were only a few things that I wish would have been different. All told, good fun."
"191",4,"  Fun, action thrilled, Spielberg ride. Not over-drowned in nostalgia, but perfect and relevant to today."
"192",5,"  One of the best films I've ever seen"
"193",1.5,"  There were amazing graphics and the cgi was spectacular but the story line was all out of wack and how they portrayed the characters was terrible how H was a monster and Ard3mas didn't look anything like a real person was terrible. The part where Parzeval and Ard3mas meet before their encounter with the cocreator of the Oasis Ogdan Morrow was awful."
"194",4.5,"  I enjoyed the movie far more then I had anticipated. Great graphics and good characters but as always they portray a evil corporation as the bad guy"
"195",3.5,"  The story is pretty meh, but that seems to be purposely thrown aside for the absolutely stellar visual thrills, fun sense of exploring pop culture, and a believable vision of the future."
"196",3.5,"  The story is pretty meh, but that seems to be purposely thrown aside for the absolutely stellar visual thrills, fun sense of exploring pop culture, and a believable vision of the future."
"197",4.5,"  Definitely a movie for video game lovers!! Such a great thrill ride for sure and it keeps you hooked the entire way through. I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to see it again!! Go see Ready Player One!! You won't be disappointed. :)"
"198",4,"  A fun movie that is a must see for gamers and 80s stuff."
"199",4.5,"  Really fun movie that probably captures our future in an exciting and also believable way."
"200",4,"  ???????? ??? ???? true gamer , ???? ???? ?????????? ??? ???? ??????????"
"201",5,"  One of the greatest movies of pop culture even though they changed a bunch from the book still one of the best. So many easter eggs!"
"202",5,"  Fantastic spectacle. Another of Spielberg's finest. Thoroughly enjoyed it... both times!!"
"203",5,"  MY TEENS ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE ANIMATION, THE 80'S REFERENCES, THE FAST PACED ACTION, THE GAMING CHARACTERS, THE MYSTERY, AND OVER ALL VIBE! I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN AND ENJOYABLE!"
"204",4.5,"  4.5 Stars because the movie is 4.5/5 in the game and 0.5/5 in the real world. The real world parts aren't horrible but not as good as the rest of the movie.A must-see for every gamer (and movie/cartoon fan) in my mind."
"205",5,"  ??? ?????? ??????? ??? ??? pop culture, ??? ???????????? ??? ???? ? Spielberg ?????? ?? ???????????????."
"206",5,"  An excellent departure from reality, both IN the film, and for those of us watching. Ths inclusion of SO many pop icons old and new was phenomenal to see, and brought back Many fond memories.If the Oasis were real, I'd be a regular."
"207",5,"  This was the BEST movie ive ever seen in theaters. make a 2 movie!!!!!"
"208",5,"  Just came back from the cinema. I personally love the movie, as a gamer, I found A LOT of references. After the movie, I shaked from the excitement. Would recommend 10/10"
"209",5,"  A fun movie. A visual journey with decent story telling. sit back relax and turn off your brain!"
"210",5,"  Yes this is literally an Eaaster egg movie literally about Easter eggs chocked full of Easter eggs. It is really refreshing to bring back Spielberg's style of storytelling with today's graphics standards. Nothing is held back as far as nestalgia. The whole plot is about the life's missed opportunities of the lead programmer. Spielberg's best work since Jurassic Park."
"211",3.5,"  Ready Player One is freakin' awesome, but it's far from perfect. I recommend this movie to fans of any and all 80s movies, TV, or other pop culture, but there's definitely stuff in there that's gonna bug film fans like me.Obviously, as I mentioned, this film is awesome. The action scenes are exhilarating and fun, and they aren't even real, they're CG animated! Of course, this is a result of the talent of Steven Spielberg behind the... camera? Either way, Spielberg shows once again that he knows how to choreograph a stellar action scene, even without the use of music. While Alan Silvestri's score for this movie is phenomenal, the action scenes that use no music really impress. This movie keeps the energy and pace up, until the 3rd act that is. By then this movie gets a little sluggish and dull, and it's disappointing considering all the great scenes that come before. This movie nearly beats Wonder Woman for worst 3rd act of a great action movie ever. The first 10 or so minutes of this movie also rely on narration to explain what's going on, which is very lazy. Most people know the shtick before going in to this movie, and if not it's pretty easy to pick up, so it's annoying and lazy that the screenwriters chose to throw in a narration.Overall, though, Ready Player One is a lot of fun. Spielberg puts together an entertaining movie with fantastic action scenes. While the 3rd act is sluggish and the narration at the beginning is annoying, I was still (mostly) enjoying myself the entire time. If you love 80s movies, I can't recommend Ready Player One enough. While it's not without its' flaws, ready Player One is good, Spielbergian fun."
"212",5,"  This is the reason I love Steven Spielberg's Movies. The Nostalgia, the thrill, and the excitement in the film will have audience at the edge of their seats."
"213",1,"  this movie was boring. The characters sucked and were annoying, I did't know what was going on."
"214",2,"  In oversaturated market of that so called ""geek culture"", Ready Player One is not making it any better, by celebrating the fetishization of pop culture consumption and sacrificing the film itself (case and point: the dialogue in this movie, are the worst). And this is just another film on the forgettable summer movies list.However, i give it credit for their solid CG works. I mean... Warner can produce amazing CG for this movie but they failed miserably at Justice League, so that is a plus, i suppose.Also, i do lie if i say i did not enjoy the Mecha Godzilla scene, (even tho they fucked him up so badly)anyway 100/100 BEST MOVIE OF THE CENTURY GEEK NERD NERD GEEK HORAY"

"217",4.5,"  What a blast of fun !!!"
"218",5,"  Great Movie!!! I really enjoyed it."
"219",5,"  I have heard great reviews for this film and i have high hopes for it. LET'S SAVE THE OASIS!"
"220",4.5,"  It has been a long time since a work so visually spectacular"
"221",4,"  Too bad they cut some ""The shining"" scenes in QATAR but still enjoyed it. It's Spielberg."
"222",2,"  This movie is only slightly related to the book - same character names and a mutilation of the basic story outline. The book wasn't perfect and was tedious in its obsessive documentation of 1980s pop culture. However, it had story and plot elements that made up for that. Everything that was thoughtful and good about the story and the plot was removed or altered dramatically, and none of those changes were for the better. The movie version didn't even attempt to be logical or follow a coherant narrative path. The acting was painful to watch and seemed like it was geared towards 5 year olds and yet pointless extra sexuality was added to the story. This is a movie that caters to the lowest common denominator. Yes it has great special effects. It's a roller coast movie. If all you want is mindless visual effects, if you enjoy watching other people play video games, then this is a movie you might appreciate. If you expect film to be an experience for both the eyes AND the mind, you will be disappointed. If you liked the book, you will hate the movie."
"223",5,"  Awesome entertainment start to finish, visually aurally, great work Stephen,"
"224",3,"  For context, I am a major fan of the book, and was thoroughly excited to see this film. Based on the numerous trailers for this movie, I fully expected the story to be changed, but to enjoy a thrilling ride as Spielberg so often delivers. While I enjoyed watching the film, I was constantly met with frustration in the cinematography, and in just HOW MUCH the story was changed.I think if you go into this movie having not read the book, or with a full understanding that there is little to no similarity to the book's story, it will be far more enjoyable. This film is not bad by any means, but movie-to-book relationship aside, there were some major letdowns for me.The trailer seemed to promise some strong action scenes with a killer soundtrack to boot. However, this subject was honestly one major disappointment of the film for me. There was only one scene scored by an 80's hit. The song selection was spectacular - ""We're not gonna take it"" by Twisted Sister, but we got only about 5 words into the song when the foley completely drowned out the music. I'm not saying that things should be mute during a song such as this, but the audience literally could not hear the music at all over character dialogue and the surrounding scene's guns, explosions, etc. I do hope that others got a better experience during this particular scene, and that perhaps this was the fault of the theater's audio system, but the trailers we were given gave me the distinct impression of a very different tone to this movie.There were many other cinematic issues and plot holes that I was disappointed in, especially for a Spielberg film, but delving into those would be spoiler ridden. Baseline: Go see this movie, it is worth the watch, but try and put the book and the trailers for the film out of your mind. I would be willing to bet that this experience would be far better with such a frame of mind."
"225",2.5,"  Guilty Pleasure 2018"
"226",4.5,"  Smiled ear to ear through the whole movie with several laughing out loud in the theater moments. A fun thrill ride mixed with so much nostalgia. I had to see it twice just to see what I missed the first time. Don't think it is your cup of tea? A friend went to see it on a date but had no interested in it at all. She has now seen it twice and wants to see it again. You won't regret playing this game."
"227",5,"  Great movie with amazing nostalgic moments and references!!!!! Definitely see it on a big screen and if you're the 3D type see it in 3D on a big screen with loud sound!!!!! Amazing Movie!!!!"
"228",4,"  Rather than being a one-trick movie, READY PLAYER ONE utilises it's dazzling visuals to tell an entertaining, engrossing and, eventually, even touching story. Spielberg masterfully manages pop culture references, cheesiness, retro music, a decent main cast, perfectly casted secondary characters (namely Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg), mind-blowing action and an all around epic story without ever overindulging in any one ingredient.This might not be Spielberg's best work, but it's a wonderful showcase of great movie making.I saw this in IMAX 3D and would recommend the experience to fully enjoy the ride."
"229",4.5,"  awesome effects! pure fun!"
"230",4.5,"  I went to see this movie with some friends. We all agreed this movies was genuinely super fun and exciting. This had one of the best large scale fight scenes ive seen in a ling time. If you want to have a good time and like video games or movies this is the movie i would 100% recommend for you."
"231",4,"  It is a fun movie. it is able to retain the spirit of the book even if it substantially cuts down on the nostalgia and detail."
"232",5,"  The best movie for every gamer to watch."
"233",3.5,"  This is a moderately fun adventure movie... just don't expect anything more than surface-level entertainment. The film tells two concurrent stories - one in the fantasy world and one in the real world - and unfortunately, only one of those stories is interesting. After some lengthy (and somewhat clunky) voiceover narration establishes the setting (a future world where all of society is dominated by a virtual reality game called ""The Oasis""), the movie dives right in to the story that takes place within the game. This is where the movie really shines. It's wildly creative and the ""quest""-type storyline really appealed to the gamer in me. The first hour is almost entirely GCI, but it doesn't matter because the CGI is amazing and the virtual world is so detailed and immersive, it really feels like the best video game you ever played. I was all in. But the fun tapers off when the story moves into the real world and starts to draaaaaag. For a story about the dangers of becoming too disconnected from reality, it's so much more interesting when it's all about the fantasy world! I had become really invested in the characters' in-game avatars, but the characters IRL (that's ""in real life"" for you noobs) were totally flat and bored me to tears. The ""real world"" story is disappointingly trite - the typical ""good vs evil"" constructs on which the story is built are predictable and dull. All the heroes are poor little guys, and the villain is the embodiment of corporate greed (even the skilled Ben Mendelsohn as the Big Bad couldn't give that character any depth). I was praying for the film to find an excuse to go back into the virtual world - and it did eventually oblige me, but even then, it never recaptures the magic that made the first hour so cool. The overall story has a juvenile feel to it that targets kids, which is a bit of a paradox as a huge part of what makes this movie fun is the constant stream of 80's pop culture references. I fear that much of it will be lost on younger viewers who may not have seen those movies/shows... woe to the viewer who was born after 1990! But for Gen-Xers, it's a delight to identify the cornucopia of ""easter eggs"" (which are a major plot point of the story) planted all around this film... it would require many viewings to catch them all. Despite that, the movie is too long and the story was not consistently engaging enough to sustain my interest. By the end of the third act, nearly everything that had me invested in the story had slowly crumbled away, culminating in one of the lamest endings of all time. The movie is fancy and looks great, but it has no heart... and without that, it's just a fairly run-of-the-mill popcorn flick."
"234",3,"  On it's own - this movie is entertaining - compared to the book - it's poorly done. I went with the entertainment factor and treated it separately from the book."
"235",4.5,"  The Story is Mind Blowing,the Visual Effect is amazing and The Sound Editing is Great, Not the best Spielberg's Film,but still,this is one of the best film in 2018...."
"236",5,"  A fantastic world of it's own, Ready Player One takes us on a magical adventure through digital and analogue realities, and emphasising the importance to maintain the balance between the two in the real world. This movie is like a pure shot of excitement; the visuals are extremely fun, and the story is quite compelling. In terms of imagination and emotion, this movie has an impeccable Spielberg signature on it."
"237",4,"  If you haven't read the book yet that's fine, go see this then read the book. They can be enjoyed seperatly."
"238",4,"  Very fun movie and it looked amazing in IMAX 3D and the opening race and final scene really need to be seen on the big screen. For a 2 1/2 hour movie, it went by very fast and was a lot of fun. I had read the book but was expecting some pretty significant changes, most of which I was cool with. I wish though, that we got to see him fly an X-Wing!"
"239",5,"  Great movie, with excellent ideas, Spielberg really nailed this one!"
"240",5,"  Wille Wonka and Tron smashed together."
"241",3.5,"  Pretty good. Loved the shining scene. All the references were great. Halo veteran since original Halo: combat evolved. The ending was a little long. Simon Pegg as an old timer was pretty strange to see."
"242",5,"  I go to be entertained, and this did with a bang. Adding to the fun was identifying the 80's event to the movie event... loved the Terminator reference."
"243",1,"  For any fan of the book, a work deeply loved because of its specific cultural references and the characters interaction with them, this film will be a deep disappointment. It delivers on nearly none of the pay offs that occurred in the writing. The completely unnecessary added characters and entirely different challenges faced do not provide much enjoyment. Admittedly, a very difficult movie to make based on the immense amount of cultural references, but it would have been better if they gave up on this project in the planning stages. Very bad experience."
"244",1,"  Did Spielberg read the book at all? What about the stupid scene about racing? The one who plays video games always tries to go backward and see what will happen. So after the 5 years would probably someone already figure it out in the movie. Nothing like the book. The first gate should be in the dungeon that would be great to picture it. Also missing more of the 80's reference in the movie. Yeah, some parts were funny but I did not like it. If you did not read the book, you should definitely read it because it is pretty amazing, geeky book."

"246",5,"  Great movie, strays from the book and does not have the same character development. But great and have seen 3 times already."
"247",5,"  Amazing movie ?? loved it"
"248",4,"  A fast-paced action, adventure, sci-fi from Steven Spielberg. The action is stunning and the story has some interesting things to say about our modern obsession with online living as compensation for the reality of life which is not always pleasant. The self-conscious references to 80's pop culture is a bit annoying at times and some of the dialogue gets pretty cheesy. But, overall, an captivating movie that is full of energy, although it could have been a bit shorter. Possibly the best Spielberg entertainment we've seen for a while. Worth seeing in 3D if you have the opportunity."
"249",3,"  A truly movie tribute to the 80's culture with Back to the Future background. However, despite surfing in the wave of pop, the pace is at times too slow, straight line story and interaction between the casts is just too plain."
"250",4,"  A welcomed return for 'Popcorn' Spielberg, this adaptation of Ernest Cline's novel seems perfect for his sentiments, if not tailor-made to someone whose filmography defines the era in which this story pays loving homage to. Set in 2045, our hero, played by a likeable Tye Sheridan (and his conveniently located team of gamers which allows them to come together in a final showdown in the real world) has to hunt for 3 keys left in a Virtual Reality world called the OASIS on its creator's death in order to win the ultimate prize of a vast fortune and ownership of the OASIS itself. So far so Willy Wonka. Taking place in both a deliberately monochrome styled reality and a more vibrant and colourful virtual world overflowing with gaming, cinematic and other culturally iconic references, the film dexterously flips back and forth under Spielberg's masterly control. Films set in virtual reality have often looked awkward and unreal and since nobody enjoys watching someone else plays a videogame for 2 1/2 hours, this can be a very disengaging experience. Spielberg has no problem however making it convincing and exciting to watch right from the first VR race challenge to a surprising homage to a classic 80s film (which is different from the source material and not as on topic, but it is so much fun to watch, it'll be churlish to complain about the change) as he shows off a playfulness we have not seen for a while in his work. Despite a broad and none too menacing baddie played by Ben Mendelsohn, who feels regurgitated from his previous roles, this is a visually dazzling and very geeky rollercoaster ride of a film, that shows that the Spielberg who gave us Raiders, Goonies and E.T. should come out to play more often."
"251",4,"  Fun as fuck! In the best and worst ways"
"252",3.5,"  I liked this movie, but my wife did not. If you grew up playing any video games then you will like the movie, if you grew up in a cave and did not play video games you will find the movie boring."
"253",2,"  boring,stupid nothing in common with the book"
"254",2.5,"  The first half of the movie is non-stop action and fun, although a bit dizzying with 90% of it being CGI with the audience inside the virtual world of the Oasis. I never felt any connection to the protagonist nor was there any real suspense. I hated the fact that the movie glorifies virtual reality, so much so, that that is ALL the citizens of 2045 do - they live in the Oasis and other than a small throwaway line at the end - this isn't going to change regardless of our ""hero's"" triumph. Not a spoiler since it's clear from the beginning he will overcome the odds. Very disappointing and disturbing. I'd almost prefer armageddon to Spielburg's future in this movie."
"255",5,"  Unexpectedly fun and uplifting!"
"256",4,"  Loved this movie for the visual effects and punch lines but I wasn't so keen with the ''romance'' story or how it was portrayed. I thought it was a bit cheesy at the end and really not necessary."
"257",3.5,"  Is a good movie, SGI and animation is brilliant, the story is good all the way through till the end its gets a little silly, they should rewrote some stuff over but overall a good film"
"258",3.5,"  Doesn't always make sense and the CGI falls into the uncanny valley sometimes, but in classic Spielberg fashion, it's a dazzling, lighthearted adventure with great characters."
"259",5,"  Read the book and loved it, there was no way you could do the same story in two hours, it had to change, but the spirit of the book was there through and through, can't believe Spielberg pulled it off."
"260",5,"  Spielberg's Ready Player one is a delight to watch. A great adventure movie that is not ashamed to just be fun and also teach us a thing or two. I loved it. The book is one of my favorites and I'm happy that the adaptation was amazing. A must-watch for those who love games."
"261",5,"  So much Nostalgia feels during this feature. Too many Easter Eggs to mention and i'm sure I missed many more. They come in quotes, music and looking out for them. Great cast and story. Looking forward to reading the book version of this already. Loved the Shining reference and the CGI was fantastic. Highly recommended for a true Escape movie from everyday life. Added bonus is the main characters second name...Best Second name ever ;)."
"262",2.5,"  Wow, that was disappointing!"
"263",5,"  This is one film I would happily put in my video library, not just digitally but my physical library which only hold the best for me. This movie shows that even older generation members such as Speilberg can reach out and connect with the modern generation. He does so brilliantly with a movie about escapism, wanting to leave behind the troubles of the world for something better. But while this is prominent, it isn't what causes the issues, it's the tool used to save the world we live in. Just as Back to the Future has the deloreon, or the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz, they are but the tools which drives the plot forward. This movie uses something so abstract as escapism as such a tool, and it does it brilliantly. I personally would enjoy a place like the one shown in film, to participate and have fun within. It does it in a way which other escapism movies dont, and I love it. Also, the references to other media doesn't hinder the movie in the least, it's a love note to each and it leaves it at that. The characters are well done and acted as well, each one relatable and believable. Heck, I know people who match some of the characters in what they do and how they act. I cannot recommend any movie more than Ready Player One."
"264",4,"  Really enjoyed the movie. all the pop culture references and old school feels made for a good time. On a side note I did not read the book so i`m unsure how it compares on that front."
"265",5,"  Great movie, with a wonderful cast that did a pretty decent job. enjoyed it from start to finish. Props to Spielberg for creating this visual feast."
"266",5,"  One of the best sci-fi movie of this decade, another Spielberg classic"
"267",4,"  Way fun, some head scratching parts, still a hoot of a time"
"268",5,"  A truly classic Spielberg movie. It combines a passion for popular culture, with the drama and creativeness of an original storyline. With references to popular movies of times gone by, it makes watching the film even more fun. A lot happens, but things move quickly, allowing the story to flow with ease while keeping you guessing. A mixture of laughs, some sadness, empathy and excitement carry through the film, helping the story connect with the audience, and for us to get behind the main protagonist. It's a must watch, but make sure to watch every movie ever beforehand to get the real effect!"
"269",4,"  The real world segments feel flat - but who cares, we are all here to see the oasis, and in this the film deliveres"
"270",2,"  A trite, far too condensed, flaccid representation of one of my favorite books of the past decade. Laughed my way to the end. Not nearly high enough though."
"271",4,"  Children of the 80s, geeks and gamers and those who love pop culture will love it. A special effects hyperdrive but with a sad narrative for the future of humanity."
"272",3.5,"  It was kinda fun... nice being able to recognise the iconic references. Not a fan of the casting... or even how their avatar looks..."
"273",5,"  It was what Pixel tried to be ..."
"274",3,"  ""I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread."" Those words come courtesy of Bilbo (Ian Holm) in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. But they also illustrate perfectly why Ready Player One, while fun in parts and an overall success, doesn't quite capture the magic of its director's past blockbusters.That director is Stephen Spielberg, an ideal choice to spearhead a film celebrating every dimension and detail of late-twentieth-century pop culture. Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Back to the Future, Jurassic Park-these are just a few of the properties he has brought to the big screen. If each of them could look in from the past to see this newest creation, what would they say? One thing is undeniable: Ready Player One, whether the movie or Ernest Cline's bestselling novel on which it is based, stands as one of the most original entertainment entities of the new millennium. Its story occurs in the year 2045, with society having taken a less-than-utopian turn. Consequently, nearly everyone spends their time plugged into a virtual world known as the OASIS. Money, friends, fame, love-anything worth experiencing happens in there. Reality is for losers.Especially considering that the game's original designer, James Halliday (a brilliant Mark Rylance), planted a special egg deep within its digital walls. The first 'player' to find the egg gets half a trillion dollars and total control of the OASIS (which, essentially, amounts to world domination). The catch? The path to the egg consists exclusively of contests, quizzes and other tricky breadcrumbs based on Halliday's love for 80's movies, music and video games. Know the founder and you'll find the finish line.This is exactly what teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) intends to do. Thanks to his obsessive knowledge of Halliday, he (and thus, his OASIS avatar Parzival) have a great chance to succeed. He's also got a best friend (Aech), a new girl (Art3mis) and an arch nemesis (Nolan Sorrento, head of IOI, the sinister real-world corporation that also wants control of the OASIS).This is the short version, and still a lot to unpack. I don't want to be 'that guy,' but I did read the book before I saw the movie. For anyone else in the same boat, it should be noted that the movie departs from its source material on several fronts.Many adjustments are necessary and simply based on the medium. An early scene from the book involving a video game competition becomes a massive, exhilarating car race in the movie. The latter, of course, is much more suited to a visual experience, and the production's willingness to adapt should be applauded. Nor are the changes pure sacrilege, as Cline co-wrote the script. Each alteration echoes the author.But it also takes us back to Bilbo. For it's not just that a novel contains so much more information than a movie; it's that this particular novel is all about the information, the details. Ready Player One has characters, and a story, but cares more than anything about minutiae-the tidbits of cultural knowledge that only geeks and fanboys would know.The movie's intentions to highlight this are valiant, but misguided. Yes, we see the Iron Giant battle Mechagodzilla; we feel the eeriness of the Overlook Hotel; we hear the retro beats of Jump and We're Not Gonna Take It. But we don't fully experience any of them. There are just too many. The movie spends all its time simply reaching these coveted niches, there's none left to actually enjoy the visit.That doesn't mean, of course, that the journey can't be fun. For starters, Ready Player One might feature the most impressive use of CGI since Avatar. This is a movie that literally could not have been made twenty years ago. The story itself is well-paced, with likeable characters speeding through a fresh world of surprise and discovery.If you view the film as a series of nostalgic moments-Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Atari, The Millennium Falcon-it's hard to be disappointed. But if you're looking for those moments to add up to something-to become more than the sum of vintage parts-then you may have to resort to reading.There's a scene near the end of the film between two characters in a bedroom. It's simple, quiet; it breathes, it takes its time. Through the silence, and a touch of wonder, it leads us to emotion. Almost without knowing it, we feel like a kid again.I think this is the movie Spielberg really wanted to make. Sometimes the flash and bang and noise detract from the real entertainment. Here, it's the wonder of new worlds, and new friends. More than anything, that is the soul of Ready Player One."
"275",5,"  Epic amazing awesome made me feel 10!again"
"276",4,"  Visuals were amazingThe Plot was amazingly bad"
"277",0.5,"  So this movie is based on one of the best books ever. That being said this movie is a complete abortion. It is a blackened mark on the soul of humanity. So the characters, the story and the overall concept have been morphed, twisted and mutated from the original story. The story timeline butchered 3 mins into the movie. So if I could kick Spielberg in the junk, I would. You basically destroyed the whole spirit of the original story."
"278",1.5,"  Terrible writing, source material was not something worthwhile. Not worth paying to see."
"279",5,"  Amazing movie. Great cast that played their parts well. Would definitely recommend."
"280",1.5,"  Thought the book was sub=par going on maybe nostalgically entertaining? That is, if you get any of the 80's stuff. Wait till you see how the movie doesn't even manage that."
"281",4,"  A little jumbled and predictable at times. And it's definitely not book acurate (although most book adaptions aren't). The action is a little much too. Although it has its flaws, Ready Player One is endearing at its heart and definitely fun to watch."
"282",5,"  Fantastic - pure Spielberg wonderment great for all ages."
"283",4.5,"  It departs from the book a great deal, but is understandable since it is a movie, not a book. It keeps the same structure and theme, and overall, I really enjoyed it."
"284",0.5,"  Ready Player One force feeds you a meat loaf hodge podge of pop culture from the 1980s onward. Although the plot caught the gist of the book (collect three keys) the challenges that were chosen for the movie were underwhelming compared to those in the book. Character development is on a level with Sword Art Online i.e. There's more character development in bowl of pancake batter. Once again Hollywood fails to capture the essence of the book. Also: howmuch did Blizzard pay to have an Overwatch character in almost EVERY SCENE?"
"285",3,"  The movie was just ok, as a movie it was great but it wasn't as great as the book. They changed way to much compared to the book but in the same respect can't imagine anyone play Joust on the big screen."
"286",1.5,"  Shallow movie with a shallow plot and shallow use of IP's.The actors don't know how to deliver their lines without it sounding like exposition. The CG is creepy. The use of IP's leave a lot to be desired. And most of all is that movie just wants to shove that the author is a fan of the 80's down your throat.It's a waste of potential."
"287",2.5,"  Thoughts on Ready Player one. If you want to enjoy this movie then don't read the book. SPOILER ALERT. In the sense I spoil how closely they follow the novel.The novel was a love letter to 70s and 80s and 90s pop culture. The film was not.I was curious how many of the references and related challenges could be used due to possible copyright laws. I'm guessing none of them because almost none of the original references were used which means none of the original puzzles made it to the screen.I can understand that some things have to be cut to be crammed into a 2.5 hour flick but this was more like a complete rewrite. And the rewrites in my opinion were dumbed down echoes of the charming cleverness of the original. On a good note the graphics were great, some of the added bits were funny. Overall it felt like a gentle nod to the novel."
"288",4.5,"  This is a really good movie and worth watching. The alternative world was well portrayed and one of the best represented fictional movies I've seen in a long time."
"289",5,"  Unfortunately in India the movie has released in few circles. However it's a masterpiece from the great director. Visual magic. But I would request WB to increase the theatre release in India."
"290",4.5,"  It was a very good movie didnt see that coming. I will say this will be said to be some steaven spilburgs best work"
"291",5,"  Excellent movie very fun especially in 3D"
"292",4.5,"  Before I say anything, I would just like to say that I have not read the book, though I definitely plan to sit down with it sometime soon. Perhaps my knowledge of the book, or rather lack thereof, will allow my review of the film to be unbiased based on book/movie plotlines. I greatly enjoyed this movie; it reminded me of an 80's/modern day matrix. It appealed to those of us that grew up with 80's entertainment, along with current generations who rely on games like Overwatch and Halo for their connection. The movie had a good mixing of romance, comedy, thrill, and action that was a very nice escape from cheap movies being pumped out of Hollywood thus far.One thing I felt the movie lacked was a development of certain characters/sub plots. For example, I felt like 20 more minutes of bonding between characters in the real world, contemplating the chaotic society or developing the romantic subplot of our main protagonists could have made the audience feel more connected with the heros on the big screen.All in all, I really loved the movie. I felt like it got a lot of negative backlash coming out of the door, though satisfied that the profits amassed so far speak for itself. If you haven't seen this film I would highly recommend visiting the nearest theatre and treating your yourself to a visual and emotional treat!"
"293",4,"  I read the book first & loved it. While some of the plot & challenges are different from the book, it was well done, kept the spirit of the book, & the characters were properly done."
"294",3.5,"  Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" is a feast for the eyes and overwhelms the senses. That ends up being too much of a good thing since the film is too long and sometimes feels like just CGI crashing into your brain. Most of the film works well, though. The highlight is an extended trip through Stephen King's ""The Shining."""
"295",5,"  It was absolutely visually amazing. Lots of 80's nostalgia, which I am a fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was, it actually made you feel like you were in an actual Virtual Reality game."
"296",4,"  A fun ride loaded with recognizable references!"
"297",5,"  I absolutely loved this, packed as it is with dozens and dozens of off-handed references to pop culture trivia. It is pretty true to the book, though I did not get the same warm fuzzy feelings from the book. Would highly recommend the read, and the watch!"
"298",4.5,"  One of his most fun in years!"
"299",5,"  When was the last time you saw a movie that gave you an ear to ear smile for 2 hours and 20 minutes?Ready Player One is fun, heartfelt and provides a great journey for the viewer. The many references aren't too in your face and leave the viewer excited to spot them for themselves.A great movie for fans of pop culture and all things nerdy."
"300",5,"  One of the best syfy/virtual reality movie with the use of amazing cgi effects I have ever seen. So many references that you could probably go frame by frame and see hundreds of different video games and movies references it's outstanding. The story line and plot are well fitted for the time line it's placed. Somehow managed to fit in character development in such short time. I'm looking foward to another movie and to the year 2045"
"301",5,"  Sooooooooooo good!!!!! Filled with action and 80s references, and even though it doesn't follow the book super well I still love it!!"
"302",4,"  went to see it earlier today ahh gotta love it was bargain day at my theater. i really enjoyed this a lot of fun. loved easter eggs from pop culture. this made me feel like i was immersed in the virtual reality game, some parts made me chuckle. music was superb and oh the feel of a Spielberg movie the feels i tell you. i love the fact i was born in the 80's so i was an 80's and 90's kid i enjoyed using atari and super nintendo even sega. with my younger sister. of course movie references. i have never done virtual reality but i would love to try it. even the trailer music for this was awesome one of the best i have heard in years from other movies just so fit the movie. it is bit long but not that it bothered me. i am not done reading book but movie does deviate a bit so far i could see which it was supposed to and is a good thing keeping story but adding some originality. i went to see it by myself there were a few other people so like 7 in total but was weekday of course and 1st showtime of day. fun fact, though i wasn't gonna go miss half movie to go get 2 people in trouble but these two people together were vaping. like seriously i have seen people vape in wal mart first time seeing it in movie theater.i am glad to see most people have found the movie to be enjoyable. and got certified fresh that very good news."
"303",3,"  A satisfying gaming experience that brings the back to the future, and the future to the gamers."
"304",1,"  I was super excited to see this movie especially because rp1 is one of my favorite books. Steven Spielberg took something great and ruined it. That hack needs to retire"
"305",5,"  This movie was absolutely fantastic. Somehow this movie succeeded at being the best video game movie ever made, with out really being based on any video game. This is the movie gamers and nerds have been waiting for since Super Mario Bros. from the early 90's came out. It gets nerd culture and was made with the fans in mind. While people like my parents might not necessarily ""get it"" there are enough references to non game related pop culture and a story that follows a traditional narrative story that older viewers wont be left shaking their heads with nothing to enjoy. The shear amount of easter eggs, a concept previously foriegn to most non nerd non gamers is explained beautifully in this film. As for the easter eggs themselves, i found myself jumping for joy every 10 seconds with the characters and references I kept seeing and spotting. The relatively unknown cast does a great job, and I hope this film is the one that jump starts them to super stardom. This film is also a great introduction to the genre that is cyberspace with elements such as evil megacorperations that can commit any kind of unethical crime without consequence, cyberspace, and a team of heroes that ""stick it to the man"" and fight the evil corperations. While this movie is somewhat atypical to cyberpunk as it is a more idealistic cyberpunk story (with movies such as robocop or lawnmower man being more traditional pessimistic cyberpunk stories) this is in my opinion the best ""jumping on point"" intro to cyberpunk type movie. If you like comics, video games, the 1980's, this is the movie for you. this movie is both optimistic and an overall great feel good hollywood movie. I can't recommend this movie enough go see it. and i wont even try to list all of the cameos and easter eggs in this film. not because of how many there are (although they are in the triple digits) but because that would spoil how fun they are when they appear."
"306",4.5,"  Visually stunning, very well written and with such an immersive vision, Ready Player One is one of the best cinematic experiences ever created."
"307",4.5,"  Steve Spielberg proves he still has the touch with this film. While Star Wars The Last Jedi was one of the worst movies of the last few years, Ready Player One ranks as one of the best. Great story with great story telling and throw backs to beloved pop culture of the 80's and early 90's makes this one a real treasure."
"308",4.5,"  Wonderful movie expecially to gamers."
"309",5,"  Simplemente GENIAL!!!"
"310",4,"  A fun filled pop culture adventure."
"311",5,"  This movie is one super pop culture nerd orgasm."
"312",5,"  This movie is EPIC. It is a great movie that any age can see. I felt as if I was in a whole new world with this movie. There are very few times that I can feel myself in a movie, but with this one, I can. So many unexpected twists and turns. Love all of the imagination it has to offer!"
"313",2.5,"  I was NOT ready for Player One as depicted by Spielberg. I remember putting the book down with my heart still pumping and thinking to myself ""holy sh*t, that would be an EPIC movie"". Then the movie came out and I was quickly reminded that this is Hollywood and it wouldn't be an adaptation if somebody wouldn't F*** it up royally. There's only one explanation: someone just finished reading the book and summarized it to Spielberg while they were both drunk, then while still hung-over Spielberg made a movie out of it. Forgot the order of things, mistaken one character for another and forgot half the things that made the book great, so he made something up as he went to fill the gaps. That's the best description of this movie that anyone will give you. Because of all this it was pretty, but also pretty nonsensical and lost all the drama, tension, build-ups and pay-offs. Go home Spielberg, you're drunk."
"314",4,"  I liked the book better but I'm glad that it changed things up a bit. Biggest surprise for me was that Simon Pegg didn't have a greater role."
"315",2,"  Fun Spielberg - as opposed to serious Spielberg - features some combination of 1) excruciating tension 2) awesome set-piece scenes 3) great (character) actor bits 4) heart-tugging sentimentality. This one - though well-crafted state of the art, of course - has none of these. And on top of that, it supplies absolutely no evidence to support its ""real life is better"" bogus message. Gee, it's rough to have peaked before 30."
"316",5,"  The entire family enjoyed this movie. Is it the book, no, but I never try to compare the movie to the book, you only set yourself up for disappointment. This is the first film that kept the attention of my 4 children throughout the entire movie. Will see it again."
"317",5,"  Ready player one was fucking amazing. Anyone that's well versed in video games and pop culture will nut during this movie. I almost cried several times just because of how overwhelmingly awesome it is"
"318",5,"  Spielberg KILLED IT WITH THIS MOVIE. so much nostalgia and easter eggs. if you are in to movies,video games and VR then you will have a great time with this."
"319",0.5,"  Basic pure hearted teen male hero fighting the evil capitalism, falls in love with a ""cool"" girl, refuses to get corrupted by money, defends the American classic freedom value, saves the world. All that happening in a futuristic VR game."
"320",5,"  best movie I've seen in years, gotta see it in 3D now on a return visit"
"321",3.5,"  Ready Player One possède les mÃªmes problÃ¨mes structurels que deux de ses prÃ©dÃ©cesseurs centrÃ©s sur le namedropping pop culturel, Lego Batman et Wreck-It Ralph. En effet, le film de Steven Spielberg donne tout dans sa premiÃ¨re demi-heure et se transforme vite en une suite d'Ã©pisodes plus ou moins rÃ©ussis, visuellement rÃ©ussis mais finalement rÃ©pÃ©titifs et parfaitement oubliables. Certaines sautes de ton sont assez gÃªnantes et en dehors de Lena Waithe et Hannah John-Kamen, les acteurs ne sont pas Ã  leur meilleur niveau. En l'Ã©tat, Ready Player One n'est ni le plus grand film de l'annÃ©e ni une bouse infÃ¢me qu'on nous vend dans les mÃ©dias, juste un blockbuster acceptable et divertissant. C'est dÃ©jÃ  pas mal."
"322",5,"  Loved it! Wish I could live in the Oasis! C'mon technology! Get us here!!!"
"323",2.5,"  Read the book 3 times, and this movie is so boring in comparison. Everything is fast, including the plot. Movie lacks character devolpment and doesn't explain over half of itself (at one point they mention ludus, the world of schools in the book, but never showed nor mentioned it at all before then on the movie). I takes out interesting referances (supiadaman, ultraman [though ownership confusion was the meaning for that], many, many obscure arcade games, the interesting ending to the hunt [replaced with just playing atari]) for boring, common ones (the shining, overwatch, akira, iron giant). The ending felt uneventful and rushed, and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I will say the visuals (though sometimes in the uncanny valley) were interesting and fun. The out-of-bounds part of the race was fun, and the war at the end was fun to watch. TL;DR: Go read the book."
"324",4.5,"  In anyone else's hands, this would have been a disaster. Thank Master Windu that Ernest Cline handed over the directing duties to the rightful Steven Spielberg and took it upon himself to improve his own story. Not only does the result show us the right amount of nerdy, it also wows us with the wonderful way all these references are being implemented. Without them, the story still stands on its own and reminds us to have fun when playing. It's there for entertainment, as is this movie. Our main characters know that, and they truly embody that spirit of entertainment. More generations will be inspired to do more than just love what they're watching or playing, they might find new ways to enjoy it without having to be the very best. Log in and see for yourself."
"325",5,"  had so much fun watching it"
"326",5,"  Wow! #ReadyPlayerOne was like watching every one of my favorite movies growing up in one sitting."
"327",5,"  Best movie in 2018 so far. I would recommend it to anyone"
"328",5,"  Very exciting, amazing story with a good theme and very enjoyable to watch. A fresh new idea that will make you excited to watch it. I left the theatre feeling very satisfied and feeling like I had just walked into the theatre."
"329",0.5,"  Started out as a great nostalgia book targeting 35-45 year old North American men. Went through a book-to-movie re-write where they only changed the target audience, all the characters, the entire plot, and the moral of the story .... but hid this fact in the trailers and kept the title the same so that people who liked the book would still go see the movie. If you read and liked the book stay away from this film, it will only cause you pain."
"330",3.5,"  An enjoyable, glitzy homage to retrogaming. I was pleasantly surprised by a section of one of my favorite horror films in the middle of this which is worth the admission price alone. 3D was unnoticeable except for one scene,"
"331",5,"  I'm not into video games but I had a great time and flash backs to great games of the past."
"332",1.5,"  Honestly, it wasn't even visually appealing. It was just TOO MUCH for way too long (~2.5 hours). I feel like Spielberg was trying to make his Avatar here and fell totally flat in comparison. It's crazy to think that almost 10 years later, Avatar is still the most advanced and realistic film of this type (almost entirely animated). No one has come close to knocking Cameron off the throne.. Side note: I was appalled by the horribly campy and poorly executed Shining references. Making a mockery of one of the most terrifying and well-crafted films of all time is just embarrassing."
"333",4,"  A thrilling visual ride. Your typical ragtag team of teens somehow managing to do what no person in history has ever done before and battling angry corporate giants along the way, jam-packed with references to popular nerd culture. My friend and I were really tickled to spot Tracer from Overwatch not once but twice in the crowds. Some references went over even our heads, and the romance had us feeling we were watching a Twilight rerun, but overall it was a fun movie. Would watch again."
"334",5,"  Took the kids to see and we all loved it and my son wants a second part to the movie now"
"335",3,"  Removed al the nail biting suspense from the book and replaced it with more action sequences. Because that's want the modern movie-goer wants."
"336",5,"  Brilliant, Loved it in 3D"
"337",5,"  When i saw it with my friends, it was literaly one of the best movies we seen in a while, we kept having alot of laughing and easter eggs moments none stop while watching this movie. It was awesome, I cant wait for Ready Player Two, also be picking this up when it comes out on Bluray Day One."
"338",4,"  The film was good even though the book is better (well duh ??) they do improve some of the story in some parts, my only problems is it's too quick at some scenes and I can't believe I saying this I wish it was in two or three parts I hate they do that in films on one book but I feel it would have benefited the movie more and the real world back story is there but it's rushed but it's still a very good film and people should check it out"
"339",5,"  This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years. It has just enough pith to keep it from being complete fluff but that's not the point. Just the shared experience and delight of the audience that watches it with you as you recognize one throwback culture reference after another would be worth 4 stars."
"340",5,"  Just the kind of oldschool adventure movie you would expect from spielberg. a must watch for every geek."
"341",4,"  Fun movie, great for kids. Excalibur!!!"
"342",4,"  Very good but felt rushed. I'd have preferred them cover it in three movies."
"343",5,"  Loved the movie, I don't know why the critics are not liking it more. I'm definitely going to buy this one!"
"344",5,"  I read the book, and saw the movie with someone who hasn't and decided to compare notes on what we thought about it. Whole there were things that upset me that were changed, and stuff that felt left out to her (like it's not explained why Morrow and Halliday split in the movie, at all) we both came away really enjoying the movie and looking forward to seeing it again."
"345",4,"  I have read the book 2 times now, and i rather liked the movie. The plot is quite different and refreshing from the one in the book, but they still suffer from a poor love story. The cgi was great, and the shining part was easily my favorite part in the movie."
"346",5,"  the movie was great for me it had so many movie tv song and video game references and the characters were well developed and being 14 it was great nostalgia"
"347",5,"  This is a great movie, I like how the actors has to be part of the game. really enjoy the music in the movie as well. Can't wait for it to come out on blu-way"
"348",4,"  Loved it. Loved everything about it. Adventure? Excitement? An audience craves these things.And they get it in this movie! Unlike a certain recent cinematic travesty."
"349",2,"  The book is excellent, I've read it a few times. The film is terrible. Nothing like the book. I feel sorry for Ernest Cline having his mane attached to this."
"350",0.5,"  Poorly written. It seems like a bad joke. It also shits in the movie."
"351",5,"  One of the best movies ever made. Reason? Go watch it. Could be one the best movies of our generation."
"352",5,"  Absolutely fun to watch, story brilliantly laid out and told, awesome effects and nostalgic pop culture references. Do watch! ????????????"
"353",5,"  la mejor pelicula que he visto este año"
"354",2,"  I really wanted to enjoy this movie, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, this movie bored me, so much so, I found myself wondering when it would end just so I could leave."
"355",2.5,"  Anyone who has read the original book and loved it will most likely be disappointed by Spielberg's adaptation. The story has been altered so much that its now a shallow tale, full of plotholes low stakes and deprived of any meaningful emotion"
"356",3,"  In Ready Player One, though having lots of exposition, Steven Spielberg delivers a wonderfully thrilling first third, but soon afterwards fails to keep the pace and lets the story to gradually succumb to over-reliance on characters and plot twists that were common in 1980s but look sorely outdated and tedious in 2018. This as such is largely in purpose as the story wants to be seen as a tribute to pop-culture - for some reason meaning the 1980s' culture only - but it doesn't make boring the audience any less acceptable. The last real highlight is a magnificent scene in the Shining's hotel.The plot follows characters in the virtual reality and in the real world, jumping back and forth. Action involving the actual people is often poorly staged. Plot rushes from one place to another without much logic. Characters come and go as they please, and it is later difficult to remember what actually happened. The big end fight in the virtual world appears to be staged only because a big end fight needed to be at the end, having no logic, reason or real feeling and bringing nothing new to the long series of purposeless end fights in expensive blockbusters.Hit and miss, and increasingly a miss towards the end, Ready Player One is still a reliable Spielberg that probably will entertain younger audiences more than those who actually remember the 1980s."
"357",3,"  My 12 year old son and I each read the book. We both loved the book. It was an incredible page turner. A Great Story with many Plot lines and a few twists. The Movie does not do the book justice. The special effects were great. The movie missed the mark on certain elements of the book. Visually the book was much better."
"358",5,"  Steven Spielberg gives us an electric, exicting and visually stunning glimpse into the near future, breathing fresh life into videogame and Macguffin movies. This is Spielberg going back to doing the type of films we love him for - old-school Spielberg with non-stop action, fun and an exhaustive list of pop culture references that'll make repeated viewings a consistent delight."
"359",5,"  This movie is good and awesome"
"360",5,"  This film is 2h20 of a pure joyride from start to end. I was a little afraid to be underwhelm but it delivers on all front, even the 3D one!"
"361",5,"  This movie was incredible. I loved every minute."
"362",3,"  reality is the only real thing..Ready Player OneThe feature demands attention through highly configured rich details on visual asthetics which is admirable, for despite of having such a large range on the material the makers keep it clean (like coins are used instead of blood when someone is eliminated) and pleasing to the audience. But unfortunately the idea isn't intriguing enough to invest in it, in the first place for it seems like a compilation of different borrowed concepts that may look amazing but feels a bit eerie. Steven Speilberg saves the feature through his brilliant execution skills and projecting the anticipated vision on screen. On performance level, there isn't much range provided to the characters in the plot to express thoroughly but still Taylor Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are convincing and is supported by a great cast like Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg. Ready Player One takes its time in its first act and settles in perfectly before the second act kicks in where everything goes predictable but some throwbacks on old classic features (the quest for the second key is quite amusing) holds you on the seat only to mesmerize you in its third act where the plot enfolds in each phase with some brilliant action sequences and good old drama."
"363",4,"  Despite it being heavy on plot and may have one too many pop culture references, Spielberg certainly does deliver a visual treat."
"364",4.5,"  what a great movie this was"
"365",4,"  Really fun and good gamer movie!"
"366",0.5,"  Terrible adaptation of the book. Even if you aren't a fan of the book, there are so many plot holes, inconsistencies, and just plain stupidity in this flick that even fantastic CGI can't save it from the wastebin of mediocrity. Spielberg should be embarrassed and Cline should hang his head in shame."
"367",5,"  This is not just a film We wanted, this is a film that we need, summing up what it means to not only be a die-hard nerd, but also to back lash corporate that shadows against any culteral community!!! This is one of those films were I had to give my standing ovation. As i always say to myself, ""Geek, and proud""!!!"
"368",4.5,"  Ready Player One is the most interesting and creative movie to come out in 2018 so far. This is going to go into history with other Steven Spielberg films like E.T. and Jaws. The creativity of this film sparks new ideas and forgotten memories of times when I watched a movie and was blown away. The cast does a amazing job to bring the worlds of the Oasis and the real world together to create this believable performance. I cannot wait for another film like this to come onto the big screen and spark something inside of me."
"369",5,"  Movie was great. its different than the book, but almost all adaptations are. CGI was amazing, characters were great, funny. I'd go watch it a second time if I could."
"370",4.5,"  Quite enjoyable. Only cringe part was weak love story."
"371",5,"  Super unique and entertaining. One of my new favorites."
"372",5,"  (***No Spoilers) Ready Player One is a thrilling ride, a fantastic story layered with so many pop-culture references, with a sprinkling of Spielberg magic to bring this epic fantasy to life. A terrific balance of humour, emotion and for it's subject, a movie that reminds us to also spare some time for the real world. Simply brilliant!"
"373",4,"  I thought this was a good movie. Bunch of refferences and easter eggs that may be a little baffling to the uninitiated, but over all a well thought out plot smartly written villians and a good cast. Gie it a watch you wont be dissapointed"
"374",4,"  This is a terrific film to show the work of Steven Speilberg. Also a great way to show how technology is influencing us as a society. It would be a very interesting future but the underlying message for this film is a very human reality.My only issue was that perhaps it could of had a bit more to show of the oasis and the excitement from it. Its totaly an entertaining film, alot of fun!! But i felt towards the end it was a bit childish and soft. Something was missing i'm not sure what it was but overall its a great cinematic adventure showing Speilbergs talent!"
"375",2.5,"  If you are a fan of the original novel, prepare to be utterly disappointed, you probably won't like this movie interpretation. There is almost ZERO things in common between the novel and the screenplay. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but the things I was expecting or hoping to see never happened. And the challenges to obtain the three keys had ZERO in common with the novel, the process, the character development, the games, relationships...everything down to Wade's time as an indentured servant were completely opposite the novel. The effects were amazing, it was a fun movie all around.... Just don't expect to be able to follow along with the book by any stretch of the imagination. So may key elements were left out, so many interesting tidbits... Money not completely wasted, but it definitely left something to be desired if you enjoyed the novel. One thumb up, one thumb down."
"376",5,"  It is missing the first few chapters of the book but that makes sense once you see the movie. They completely changed gate 2, but also understandable. I loved this book and this movie is tremendous. This one is a must see. A whole lot of fun!"
"377",3.5,"  The movie was not a disappointment. Spielberg managed to once again pull of a successful and visually stunning film. The movie like any movie had its flaws but it was a delight and the positives outweighed all flaws. Although some of the references were pushed in your face such as the tracer reference which showed up 3 times. The classic bat mobile and Harley Quinn references were both subtle and perfect. Overall I really enjoyed the movie and give it a 8/10"
"378",4.5,"  Ready Player One was one of Spielberg's finest action/adventure films in a while, suited for most ages, action packed from start to finish with 100s of 80s pop culture references. This film created a nostalgic feel that I had not felt for a very long time, not since Tintin in 2011."
"379",2.5,"  It's a movie where you say ""that was neat"" then you go home and do laundry. The horror movie scene was the only interesting thing to me, other than that, it gave me a headache and I was waiting for it to end. This was not an 80's movie, there were 2 or 3 songs in the entire movie. Empty and fake emotional spielbergian corny ending."
"380",5,"  Ready Player One is a great film that takes you to another realm of pure imagination with mind blowing experience of Steven Spielberg's magic. It is an enjoyable movie and nostalgic at the same time. There is also a good message at the end of the film that really warms your heart. Everyone should see it!"
"381",4,"  Tenía las expectativas muy altas puestas en esta pelÃ­cula, y me ha dejado algo frÃ­o. QuizÃ¡s es porque hay pocas sorpresas respecto a lo visto en el trailer, aunque por otro lado cambia suficientes cosas del libro para no ser mÃ¡s de lo mismo. Lo malo es que las partes de acciÃ³n son tan alucinantes que saben a muy poco. AdemÃ¡s, hay tantas referencias a videojuegos, series, pelÃ­culas... que pasan en un suspiro y apenas puedes apreciar, y que hubiese molado que hubiesen tenido mÃ¡s protagonismo en la pelÃ­cula. Pero bueno, el veredicto final es que es una gran pelÃ­cula de fantasÃ­a, muy entretenida y bien hecha. Â¡Y ver al delorean de nuevo en acciÃ³n no tiene precio!"
"382",5,"  You have no power here critics... the audience loves this detailed project who is a tribute to the pop culture and a real work of love for many I said many fandoms... things and refferences that the critics from this page can get it.. your hate just shows how out of this society and world you are... you need an Oasis system ??"
"383",5,"  Best movie this year"
"384",4.5,"  I really liked the movie, almost to the point of saying I loved it! Spielberg definitely sprinkles his magic on this film!"
"385",5,"  One of the best film by Spielberg"
"386",3.5,"  I read the book, and was thoroughly excited to see the movie. The book spoke to me on a geek level I had never experienced before, and with the upcoming movie I was excited to see the various scenes play out on the big screen. Although the movie deviated from the book often, I still found it enjoyable. There were some scenes which I wished could have been included in the film, especially at the end, but did not come to pass. The ending could have been way more spectacular and relevant I think, but still it was an awesome movie, one I will be adding to my already monumental geek movie repertoire."
"387",3,"  The best thing about this movie is the astounding amount of easter eggs, but strip them away and you'll see that the king has no SUBSTANCE of its own. Also the 3rd act really dragged with me -- too much pathos, too boring, too generic. I wish I liked it more, but alas, alas. IT'S A CHEWING GUM THAT TASTES GOOD WHILE YOU CHEW IT, BUT LEAVES NO AFTERTASTE."
"388",5,"  This movie was amazing the graphics were crisp and beautiful . The story didn't follow a single genre in fact it was multiple genres , you had Thriller sequences, Sci fiction background , dystopian , utopian , and romance , also had excellent action sequences, it was also quite comedic. For all those who love 80s pop culture this movie is full of it along with 1990s and 2000s gaming references. The plot was very twisting with a lot of turns, but also had a lesson in the end that gripped the direction we are heading today in virtual reality, and the business side of it. Anyways I think these people who marked it down are really really harsh this movie was fantastic."
"389",5,"  LOVED IT!!! If you grew up in the 80's or 90's this is one of the greatest films in a while... FUN FUN FUN"
"390",0.5,"  Want to start this off by saying that the book is amazing. This film was entirely based on the relationship between the two main characters and missed the mark in terms of storyline and plot. The characters felt 2D and were not believable. Would not recommend anyone watch unless wanting a feel good romance."
"391",5,"  Best movie I've seen in a long time. Good guys win, bad guy goes down... Classic Spielberg. Refreshing to see a feel good movie about following your heart and standing up against impossible odds. A visual delight, dont sell yourself short, catch this one on the big screen!!! Thank you to all who helped make this movie what it is! Bravo!"
"392",5,"  Honestly, I expected a cameo filled movie like this to be, well, nothing but cameos. I expected a weak plot, and weak characters, but was instead thrown down a very exciting and existential rabbit hole. The movie handles the source material very well, and the cgi is absolutely incredible. the movie is a beautiful tribute to new and old pop culture, and is a movie about video games that does the medium justice."
"393",5,"  This is how you do a movie. If you have not watched it, you are missing out. Great story, emotional, funny, action packed, and incorporates nostalgic moments from the past. If I had extra thumbs, I would give it more than two thumbs up."
"394",5,"  Steven Spielberg at his very best"
"395",5,"  Hace mucho no veía una peli que me gustara de Ã©sta manera, hiper la recomiendo ????"
"396",4,"  Great movie. Good story and the animation was on point."
"397",4,"  4.0/5.0 stars - Grade: B+"
"398",2,"  If I hadn't read the book it would have been ok. Even still, it could have and should have been much better. Why almost completely re-write a script from scratch when you don't have to? I would estimate about 80% of this movie is completely fabricated, and not for the better. I was very excited about this film and left pretty disappointed. It reminded me a bit of Ender's Game in that way- epic novel, very forgettable film ??."
"399",4.5,"  Critics who make it about some political issue which is really not anything new I think the movie is alright. Its not the best movie ever made but it did have a good message that we need to live in reality we have to live in it."
"400",4.5,"  A truly great movie. Fun and well done story telling. I can't wait to see it again. It was a blast!"
"401",4.5,"  I loved this movie. The constant Easter eggs and decent main story line made it easily worth the 12 dollars. The love plot line was pointless because of how little time the movie had for development compared to the book. The uncle and aunt of the main protagonist kinda just were there and then disappeared. This should have had more development. Over all this is a great movie for any 80's movie buff or anyone who enjoys arcades."
"402",5,"  Ready Player One is a nostalgic, exciting, and overall fun experience that blows you away."
"403",5,"  Really fun movie that has some good improvements over the book and some changes that were a little confusing. As a stand alone movie it's a fun nostalgic film ride that might not be for everyone but if you love 80's pop culture, this was made for you."
"404",0.5,"  Absolutely terrible. If you read the book you will hate this movie. Not even worth the time spent watching. Hated almost every second."
"405",3.5,"  I enjoyed this movie but it sure did veer WAAAAAY off the book."
"406",4.5,"  I loved this movie so much. A pop culture holy grail that hearkens back to Spielberg's films of old. Fantastic."
"407",4.5,"  A wonderful walk down memory lane. Great action, and a wonderful touching story.. if you grew up on the 80s I highly recommend seeing this movie!"
"408",4,"  You know what this movie reminds me of? Avatar -- the James Cameron flick. Remember that one? It was the movie that essentially added mind-blowing CGI to the plot from Dances With Wolves. It basically took an existing storyline and re-envisioned it using special effects. Ready Player One utilizes this same strategy. Despite it being an adaptation, I'm approaching this movie as a standalone effort from a film perspective. The plot is very basic: an innovation, largely integrated into the human lifestyle and meant to benefit all, is suddenly threatened by a greedy corporation when an opportunity to assume complete control over the product presents itself, and it's up to the heroes to foil the scheme of the power-hungry antagonists. An all-too-familiar plot this is indeed. However, as with Avatar, no fault lies in taking a familiar storyline and presenting it in a new way. Movies have done this for ages. What then makes Ready Player One unique? Again, as with Avatar, the effects are spectacular and wonderfully immersive. What then makes Ready Player One stand apart from Avatar? In my mind, this movie is better than Avatar for a few reasons: 1) the characters are more engaging and memorable; 2) So...Many...References! There are enough quotes, cameos, and tributes, both visual and verbal, obvious and subtle, to spark a myriad of conversations and add some serious re-watch value to this movie; 3) whereas the effects in Avatar are exclusive to its own story/characters, the effects here are incredibly more diverse and encompass an enormous range of characters and designs; and 4) this movie is just ridiculous loads of fun. This is a movie best enjoyed with a big tub of popcorn and your brain switched off. It is a visual spectacle. No thinking required (except for spotting references and ecstatically blaring them out). It also has that signature Spielberg charm and whimsy and even a nice little moral to boot, promoting equal value to our reality and our escapes from it. Overall, the movie achieves exactly what it sets out to be: eye candy that's pure entertainment and a ton of fun."
"409",1,"  This movie was almost completely different from the book. I loved the book and was eagerly anticipating the movie. The movie was very very different and not in a good way. I almost walked out."
"410",5,"  Best movie i have seen at the cinemas for quite some time, i am an avid gamer and i understood all of those references. My Fiance who absolutely has no interest in games loved it."
"411",3.5,"  A fun evening at the cinema. The film heavily relies on a wealth of iconography, which sometimes feels as weightless as the VR world we live in, but there's one instance that is impressively designed, giving us new angles to a set most of us have come to know and love."
"412",5,"  Excelent movie!!!!!!"
"413",4.5,"  Iron Giant + Mechagodzilla + Gundam = pretty damn awesome."
"414",5,"  Way better than expected. Quite a few of my friends said it would be stupid. I disagree. It was great."
"415",3.5,"  Strengths: This movie is flat out cool. There are so many nods to pop culture from the past thirty years that you'll need to watch it more than once just to try and spot them all. The visuals are stunning and Steven Spielberg once again shows why he has a penchant for making dazzling blockbusters. Most of the voice work is strong, highlighted by Olivia Cooke (Samantha/Art3mis) and Lena Waithe (Helen/Aech). In fact, they're probably the best parts of the non-CGI scenes, too. The story is simple, but effective. The villain is unlikable and you want to root for the good guys. They're relatable in how they want to escape the harshness of the real world, yet are strong enough to fight to change it. As stated though, the true strengths are the visuals and the references. The Shining scene is great and there were plenty of twists thrown into the story to keep you on the edge of your seat.Weaknesses: Tye Sheridan (Wade/Parzival) is fine as the lead, but doesn't command the screen as much as he should. While his avatar is cool, he does nothing to make you remember him after you finish watching. The romance part of the movie lacks something and feels kind of rushed. The characters get a lot of screen time together, but everything seems to move too quickly. The same goes for the relationship between the creator of OASIS and the girl he had feelings for. I think the challenges that were laid out to win the fortune seemed to be a bit too simple. The riddles were fine, but the actual work it took to complete them lacked. Several characters don't get really fleshed out or developed enough.Overall: Ready Player One is a lot of fun. That goes double for video game players who know their pop culture. You'll enjoy the hell out of it just for each reference you see pop up. The romantic stuff and character development are lacking, while the lead actor isn't great. That being said, there's enough enjoyment and action to make this film a success."
"416",5,"  best of movie this is gift best of pop culture"
"417",2.5,"  Totoo many things happening."
"418",4,"  I'm totally not the target audience for ""Ready Player One"" but, then again, Steven Spielberg is considerably older than I am. And, though I generally hate video games, I did like this film. It's not going to go down in history like ""E.T."" or ""Jaws"" or ""Raiders."" But whatever. After being so serious lately it's good to see Spielberg having fun again. The acting is fine (though only new Spielberg favorite Mark Rylance really registers strongly). The score by Alan Silvestri has flickers of John Williams without ever soaring to Williams' magical levels. ""Ready Player One"" is a fine - more than fine - bit of popcorn entertainment that should make a few hundred million worldwide. And it makes one wonder whether there might be another ""E.T."" in the old master to come."
"419",5,"  The best movie of the year, i like so much."
"420",4.5,"  A fun adventure immersed in pop culture. In the year 2045, people can escape their harsh reality in the OASIS, an immersive virtual world where you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own imagination. OASIS creator James Halliday left his immense fortune and control of the Oasis to the winner of a contest designed to find a worthy heir. When unlikely hero Wade Watts conquers the first challenge of the reality-bending treasure hunt, he and his friends-known as the High Five-are hurled into a fantastical universe of discovery and danger to save the OASIS and their world.Spielberg, one of the most famous minds in Hollywood, comes out with another film. While his last couple may not have been the best pieces of work, you can still see here that he's still got some left in the tank. And while this film may be boosted just based on references alone, it doesn't negate the fact that I just had fun, and it's the most fun I've had in theater this year. One thing that's fantastic about this film is the animation. The composition, CGI, and animation of this film were all glorious. When I first saw the trailers, I was iffy on it, but when seeing it in the theaters, I was in awe. Everything looked absolutely gorgeous here and it all looked as good as it should have. The film was so smooth and the action sequences were so mesmerizing. There was so much fun to be had in this film and a lot of it came from the beautiful, colorful visuals that appeared on screen. This film, as you can tell from the trailers, is filled with pop culture reference. It's filled with so much pop culture that you probably won't even know you're looking at a reference half the time. It's just impossible to know all of them but when you can see all the small things, it just warms your heart. Everything from the assault rifle from Halo, to the Ninja Turtles kicking ass on Doom Planet, to the Iron Giant fighting for the Oasis, everything is here. I'm shocked at how much rights they had to obtain, albeit some were already owned. Anyways, it was just really fun to see all this pop culture in there, especially when it's showing us just how valuable and inspirational all of this has on society today. In general, this was just a really fun film. The storyline wasn't overly complicated and if anything, it was pretty generic and predictable. The dialogue is fun but it's nothing special. If anything, this movie really is fueled and boosted by the amount of references here. It also feels like it's catered toward kids sometimes as it goes for comedic moments and a cheesy romance instead of going further with its darker themes. Either way, I just couldn't help but smile throughout the entire thing and I can't take away from that.In the end, ""Ready Player One"" was simply just a fun and happy time. I really enjoyed my experience with this film and like I said, it's nowhere near perfect. However, I think this is one of those experiences that you should have in the theater with everyone else. Watch it for the exciting, gritty car racing scenes, hilarious moments, awesome references, epic battles, and exciting adventures. Let yourself smile and enjoy this movie just as I did."
"421",4.5,"  Brought back so many childhood memories great movie."
"422",0.5,"  Ready Player One is a movie about a dystopian future where mankind as a whole has stop trying to solve their real life problems and instead tries to runaway their problem by escaping into a Virtual World call Oasis. I did not enjoy the movie at all because I find the movie to be predictable, boring and none of the characters and entities within the movie are likable or admirable in anyway. The game that the movie revolves around, Oasis, as far as i can tell is a game that is built based on the freeprium or ""pay to win model"" where players can either spend a large amount of time in game to earn virtual currencies in order to buy upgrades or can pay real world money to buy in game upgrades that allows them to get a competitive edge against other players. Players can then compete for relics which then they can resell for large amount of ingame virtual currency which in turn they can use to buy virtual or real world gaming items. Within the movie it seems like it is quite routine for consumers to over stretch their budget in order to buy virtual upgrades that they hope will allow them to win one of these ""relics"". The main character's uncle is one such person who spent their families saving only to lose everything when his virtual character is killed with in the game. As such I have difficulty characterizing the company that made and maintains Oasis as anything other than an evil corporation. While the movie portrayed Nolan Sorrento as the villain of the movie, I personally think the true villain is the creator of Oasis James Halliday. James Halliday is a someone with a god complex who is incapable developing any kind of real connection with his fellow human beings. When told that he need to take responsibility for the unintended negative impact that Oasis has had on mankind, instead of making the necessary changes to Oasis, instead he decided to force out his partner and allow mankind to continue to to fall into the state of disarray. To accelerate the process of decay and get more people to get addicted to his game, upon his death, he created a competition for all Oasis player to search for three keys. The ones who managed to win all three keys inherits all of his fortune which in the movie is said to be about half a trillion dollars. The key to winning all of the competition is not about being smart, or kind, or brave, but rather based on how much you know about the creator of the game. As such the creator create an incentive for the world to essentially study and learn about every facet of his life including his likes and dislikes. By creating the competition he essentially elevated himself into a king or god like status reminiscent of how people in the past would study Mao, Stalin or Hitler. He also incentivizes all the people in the world to invest all their time and energy into playing the game rather than to solve real world problems. While Nolan Sorrento might be responsible for the suffering of thousands and 10s of thousands, James Halliday is responsible for the downfall of the human civilization. The protagonist of the movie is a young adult 18 years old who as far as i can tell doesn't go to school, doesn't go to work, has common sense of a child when it comes to online safety and spends all of his time playing the Oasis game. The protagonist's ability to associate with real people is so poor that he seems to be more concerned about the future of the Oasis game itself than the fact that the evil IOI corporation killed his aunt, uncle and neighbors. In the end the I find protagonist to be extremely unlikable due to the fact that reminds me of someone who is looking for a short cut through life (in his case beating a video game) rather than someone who tries to put together a plan and grind it out in the real world through honest work. Storyline was paper thin and extremely predictable. The world that is created by the movie is incredibly depressing and none of the characters are really likable. Even after the near 3 hour movie, neither the world nor protagonist went through any kind of transformation for the better and instead the protagonist was handsomely rewarded despite his naivety and poor decisions in life and god knows how many people's life savings were completely wiped out due the event of the movie."
"423",3.5,"  Well produced and adapted from the beloved novel, this film marks a return to director Steven Spielberg's fun side. With enough 80s cinema references to fill nerd blogs for a good while, it's a joyful ride that brings nostalgia & something new-ish to the virtual reality sci-fi movie."
"424",4.5,"  Definitely a fangirl/fanboy movie. Loved it!"
"425",4.5,"  I liked it better than the book."
"426",5,"  Ready Player One does an excellent job balancing story,effects and nostalgia to provide an action-packed marvel of a film."
"427",5,"  this movie is just awesomeness behind awesomeness!"
"428",5,"  it is a wonderful movie able to share the love for more than videogames but the pop culture of the 80s so well., a couple of things were a little to ""scriptd"" but that was fidelity to the text.Many many details that stik to the book and didn't got explined in the movie shows dedication. I hope to see a directors cut later this year, and directors commentary ....no sequel this is a one hit wonder."
"429",2.5,"  The Shining scene is awesome. The rest is a convoluted mess."
"430",5,"  AMAZING. I've never wanted to see a 2:20 movie again the day after seeing it!"
"431",5,"  Ready, Player One is a fantastic film. In it a young man, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) , races through both the virtual world of the Oasis and the real world with his friends, including Samantha (Olvia Cooke), to solve the puzzle that will reward him with control of the Oasis. The Oasis is the virtual reality world that the majority of the Earth's populace uses to escape the humdrum life on an overpopulated, polluted planet. Everyone is competing against a powerful corporation that wants to control the Oasis, monetizing it to extremes. It's a glorious ride. Anything is possible in the Oasis and director Steven Spielberg makes full use of this. He lets loose his imagination and reworks the original novel, matching up fictional worlds and characters like you always wanted to as kids, in an exhilarating orgy of excitement and mayhem. Where else will you get the Iron Giant, Mecha Godzilla and Chuckie the killer doll all in one film? The only complaint I have with the film is that most of the villains are a tad too generic. Big corporations are bad. Companies see the population as nothing but tools to use to raise profits. And the company's head, Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) is so slimy that all he is missing is a mustache to twirl. Thankfully the heroes are well enough defined to keep me interested in seeing how they win. You can be whoever you want to be in the Oasis. Men can be women, children can be adults, wimps can be race car drivers, whatever you want. Your imagination is the limit. You know what the ending will be, but it's nothing that stands in the way of having so much fun that I can't wait to see the film again."
"432",4.5,"  ""Ready Player One"" is that perfect example of how the gaming society should be taken, and Spielberg has truly grasped what a gamer wants, and told a story that plays it smart."
"433",2,"  If you don't play video games, don't go. Another film with an EXTRA hour of motion-sickness inducing FX battle scenes. Again, ""We paid for the FX and are using every second of it."
"434",2,"  Graphics were great. The story was flat and predictable."
"435",5,"  Great Movie and Great read. Of course there were changes, but it was done well. I just wanted to send some love, because I really enjoyed myself while watching RP1 come to life."
"436",4,"  Beautiful and gorgeous!"
"437",5,"  O melhor estilo de Spielberg, pura diversão para toda a famÃ­lia numa visÃ£o de futuro prÃ³ximo, e atÃ© possÃ­vel tirando as favelas de trailers"
"438",4.5,"  I thoroughly appreciated the references to MMO and gamer culture, as well as the larger themes such as P2W, freedom of identity and exploration, escape, and friendship that resonate with gamers"
"439",4.5,"  With an immense amount of pop culture references and cameos, beautiful and overwhelming visuals, and a plot that keeps you guessing and waiting, Ready Player One is a movie that almost anyone can watch and enjoy, young and old."
"440",2,"  It's a gorgeous dumpster fire."
"441",5,"  Good storyline with so many Easter eggs it's hard to keep up. Great music, effects. What more could you ask for?"
"442",5,"  So many treats in one movie... gonna have to rewatch this a few times! Spielberg is back to his best."
"443",1,"  Maybe its a good movie if you're not a fan of the book. But this almost has nothing to do with the book and the book is GREAT! What can you do?"
"444",4,"  The difference between the movie and the book took me aback but I still enjoyed the movie. The spirit of was still the same."
"445",5,"  In my perspective I watch movies to have fun and entertain and this movie blow my mind with a great effects and great story it makes my imagination go wild can't wait to have our own Oasis. . ."
"446",0.5,"  We were looking forward to this movie. Our family read the book multiple times and loved it. The book has a great storyline. If you are thinking you'll see any of the book on the screen, you are grossly mistaken. The only thing that made it from the book are characters' names and the fact there are threee keys. We left seriously disappointed. What a complete waste of effort."
"447",4,"  So I went to see the movie ""READY PLAYER ONE""The film ""READY PLAYER ONE"" is a good movie full of East Pearls.You can say with certainty that this film just created for us Geeks.The story was really good.The film included everything from everything was action, stress, adventure and a little love.But I missed something I do not quite know. But at the end of the film I did not feel wow he was just a nice movie.The film was mesmerizing and I could not stop looking for Easter Pear.Across the Internet they wanted a lot of criticism because of the huge amount of Easter pear in the film people did not enjoy the film but I do not agree! Hester Pearce only added to the film's experience. It was fun to look in every corner and face for our favorite accessories and figures.The film is suitable for any age and any type of geek whether you are a gamer or a movie lover or a technology lover and an enthusiast."
"448",5,"  This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Spielberg has successfully bridged the gap between gaming and video game cultures. You needn't be a gamer to enjoy this fantasy movie. I actually spent the whole movie with a smile on my face this was so amazing. If i could afford it i'd keep going to the theater to watch it in IMAX 3D. This is definitely a movie to see in IMAX if you can. Because it truly shines on the big screen in 3D. I truly can't rave about this movie enough. Go, take friends, tell people about your experience. This movie needs to be seen. The moral of this movie couldn't ring more true in today's time; we need to connect more with the people around us. So share this movie with someone you love. :)"
"449",4.5,"  The book was awesome and this movie was really enjoyable. A lot of 80's and 80's moments! I will definitely see this again and buy the movie."
"450",5,"  A well-done film, to me, is one that keeps me purely entertained, doesn't contain many, if any, plot holes, is finely acted, and keeps me positively engaged. This is that type of film. The one thing to remember: this is a pure fantasy-type film. However, the real-world ridiculousness of corporate entities spending tons of money just to earn tons more money, at the expense of anyone and anything, is purely evident here. And the cliched ""little people"" against the ""big people"" theme is certainly played out here. But it works and it works really well. I love the fact that this movie used relative unknowns for all of the major roles. I was only familiar with Tye from the X-Men movie. Simon, I'm a huge fan of, but he wasn't a main character. The others, I've never seen before. The American accents from Ben and Simon were perfect. This movie kept me completely engaged from the word ""go"". Its pace kept my adrenaline going and its homages to the 80's were perfection, though it is hard for me to fathom that no other significant anthem songs were released between 1980 and 2045. This movie was pure entertainment, for entertainment purposes. And I absolutely loved it."
"451",5,"  One of best movies I've ever seen, some people say it wasn't as good but they just don't understand what the movie is really about"
"452",4,"  This film looks spectacular and had me smiling throughout. Loved a load of the references. There was a few plot hole's and questionable actions in the film but nothing major."
"453",3,"  While Ready Player One delivers some spectacular Spielbergian visuals, it fails to capture the pathos of its source material."
"454",3.5,"  Deep inside I want to give it a 10/10, but I have to point out the flaws and be truthful with my rating. I felt the movie fell apart around the sending squence in the real world. Awesome movie overall though."
"455",4.5,"  I really enjoyed this movie, it was so fun to catch all the different references to games, movies and everything 80's. I have read the book numerous times and think this is a great addition to the Ready Player One options. I think Speilberg did a great job of keeping the underlying theme of the book as the core of the movie."
"456",1,"  For an actual story, and not a brainless string of action sequences, read the book of the same name."
"457",2.5,"  I have read the book. I am attempting to separate the two for the purpose of this review. tl;dr - It's a fun movie with lots of action. The main character is boring and the plot is a series of Dues Ex Machinas and straight up plot holes coinciding to form a resolution.Pros: Movie is fun. It has genuine laughs, thrills, and chills. The references are cool without feeling like advertising (mostly) and the acting is solid. The Oasis is gorgeous to look at and the action is amazing in 3d. Definitely see this in 3d if you can spring for it. The race is exactly as cool as the trailer implies and a Gundam fights Mechagodzilla with the Iron Giant which is pretty dope.Cons: Not clever at all. Wade is a generic everyman protagonist with the motivation of One Punch Man played straight instead of for laughs. Cooke shines and the movie should have been about her. Art3mis is more interesting than Wade by a wide margin. The final battle is cool, but there is so much more that could be done. Instead we see Wade driving around in his Delorian shooting various weapons out the window while seeing glimpses of other characters from various worlds who are probably doing much cooler stuff. Also in that previously mentioned Iron Giant + Gundam Vs Mechagodzilla fight the protagonist is none of those which should really disqualify him from being the protagonist. In the interest of spoilers I'm not going to go into detail about all the plot holes that exist in this movie, but there are a lot.Also if you haven't read the book, wait until you've seen the movie. You'll probably enjoy it more."
"458",0.5,"  This is the movie that gets made when IOI wins. All of the character that made the book's quest and players interesting was changed for no discernible reason."
"459",0.5,"  Spielberg is an embarrassment."
"460",5,"  very good movie fun and interesting"
"461",2.5,"  Good message but a violent sensory assault"
"462",4,"  Louise & me enjoyed this. I think it helps that we were around in the 80s and there's nods to Akira, Gundam Wing and Mecha Godzilla...I know, cool memories and Nostalgia do not a film make, but it was an entertaining yarn too..Won't lie though, the Shinning & Alien references seemed a little extreme.-hilarious, but extreme."
"463",4.5,"  As far as adaptations go, I've rarely seen a movie make so many changes to the source material. Every trial was changed, the characters look different, that plot was massively altered... about the only thing that's book accurate are the character's names and races. Somehow, in spite of all of that, Ready Player One managed to capture the heart of the book in a way that more faithful adaptations so rarely do.In both novel and movie form, Ready Player One is a love letter to nerd culture. Almost every scene in the movie is packed with references to movies, video games, and comic books. I managed to catch Raven from Teen Titans in some street art at one point and I'm sure I missed a thousand other references hidden in the background. This is the kind of movie people are going to go through frame by frame to catch everything and they'll still miss stuff!But while all that's great, what is this story actually about and is the plot any fun?Imagine that the richest man in the world loves video games and is brilliant at creating them. Then imagine that man dies, only instead of leaving his wealth to his heirs, he creates a treasure hunt in his greatest video game with all his wealth going to the person who completes the hunt first.This is Ready Player One and, no matter which version you pick, it's a blast from start to finish. The movie also gets the rare honor of being of equal quality to the book in this reader's eyes. While the book's treasure hunt was better due to the fact that it could be drawn out over several hundred pages instead of having to be summed up in two hours, the movie had a better sense of humor and the characters were a lot more fun and fleshed out because it's no longer a first-person story. The movie also vastly improved upon the book's romance, which was a massive drawback for me and many of the novel's critics. It's still not a love for the ages, but it went from cringe-worthy-at-best to harmless fluff.If you enjoy video games, nerdy movies, or even just stunning visuals, then Ready Play One is well worth your time. While I'd probably give this a 4/5 for plot, characters, and humor, I'm bumping it up to a 5/5 for the insane amount of effort put into pumping this thing full of Easter eggs for viewers to find. Those elements take a decent movie and make it something that I'd happily watch several times over, if only to see if I can spot something that I missed the last time I watched it.If you do enjoy the movie, I would recommend giving the book a shot. As I said before, its romance side-plot has some major issues, but main story is strong enough that I could look past it. I was also really glad that I'd read it while watching the movie because this one movie very fast and I think my background knowledge made the plot a lot easier to follow."
"464",4,"  Ready Player One is a unique, dazzling, innovative story come to life on the big screen. Filled with '80's pop culture references, Spielberg's newest blockbuster delivers a fun time at the movies. It wasn't the most amazing or in-depth movie in the world, but its message was clear, and its storyline wacky, crazy, and exciting. It was a wild ride that serves as a solid and visually dazzling flick that will entertain many, whether you grew up in the '80's or not."
"465",1.5,"  the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title. Is a shitty adolescent movie with a videogame skin"
"466",5,"  Amazing recommend it"
"467",5,"  A love song dedicated to every 80's child. I was smiling ear to ear through the entire movie. Yes, 'the book was better'', but this movie enhanced the book in so many ways. I will be buying a copy of this when it comes out. To not only watch for fun, but to try and enjoy all the 'Easter eggs' I missed. The sad part is the fact a sequel is not feasible."
"468",4.5,"  Awesome movie with so many Easter eggs i lost count!"
"469",3.5,"  It's a fun movie, not amazing, but really fun. Really gave off a classic vibe in terms of story-telling and acting to the point that it felt like I was watching an 80s film made with modern technology. I never read the book though, and at times I wasn't sure if there were some things I was missing out on due to the fact (although my friends who did read the book mentioned that the film and book are very different). I'd recommend this as a fun movie though. Great visuals, fun 80s vibe, and tons of easter eggs.ps. without giving away too much I really enjoyed the second key challenge ;)"
"470",1,"  As a stand alone film I would have enjoyed it. As a film adaptation of a book it was abismal. They threw away the soul of the book. What garbage."
"471",4.5,"  A really fun movie, and i cannot see why anyone would criticize it based on its visuals and fun nostalgia. Really fun time, want to see it again."
"472",5,"  another brilliant movies by steven Spielberg , loved the plot, great acting and awesome visual effect definitely will watching again!"
"473",3,"  A non stop wave of nostalgia inducing ""easter eggs"" and product placements. A story that is simple, with little character development, some good humorous moments and is akin to that of Harry Potter or Hunger games, and themes similar to Sword Art Online. Really there is nothing new or lasting in this movie. It completely relies on its references and is very forgettable."
"474",3.5,"  Run-of-the-mill adventure movie with thrilling visual effects. 60% of the movie is CGI, so only watch it if you're into that sort of thing. It's a fun movie for all ages, even with the references to pop culture and video games from the 80s/90s."
"475",5,"  99.8%.Its not for everyone. But for me, this was the greatest movie experience of my entire life. All the games I grew up playing on the big screen in one more, presented in an incredible way. I cannot express in words what this was like. I often use this one analogy when I describe what going to Comic-Con is like for people who have never been to one -- ""It's like a child going to the zoo and seeing animals for the first time"" - well that is sort of what this movie was like for me. I remember when one character says the words, ""I choose the form of ... Gundam"" I literally jumped out of my seat and started clapping. This was ... this was everything. I would legitimately even see this again (except I'm going to opt for maybe buying it on DVD when it becomes available because there were about 100 easter eggs in it that i'd love to find). Other than being incredibly rich with amazing video game and pop culture references, Ready Player One is an incredible movie on its own. While it won't be nearly as enjoyable to non-gamers, It has a fantasic storyline and lots of action that any fan of action/adventure films will enjoy. Without delving too deep into it, in 2025 a man creates the first working Fully Virtual Reality (VR) world just in the nick of time as the world's resources were being depleted and life was looking glum. In 2047, the creator of this incredible virtual world where you can be anyone and do anything (much like the tv series Caprica) passes away and informs players that he has hidden an easter egg in the game and whoever finds it will be able to change the world in their own image as well as inherit his half a trillion dollars worth of stock. A company called IOI or Innovative Online Industries restructures their entire company to trying to find the keys to unlock the easter egg in the virtual world and remake it in their image - one rules by advertisements. The movie focuses on an average young man, and avid gamer, who knows everything there is to know about the VR world's creator and ends up finding the first key - inciting IOI to come after him in real life. Well I would not necessarily recommend this movie to anyone over 45, for all others ... this is as good as it gets people. This is entertainment."
"476",5,"  Speilberg magic should be 98 percente d of your saying that fucking beetle juice is better than this fuck of your not critics you fucking morans you haven't better seen films"
"477",4,"  Pretty good adaptation of one of my favorite books. Of course they took some liberties but it would have been hard to include all of the detail (especially about the games and game history) in a two hour nineteen minute movie. If you can suspend with expectations tied to the book it's really enjoyable."
"478",2.5,"  Save your money on this one. Premise was a tron ripoff. It's hard to swallow credulity while trying to watch because you have to suspend so much disbelief as to make this a very juvenile movie. If you'r e under 12 go see it, if not, skip it."
"479",1.5,"  Poor follow through and script that doesn't make sense."
"480",4.5,"  Amazing film! All of the references it's like a video game/movie fanatic's wet dream. My personal favorite is the Stephen King 'The Shining' scene. Absolutely phenomenal. Definitely didn't think I would like it at first after seeing the trailer, but I'll definitely say after seeing the movie I love it. 100% recommend seeing this. Steven Spielberg did it again."
"481",4,"  Overall I enjoyed it, but they really detracted from the book. There were some pretty awkward moments, but there were some great ones as well. I don't want to get into spoilers, but I wish there were puzzles to find the gates instead of it showing up once they grabbed the keys. Need to watch it over and over to see most of the hidden characters."
"482",5,"  it was a thrilling action romance movie, with many twist and turns i would recamend it to all."
"483",5,"  Such a great experience! So many funny moments and so many Easter Eggs and references to other games and movies! Brought back so many memories! The screen write is so good. You can't do less than cheer all the time for the main characters! It's great movie for people that grew playing video games and that are aware of the pop culture!"
"484",3,"  Although I wound up liking this movie, it did focus more on visuals and nostalgia than story."

"488",3,"  Although I wound up liking this movie, it did focus more on visuals and nostalgia than story."
"489",3.5,"  Enjoyed the movie, great fun. Not overly complicated, but wish Sorrento was a lil more of a competent and less inept villian. Would have made the ending more satisfying. Also, wish they included the nostalgic parts a bit more other than the quick flashes in the mega-battle scene at the end. But as a 80's baby, I really enjoyed it and had a good time."
"490",4.5,"  Even though this movie is much different from the book, I still found it very fun and well done. The virtual reality world is amazing to be in and the reality world is not overly depressing like so many recent movies. Great humor and incredible action. I highly recommend it."
"491",5,"  T'was a jolly good showwww"
"492",5,"  One of the best movies I have see in recent times. Absolutely fantastic.. Must watch for a gamer. I would compare this movie to avatar where people are taken to a different world to experience the magic that can only happen with cgi, GREAT MOVIE!!!!!"
"493",5,"  Lives up to the high standard of the book. The changes made helped immensely with the flow and level of suspense. All I want to do is sit and pause the movie to soak in all of the characters spanning across so many franchises in every scene. This was honestly a movie I thought would never work because of all the licensing issues they would have, but they pulled it off and pulled it off masterfully."
"494",3.5,"  good movie but cringy and has too many dumb cameos from game characters that arent relevant also it was pretty predictable some parts were interesting thought and the visuals were good but will probably not be as good as game graphics in 2045"
"495",4.5,"  As a gamer and someone who has read the book I loved the movie. So did my gamer wife and 12 year old daughter. My 5 year old wasn't so interested in it. I give it a 8+ out of 10. The book is intriguing while the movie is action. Two very different but both are awesome."
"496",4,"  Visually an Epic Pastiche of a Nerd's 80's and 90's Memorabilia collection made onto film. Action scenes are well made, and CG is well crafted, although at times you feel like you are a watching a Video Game cinematic, but this seems to be done on purpose. The story albeit generic, is well crafted in its arcs, and though it suffers from some less than ideal acting specially in the ""real world"", it makes for an entertaining and fun pop-corn flick."
"497",3,"  Very intense visuals, beautifully rendered. Some of the story didn't make sense to me, had that ""you just have to accept it"" type of feel. Very very very corny, I could see mostly anyone 30 or under cringing at some of the scenes. A few of the pop culture references and other video game references were pretty clever and done nicely.Didn't like the way the relationship between two of the main characters felt so forced and quick paced. I cringed every time they made moves on each other, the whole time I thought it was one sided and that one person was using the other person but it turned out to be sincere. Also didn't understand how a corporation could get away with terrorism within the borders of the US (in broad daylight) several times. The authorities never showed their face until the cliche last moment, saving the plot from becoming an actual tragedy. I never read the book, I'm wondering if my opinions would be any different. I feel like I lot of meat was cut out in order to produce something that'd make sense."
"498",2.5,"  I understand liberties have to be taken when converting a book to a movie, especially one that requires so much licencing. But it was hardly the same story. Why was this movie even made? Boring and disappointing. It felt rushed and incomplete. It had a lack of mystery, imagination, and adventure, as well as character development. Everything felt undeserved. Plus, though the OASIS scenes were cool, I really wasn't that impressed, and they still often felt like a clusterf. Also there were so many plot holes and impossibilities in the story and characters, even in a movie like this, that I was kind of annoyed."
"499",4,"  Muy diferente al libro, pero me gustó. La segunda llave es lo mejor de la pelÃ­cula, entre miles de eastern eggs."
"500",4,"  Really enjoyed it! Captured much of the spirit of the book, while changing almost all the references. Still great to see how many they were able to make! A few missed opportunities from the book that I thought would have really fit their message and story, but great none the less :)"
"501",1,"  Really really bad. Nothing makes any sense. The protagonist and antagonist's motivations are pretty much non existent, there are no stakes, it's not even entertaining. Don't see."
"502",5,"  gran pelicula del 2018"
"503",3.5,"  3.5 stars. Impressively ambitious to a fault, and fills up just enough pop culture references to leave room for a fun story. As far as a dystopian film however, its unoriginality is both its greatest strength and its biggest weakness."
"504",1.5,"  If only Spielberg wrote The Matrix. RP1 has a much simpler and current understanding of vertual reality. Those who discredit this film because it's too nostalgic miss the point. The nostalgia makes the film fun and watchable for those of us 44 year olds and helps us remember the 80's with fondness. This is deliberate and makes the film so enjoyable to watch, even if the film does appear juvenile in a world that takes itself too seriously."
"505",1,"  I don't even know where to begin with this movie, this movie is just a gigantic disappointment before this movie came out i decided to read the book before watching the movie. Then i went and watched the movie excited about how Spielberg was going to recreate this engaging plot with 3 dimensional characters with all the 80's references and everything like that. NOTHING FROM THE BOOK WAS UTILISED i swear to god i had my hand in my head throughout the movie thinking about how i paid real money to watch some cgi playground with no meaning at all. I don't even know how people are praising this movie? It's either they haven't read the book (which i recommend they do, it's a great book) or they are the type of people who watch movies and get bored when there is no explosions and cars crashing into each other to listen to 5 minutes of character development. I am just extremely disappointed in this movie the movie doesn't even suck it's just a mediocre movie that will probably be forgotten as ""that movie about video games and 80's stuff"""" instead of being remembered as a thought provoking movie like inception.The reason i gave this movie a one star and not like two is because i was expecting a lot form Spielberg especially when he was one of my favourite directors until well you know this thing came out. I don't know what he was thinking was out of greed and pure laziness or is it because he didn't know how to approach a movie like this. It's like he ripped out pages of the book dumped them into a bag picked out 5 random pages and said ""Yeah let's put this in the movie"" and dumped the rest of the pages.I am just gonna end this review/rant of how the movie sucked and say just read the book and skip this movie."
"506",4,"  Muy buena combinación de generaciones a travÃ©s de la mÃºsica y los personajes... Muy buena historia. Thumbs UP!!"
"507",4,"  I was disappointed in some of the plot choices Spielberg made in comparison with the book, though i realize some of the detailed 80's pop culture references in the book had to be extracted to fit the knowledge base of a larger movie going audience. Biggest disappointment was making the real world main characters too attractive. Art3mis was supposed to have a much more promiment birthmark, and Wade was supposed to be pasty and chubby. Both details from the book fit the plot better than the more attractive movie counterparts. Overall, I am delighted to have one of my favorite books made into a movie by one of the greatest directors of all time."
"508",2,"  A cheap celebration childhood popculture namedropping carried badly by a clichÃ© story and flat characters. Everyone under 21 will love this sloppy pile of overhyped Bantha poo. We'll soon forget about this one."
"509",5,"  Super fun and if you have enjoyed video games and pop culture over the last 40 years then you will love all the references. If you havent it is still a ton of fun."
"510",4,"  Lots of great characters and visual effects. Some plot holes but it's an entertaining movie. It's basically a 2 hour PSA to put down our digital addictions and unplug every once in a while."
"511",3,"  Fun adventure film with a lot of pop culture references."
"512",4.5,"  If you've read the book, don't expect it to be like the book, at all. Treat it as an alternate telling of the story, like how the new Battlestar Galactica was quite different from the old, yet still amazing. That's what Ready Player One is. Very different, but still a must see. If you're in your 40's and were into geeky stuff, this is like a heartfelt homage to your childhood. I was grinning throughout and felt like a kid again!"
"513",4,"  Muy buena pelicula, se entiende muy bien lo que desea explicar. La pelicula demuestra a lo que puede llegar a ser la sociedad actual en un futuro y como perderiamos la consiencia de la realidad inconcientemente.En terminos de estetica... la verdad es que la pelicula aplica muy bien los efectos y las escenas actuadas, la bajo un poco por detalles tales como reflejos, enfoque de luz, errores de actuacion los cuales son muy minimos.Pero en si genial pelicula, perfecta para ir jovenes con sus amigos. No la recomiendo para adultos ya que implica temas que ellos actualmente capÃ¡z que no los entiendan.Muy recomendada."
"514",4,"  Very entertaining. A good story accompanied by lots of 80s references. iT'S DEFINITELY WORTH YUOR TIME TO WATCH IT. i GREW UP IN THE 80S AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SEE IT. mY 10 YEAR OLD ENJOYED IT AS WELL SO THIS IS A MOVIE ALL AGES CAN ENJOY."
"515",1,"  Fans of the book beware, the floor will surely fall from under you like the final scene in the movie... This movie is at best an adaptation of the book, it differs so much in some respects that it alters the story completely... if you like gaming, and were young during the 80's and have only seen the movie, do yourself the favor and read the book."
"516",4.5,"  Steven Spielberg had a huge influence on my love for movies. Recently, last 10 years i have noticed that recent movies are technically good, but kind of old-fashioned and without spark. Ready Player One brought that spark for me. Of course, Im in love with pop culture and pop culture references that contain this movie and novel, it was to be expected. I was afraid that Spielberg will be lost in too much CGI, virtual world Oasis, but i was wrong, that was even the most entertaining and convincing part of this movie. And yes i know, there should be corny sweet moments as it is movie for grown up kids, and new generation of kids, but i didn't mind those moments, it doesn't go overboard with it. Ready Player 1 is the cutest film i have seen this year, made me smile all throughout, it is a movie for movie geeks, nerds brought up in the 80s and 90s. Absolute gem, feel good movie of the year."
"517",5,"  An absolute delight and a lovely adaptation of the book! Once again, Spielberg brings out the charm and skillfully applies it to geek culture and gamer communities! (So many Batman and Overwatch gems, I love it!)"
"518",4,"  The biggest problem with Ready Player One is that the references are mostly confined to pop culture from the 80s and 90s. In the universe, it would make a sort of sense that the devotees to the Oasis and to James Halliday would consume the same content Halliday did, despite this taking place 60 years after all of those pop culture references. But the downside is that tweens and teenagers would find this movie almost completely inaccessible (how many 13-year-olds have seen The Shining?).No, this movie is for the kids of the 80s and 90s, the ones who grew up with Buckaroo Banzai but consider the Bee Gees ""old school"" even if they're technically only a few years apart. The laughs and exhilaration were genuine from me, and there were so many things to notice that it made me want to see it again just for the sake of making sure I didn't miss anything. This is a movie without much depth but with lots of spectacle. It's a movie that capitalizes on nostalgia without digging deeper. It builds a virtual world and ignores the real one. It's a movie with characters that are two-dimensional but relatable. In other words, it's just like an 80s movie.(Note: I didn't read the book. Any responses that include the phase ""in the book..."" will be ignored and dismissed; this is a movie review, not a book review.)"
"519",1.5,"  THE MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING BUT DEPARTED DRASTICALLY FROM THE BOOK."
"520",4,"  Very good but for a teen who didn't watch The Shining, not as good as it could've been."
"521",1.5,"  Pop culture cannibalizes itself."
"522",4,"  Although set in Ohio in 2045, Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" opens with Van Halen's 1984 ""Jump"". Puzzling, and the nostalgia eventually reveals in the screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline, based on Cline's book. Most of ""Ready Player One"" is set in the virtual world OASIS, where you can game as your avatar. The movie is a visual marvel to behold. Yet, source material leave something to be desired. And at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's at least 30 minutes too long. Great message gets lost in aftermath."
"523",5,"  WOW. I read the book and this is just as fun. I will be seeing this OVER and OVER again!"
"524",4,"  Feels like I relived my childhood watching this film. Love all of the references. Got the feels when the Gundam came out."
"525",5,"  An extremely exciting, fun, and wild ride that makes you feel like a kid again. When it comes to adventure, Spielberg never fails!"
"526",2.5,"  Just mediocre. Boring."
"527",5,"  I loved the movie and I loved the book. It was absolutely spectacular."
"528",1,"  Utter garbage! If you read the book, you're sure to be greatly disappointed. Spielberg basically gutted the entire flick and made it ready to see adaptation of what amounts to a Disney flick. Everything that was good about the book was destroyed. Which is sure to leave all RP1 BOOK fans, feeling empty. How this is getting any positive reviews is beyind me? Maybe indicative of the direction our once great country is going as a whole. Garbage!"
"529",5,"  If you have a interest in gaming a must see."
"530",5,"  Fantastic visuals, great story."
"531",5,"  ??????????????????? ??????? Easter Egg ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Easter Egg ??????????????????????!! ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 2 ??????? 20 ?????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????? ????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????

"532",4,"  Movie was very good. If you read the book and expect to see it on screen, you will be disappointed. Go and enjoy it for itself, independent of the book. There are great references and nostalgia. They will move fast though, so be prepared. There is one mildly scary part that was not in the book based on a popular horror movie. Younger children may be scared."
"533",2,"  This movie is mediocre at best. Whilst the special effects are impressive and there are lots of references, that is where the good things about this movie end. There is no character development and the plot is both predictable and tedious."
"534",5,"  The best movie ever!"
"535",3,"  If you haven't read the book, I'm sure you'll find this movie really fun and enjoyable. It's probably a 4.5 star movie. If you HAVE read the book, this movie is NOT the book. I'd give it 2.5 stars, but I'll round up to 3. It has the spirit of the story, but lacks the soul of the book. All the references and things in the book that had an old nerd like me, turning pages, were replaced by things, that I assume, have a broader audience. As much as I understand the need for brevity in film adaptations, this isn't that. This is ""inspired by"" not ""based on""."
"536",5,"  Great film something for everyone enough action, future sci-fi,fantasy would definatly watch again"
"537",5,"  This is just an amazing movie! the great pop culture REFERENCES don't even weigh down an altogether solid story with great acting and cgi."
"538",4.5,"  I went into this film with no real expectations or knowledge of what this film was about (beyond the commercials). A few of my friends had read the book, and I was just along for the ride. I have to say I was genuinely impressed with this movie from start to finish. This film is a box office movie, but feels like a cult-classic film with all the old movie/ video-game references. I can see this being a film that many die-hards will watch over and over for years to come. The film does a incredible job with the following:1. Establishing meaningful characters in a short amount of time. 2. A near perfect flow to the movie; balancing action, character build, and comedy. 3. Creating an interesting and tense plot/ story4. AMAZING nostalgic touches (you gamers know what I'm talking about).5. Top-notch CGI, sound and action. This is a 7.5/10 film overall, a 9/10 for action/ CGI, and a 10/10 for entertainment. There was never a moment in this movie where I felt bored or lost (aka no The Last Jedi casino scene). The actors/ actresses were genuine and filled their respective roles nicely. The ONLY complaint I have is the end feeling a little cheesy, but that is pretty common for a movie like this. For my friends that read the book, they said the movie is very different in certain respects, but that being the case, they still loved it. Enjoy!"
"539",0.5,"  Bad bad baaaad film."
"540",3,"  Ready Player One has great cgi and the 3D effects are impressive at times. Its retro 80s theme unfortunately also applies to the flat characters and plotting. It doesn't make use of its semi-dystopian future to warn us about some end-game effects of current technologies or social trends. You don't care about the good guys or their quest, there are no politics - just a generic incompetent bad guy who should be a stand-in for something larger than personal ambition. History is flattened to mere pop culture nostalgia. The moral of the story is to only game 5 days a week, I guess, because reality, is, like, real...?"
"541",2.5,"  The movie almost never lives up to the book, but this was so far off it is ridiculous. The movie felt rushed and never gave you the time to care for the characters. Should have been multiple movies and needed better casting."
"542",4,"  A fun, multi-generational film with heart and soul."
"543",5,"  A great celebrating to my childhood"
"544",4.5,"  An exciting movie with great characters and thrilling action. Speilberg's talents really show here as the movie is directed fantastically. The special effects is fantastic and the references are just icing on the cake. The story is interesting and never stops moving. The pacing is excellent however there are some scenes that lack when compared to other scenes such as the dance scene and the final chase scene."
"545",5,"  Amazing, exciting, and stunning. Spielberg did it again."
"546",1,"  Very disappointed... not sure why there is such a high rating. Bad acting, bad adaptation of the book, and thin characters. Made for a painful watching experience, save for an exciting moment here or there."
"547",1,"  Cliche story with poorly written world, bland characters with awful dialogue, forgettable action scenes (except for maybe the first one) and almost no soundtrack. A surprisingly unfun and cringe movie. Spielberg really didn't try very hard on this one."
"548",4,"  It was fun to watch."
"549",4,"  Great movie! Saw it this weekend, good family-ish movie with the now required for a PG-13 movie single F-bomb. I did not read the book, but according to the person behind us, "" it was nothing like the book!"" All in all a fun movie and worth seeing."
"550",4,"  Full disclosure, I did NOT read the book...yet. Ready Player One is a movie tailored to a generation. I sat there and watched countless references to games, movies, TV shows, and books of old zip past me in a rush of nostalgia. It was fun! I grew up in the thick of all this material, so seeing it on the silver screen in some form had me giddy. And while this was all good fun, the story does not suffer (too much) with the saturation of call-backs. However, for someone like my father who sat next to me and probably didn't have the slightest clue as to what many of the newer references were (outside the movies or books), he was still able to give me the stamp of approval, ""it was better than I expected.""Steven Spielberg has made it a habit to excel with kid/teenage actors and stories that circulate around them. Yet again, we find ourselves following another teen, Wade Watts, in his battle for the future. Set in 2045, we get a future dystopian society, which resembles something more of what we see today with all the Virtual Reality headsets and technology than I think Spielberg wants you to think. While the actual Oasis itself is far fetched from a technical standpoint, kids these days are already part of a massive multiplayer online experience. Spielberg is only reinforcing values and stigmas in this fictional world that we currently see today, and his not-so-subtle message toward the end about staying grounded in reality instead of wandering infinitely in the VR world feels like a parental word of guidance rather than a command.The acting is marginally forgettable. Tye Sheridan is a bit stiff and doesn't quite come off as the full-fledged nerd we are supposed to believe him to be. Olivia Cooke offers a bit more personality as the first supporting character. Ben Mendelsohn is born to play villains hot off the heels from his Rogue One performance from a few years ago and Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg only bolster the otherwise unknown cast.So while the acting isn't necessarily why you come to see RPO, the CGI and effects certainly are the reason. They are flawless. I saw it in 3D. It's not Avatar (has anything really ever matched that?), but for a 'video game' movie, this had all the added bonuses of seeing everything in crisp, clear, 3D rendering. There's almost a point when you feel the movie coming to a close after the climactic boss battle where you wish another hour of just references took place. Too many to list. So while RPO offers up tons of nostalgia to the right people, it still gives you a solid movie to boot even if you can't recognize every single reference over the slightly long 2 hour and 20 minute run time. Spielberg's filmography is chock full of adventures like this, and this is just another solid staple to pin his name to."
"551",5,"  This movie basically represents my childhood. I fell in love with it the minute I saw the opening credits. This movie had everything, and it was spectacular. I wish there are more movies like this in the future."
"552",3.5,"  Good not Great. I did enjoy the movie but I just felt like it was missing something. Overall it is a fun movie and visually it will blow you away. I just never felt like I understood how it felt to live in the world of the oasis. Needed more scenes like the shinning and the club. Go watch it you will be happy you did on the big screen."
"553",1.5,"  The endless stream of references made the movie seem cheesy and really devoid of any substance. That was a bit confusing to me considering that one of the things that I loved about the book was the endless stream of references; however, having a couple of days to reflect on it, I realized that the difference in my reactions to the references in the movie and the book really boils down to the fact that the references were a major plot point in the book. In the book, you can't solve Halliday's puzzles without a very deep knowledge of 70s and 80s pop/nerd culture. The puzzles are all about knowing how to win a certain video game or run through a specific D&D module. Thus the fact that the characters put so much stock in having nerd cred makes sense in the books and thus doesn't come off as vapid pandering. Having nerd cred could net you in excess of half a trillion dollars and control of the Oasis. Any of you would learn the shit out of a video game if you thought it would help you earn half a trillion dollars.In the movie, the references play a much smaller (almost non-existent) role in winning Halliday's prize. With the exception of the final key, all of the challenges are focused on knowing Halliday himself - having intimate knowledge of his regrets and desires. Spielberg picked up on one small mention of Halliday having a love interest in the book and blew it up into Halliday's single most important character trait for the film. This strips many of the references of their necessary context and makes them come off as unnecessary pandering. They are cheesy. The only remotely entertaining reference involved the use of Chucky as a WMD.On the surface the book is about nostalgia; however, it's not about mindless nostalgia. One of the most brilliant things that Kline did was to turn nostalgia into a plot device through which he could explore nerd culture (both of the past and the future) and re-imagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in a new futuristic setting. He brought that morality tale - a tale of overcoming corporate greed and valuing relationships - into the 21st century using the 20th century as a plot device to develop deeper connections with his own childhood as well as with his readers."
"554",4,"  A crossover to end all crossovers. So about 25 years into the future, being online has developed an entirely new meaning altogether. Instead of being connected to others via the internet, there is the Oasis, which takes your online presence to a whole new level. When the brainchild behind it all (Mark Rylance) passes, he posthumously releases an announcement that all of his control and stock of this giant conglomerate is up for grabs for the person who can find three Easter eggs within the Oasis. Enter our protagonist, Wade (Tye Sheridan), who has his eye on the prize. Now there has been about as much buzz as there can be surrounding the creation of this. It is based on a beloved book that fans feel very passionately about, and it features as many licensed properties that have ever been on film at the same time. Also, it is the return of the Spielberg blockbuster, and the last time he made a movie that was even a little bit like this, it went by the name Indiana Jones. If you ever saw The Adventures of Tintin, you already know that Spielberg never really lost it, and he has once again made another roller coaster ride with Ready Player One. To further enhance my experience, I got to see this in 3-D and in D-Box (I probably wouldn't have sprung for this, but I wasn't the one buying the tickets). While I will say that the 3-D in this is clear and never dark, I can still take it or leave it at the end of the day. What I did really enjoy was the immersive D-Box experience, as it made me feel like I was on a ride at Universal Studios. For a movie that sells itself on being a roller coaster ride, it really is the way to go, and you can bet money that this is how I will be enjoying the next Fast & Furious movie. Regardless, I know you don't care about that, you just want to know how the movie is. Well, I don't think I have seen a movie out there that plays on your nostalgia harder than this one does here, and that's either going to work for you or it's not. This could have very well have been named Easter Egg: The Movie, and I think it is physically impossible to catch every single nudge, wink and reference in this, or at the very least not on the first time watching it. If you're the right audience, it's going to make you geek out (there is a perfect scene at the midpoint of this that I refuse to spoil), and the only other movie that I think even attempted a crossover this ambitious was Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and even then, it wasn't to this extent. With so much of this being CGI, I was worried we were going to get something like World of Warcraft. Rest assured, it is way better than that, and this is far more accessible. I will say that I feel that whenever the story is outside of the Oasis, the characters come off as being one-dimensional and a bit flat. This just makes it so you just want to dive right back in. It doesn't hinder the story too much, but it does make it so there's not a ton of depth, and if that was there, this could have potentially became an instant classic. As it stands, it's still worth checking out big in a theater, and even though you do feel the length, it is always well-paced with tons happening any given frame so that you never get bored."
"555",5,"  Great movie from start to finish!!"
"556",5,"  Completely different than the book, but all the major plot points are there and it was damn entertaining!"
"557",5,"  Easily the best film of 2018, needs more than one watch to catch all the references and is a fun ride throughout"
"558",4,"  Loved it all the way through!!!! It was just great!"
"559",4.5,"  Unbelievable movie. Loved it. Incredible visuals and writing. Must see!"
"560",5,"  Visual treat, keeps your engaged 100% of the time."
"561",5,"  Great pop culture movie"
"562",4.5,"  Really good movie with satisfying ending."
"563",3.5,"  A fast-paced action thriller with an explosion of pop-culture references and heartwarming nostalgic moments for the young and the old alike. Although the Steven Spielberg effect is no longer as vivid as in his previous works, it is an universally accepted fact that he is still kicking ass in the film industry."
"564",4.5,"  The movie has a fantastic story and unbelievable visuals. The ride started strong and got better with each scene and each clue. This is like the National Treasure of video games. Mystery, fun, entertainment, and a great story about how games can bring people together, but its just as important to have real connections with people outside of games."
"565",5,"  10/10 would watch again and again and again"
"566",3,"  Well it was not exactly like the book, which I will admit kind if crushed me at first. But as the film went on I took my boyfriend's advise and tried to separate the movie from the book. So after that I started to appreciate the film a little more and see the metophors of not being afraid to live your life in the real world, it kind of grew on me. But I felt movie wise, the charater development in the beginning was way to short and we didn't get enough time to get a feel for why Wade Watts is so special and deserves to win the contest. Overall, it was pretty good and I enjoyed the animation."
"567",0.5,"  this looks like this a movie for PREVIOUS generation, who saw and REMEMBER old movies like shining and others. got bored when you do not understand what the jokes are about"
"568",5,"  This movie was so much fun! Loved the nostalgia and all of the easter eggs that were thrown in. The cast was great, Spielberg threw in regular (recently) Mark Rylance, and somewhat up and coming's Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke (she is great). Ben Mendelsohn is always really good as a villain. And obviously the visuals and special effects looked great in this movie. It is one of the main pulls other than the nostalgia. I have no complaints regarding this movie. 5 stars from me."
"569",4,"  Books to movies will always disappoint certain viewers, so I don't even know why people who read them watch them, because they are never happy. I LOVED this! As a gamer myself, I love seeing all the games come to life, but most of all, I love the story. I think it was great! I loved this movie! I will be seeing this again!"
"570",3.5,"  This feels like a fresh take on the sci-fi genre. Spielberg seems to be becoming a master of the CG world. The story line can be a little uninspiring, but what it lacks in plot it certainly makes up for with visuals. You'll need to know a few pop culture references to be full involved, but put on your VR Goggles and step into OASIS."
"571",2,"  Book was better. This should have been adapted into a 4 part Netflix mini movie series. Keeping Spielberg at the helm with less changing the story."
"572",4.5,"  I think anyone who grew up around the pop culture icons of film and the gaming industry of the 80s and early 90s should enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend seeing this film on the largest screen you can find and in 3D if that's your thing. I personally saw it the first time in Imax 3D and loved it. Definitely will see it again. Won't win any awards for plot or acting, but that's not what I was looking for at all. I wanted a shiny, action filled blast from my past and was not let down at all. I haven't read the book yet and have heard from friends that there are some changes that effect the story some.. but overall you get the general idea.Good enough acting, great visuals and soundtrack, fun. I would and have recommended this movie to friends.Remember, it's just a movie. :) Have fun!"
"573",5,"  THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF 2018 SO FAR! THIS HAS GREAT CHARACTERS AND AMAZING VISUALS BUT THE GREATEST ASPECT IS THE POP-CULTURE REFERENCES. THE DIRECTIONS ARE TOP NOTCH AND THE ACTING IS PERFECT. THIS HILARIOUS AND ASTONISHING ADVENTURE IS ONE TO REMEMBER AND ONE TO SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN (I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SEEING IT IN THE IMAX) I WOULD GIVE THIS A VERY WELL DESERVED 100%!"
"574",4,"  Based on the 2011 novel by Ernest Cline, Ready Player One marks a much-welcome return to science fiction blockbuster fare for Steven Spielberg, a genre he'd helped bring to the public consciousness over the years with movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., Jurassic Park and Minority Report. The fact that some of those works had served as inspiration for the source material only makes his choice as director here a no-brainer.The year is 2045, and our protagonist Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) lives in the slums of Columbus, Ohio, known here as the stacks for the way its various mobile homes and trailers are stacked upon one another in true shanty town manner. Everyday life in the stacks is tough, and rather than face those challenges head on, Wade takes refuge in a virtual reality world called the OASIS, where he takes the form of his avatar, Parzival. It is a world of limitless possibilities, and one with the promise of a very special reward.Following the death of its creator, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), a message is broadcast to all users of the OASIS, revealing an elaborate Easter Egg hunt. In order to complete the hunt, players must complete three tasks while gathering clues from Halliday's past, a past that is heavily steeped in a love of 80s and 90s pop culture. The first person that discovers the Easter Egg would not only inherit Halliday's riches, but also assume complete control of the OASIS itself. And thus began the hunt for the Easter Egg, a hunt that's been going on for 5 years when the movie opens.Parzival is one of the many gunters (that's short for egg hunters) looking for the egg, and he is joined on this quest by best friend, Aech (Lena Waithe), love interest, Art3mis (Oliva Cooke), and fellow gunters, Daito (Win Morisaki) and Sho (Philip Zao). They'd collective come to be known as the high five when they manage to beat the first task after Parzival cracks the clue hidden in one of Halliday's many recordings. This puts them on the radar of Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), CEO of IOI, a company that is willing to go to any lengths to gain control of the OASIS.Much like last year's Blade Runner 2049, Ready Player One is a film worth experiencing on the largest available screen. I saw it in IMAX, and looking back, I can't imagine seeing it in any other format. The film is a visual spectacle; everything from the highspeed thrills of the first task, to the breathtaking final battle that surrounded the third one manages to one-up everything that came before. Even the quieter moments of the second task remains noteworthy for its photorealistic recreation of the Overlook Hotel from the Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick horror classic, The Shining.Ready Player One isn't merely a love letter to pop culture and video game history. It is a celebration of blockbuster filmmaking. It is Steven Spielberg proving once again that he knows how to dazzle with awe-inspiring visuals and action that put the Michael Bays of this world to shame. The fact that none of that comes at the expense of a thought-provoking narrative is icing on an already-delicious cake."
"575",3.5,"  Spielberg in good form. He is NOT Michael Bay."
"576",4,"  Separate the book from the movie. See it on the biggest and loudest screen possible."
"577",5,"  Absolutely loved this movie. As soon as I finished it, I got online and downloaded the book!"
"578",5,"  ""Ready Player One"" is definetly a movie that you must see on the biggest screen that you can experience. Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, and Mark Rylance gave such excellent performances. While the movie isn't character driven, but they're still likeable. Alan Silvestri has create a darn good score, as it reminded me the old days of Silvestri since he did the ""Back to the Future"" movies and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" The visuals are top notch, and it was cool seeing the Delorean and the Iron Giant to be in the movie. Steven Spielberg has done a heck of a job to adapt Ernest Cline's book into a movie, and really has made something that is pure entertainment and a world of pure imagination. See it on the biggest screen, and you'll have a wonderful time at the movies. Love this movie!"
"579",2.5,"  Disappointing story. The effects and pop culture references made it worth watching but aside from that there's not much to be taken from the plot. Runtime is also too long making it hard to sit through."
"580",5,"  Great film. If you are not looking for a deep story and psychological thriller or something. If you still can dream and just like adventures - highly recommended."
"581",4,"  EÃ©n van de meest verfrissende films die ik in tijden gezien heb. Een berg aan referenties aan oude muziek, videogames en films Ã©n dat allemaal bekeken in Dolby Cinema. Wat een verschil. Wat een verbetering!"
"582",2,"  the adaptation from book to movie was very unimpressive, so many important scenes were left out and replaced with disappointing scenes. i dont know how people who dont have the book as a backstory can watch this and understand the plot at all"
"583",5,"  Ready player One is the best action movie I have seen in Avatar . This movie filled with good writing , CGI and it got everything you need in good cinematic experience . Score is not level . If someone ask me why should I watch this movie my simple reply is , Are u fed up with this super hero and franchise driven movies where you have to wait for years for the next movie to come and never giving the best ending we want , you must go see Ready Player One its is the comprehensive movie experience that you dreamed of"
"584",4,"  Pure Spielberg magic, brings out the kid in you."
"585",5,"  WOW! Orgasm after Orgasm. I wanted more so much more, give me more. Spielberg is WOW! Just I cant even describe what I felt. WOW 2nd key challenge WOW! Im ah ggr yea dont even understand what happen. WOW! AMzing... jAhahah I could not stop my smile. Definitely top 5 of my all time movies. Bravo everybody involved with this movie. Thank you for turning my week around. I went and saw this beauty twice. Thank you."
"586",4,"  READY PLAYER ONE is excessively busy and may not have made the best designs for King Kong, Mechagodzilla and various other characters but does make for a great film in telling us not to rely and depend on online video games and technology too much in foregoing real world analogous problems because that message was well delivered. When this movie began, everyone was living in a highly polluted and smog-thick planet that was environmentally ruined and their economy was dead but they turned to OASIS for comfort and taking a break from real life problems instead of actually doing something about it - thus making it so much easier for tyranny, greedy capitalist entrepreneurs and dictatorship to take over. And so in the end (right after 2 hours of pure video games turned into a movie) the main character decides to ban OASIS on Tuesdays and Thursdays not to take away our freedom, but to ensure we keep a grip on our freedom.I did not like the idea of Mechagodzilla fighting Iron Giant because there's nothing so spectacular about mixing in characters from completely different cultures. The only thing that can take down Mechagodzilla is the true Godzilla himself. Also, Mechagodzilla did not come looking out great in the movie but I'm sort of glad at least Ready Player One put Mechagodzilla back on the big screen, TOHO hasn't been using him since 2003."
"587",0.5,"  I am embarrassed for everyone involved in this train wreck."
"588",5,"  Best movie I've seen this year so far!"
"589",2,"  The movie did not make justice to the book. The story changed quite a lot, and not for the better. When I read the book, I was captivated by each character of the high five, felt sorry for Halliday, cheered for Ogden, and admired Anorak. The movie, however, shows exceptional graphics. Just because this movie had an amazing director, it does not make it GOOD. READ THE BOOK..... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. ** BOOK AND MOVIE SPOILER ALERT **Story line was terrible in the movie and lack emotion throughout. It felt fast paced. I sat through the end hoping for the last scene: when anorak transfer his powers, and Parzival uses them to kill Sorento."
"590",4.5,"  Marvelous and imaginative director Steven Spielberg and Ernest Cline's story of a near future nowI creating a film full of nostalgia, 80s and what is to be one of 2018's best films"
"591",5,"  What a movie ! Hands down amazing ! Never bored!!"
"592",3.5,"  Different from the book, but doesn't detract from the book. This is an adaptation, but it mostly gets things right, especially the charm and the spirit of the quest. Worth a see in theatres, and I'm happy I shelled out the extra coin for 3D."
"593",4,"  Given the potential storylines of the film, I understand why some people were disappointed. However, for the vision the creators had for it, I believe it was an above average execution. This film tested boundaries and took risks that I think paid off overall but will undoubtedly leave some disappointed who had a preconceived expectation. Was it perfect, no. Was it worth my time and money, 100%."
"594",2,"  All spectacle, zero heart, and unfortunately the additons and subtractions didn't quite balance each other out. Not Speilbergs best work by far. Watch it on a big screen and try not wince at the bad pacing."
"595",5,"  One of my favorite movies I've seen in a very long time!"
"596",2,"  Not an awful movie, but if you don't see it I don't think you're missing much. The visuals are nice, the plot is lack-luster. A lot of the depth from the book is glossed over on the movie. A lot of the themes the movie raises aren't really explored. Largely seems like a missed opportunity. If you love nostalgia and pop culture references, this may be for you. But if you don't think of the 80s as the greatest decade ever, you may just not care about this."
"597",4.5,"  I am going to preface this review by saying this movie is very niche. It requires a remarkable amount of knowledge of 80s pop culture along with gaming past and present. Since I am well versed in both these areas I had a blast. Despite the movie trailing pretty far from the book it still kept the overall charm intact. The performers all played their parts perfectly and the story moved along at a very good pace. As I mentioned earlier the star of this show was the references or ""easter eggs."" If you looked away for just a second odds are you missed one. From 80s toys and music to old video games, I can't even imagine how much WB had to pay for licensing. I especially enjoyed the homage they made to The Shining. My rating could have easily been a solid 5//5, but I had to take half a star away to recognize it is not a film for everyone."
"598",3.5,"  Don't expect something clever, just get some popcorn and enjoy the ride."
"599",4.5,"  The story didn't have much going for it. The whole relationship between the two main characters felt underdeveloped but this movie wins in visuals and nostalgia. One of the best looking movies I have ever seen and even if a movie is trash the visuals can bring it back for me. I will probably be seeing it again."
"600",3,"  This would've been a 5 Star movie if I had not read the book"
"601",3.5,"  In Ready Player One, the endless joy of color, visuals, and pop culture references eventually win over the rocky storytelling and missed opportunities"
"602",5,"  I've actually never rated a movie before but i felt like I should on this one! Go watch it! My wife didn't want to see it but she actually ended up really liking it. It's a great movie and worth your money and time!"
"603",4,"  Just ignore the plotholes and revel in the pop culture references. The story is full of heart, puzzles, and red herrings. Enjoy the ride."
"604",3.5,"  Equal parts cringy and cool, Ready Player One is Spielberg's most fun film in years."
"605",1,"  thanks spielberg for taking my favorite book and turning it into my least favorite movie. next time dont change 90% of a books plot"
"606",5,"  Best movie so far this year, Pure Nostalgic fun and excitement!"
"607",5,"  Marvelous and imaginative director Steven Spielberg and Ernest Cline's story of a near future nowI creating a film full of nostalgia, 80s and what is to be one of 2018's best films"
"608",4,"  Gain 1 internet point for every reference you get!"
"609",2,"  Nice throwbacks, bad conflict lines."
"610",4,"  This movie is indeed a mess, but messy can be fun. Requires multiple viewings to fully adjust to a lasting opinion on this movie, but it was a very entertaining ride from start to finish."
"611",0.5,"  Complete garbage! The book is geared toward 80s kids and this peice of shit is for kids and preteens. There is no depth to the story and a lot of it doesn't make any sense."
"612",2.5,"  The Matrix for teens (and 80's aficionados)."
"613",5,"  Ready Player One Movie is a perfect love letter to those 80s and 90s kids, loving and growing up with fun pop culture!! Stephen Spielberg is a genius for developing another classic film that includes tons of fantastic classic video games and movies references and so much more!! We totally loved it! =)"
"614",2,"  So if you read the book....save that memory and DON'T ruin it with the movie. Spielberg should not have directed this..was not a good fit. Every fantastic feeling that the book invoked through nostalgia was a complete miss with the movie. I am sure it was quite enjoyable if you didn't love the book."
"615",5,"  Exciting and fun to watch with the family"
"616",5,"  My new favorite movie"
"617",4.5,"  In my opinion i thought the story was good I liked the characters, their evolution as people and the ending was interesting."
"618",4.5,"  Fun movie. Good for kids 8 or 9+"
"619",4,"  I had a great time watching it. However, I will note that its not perfect. I ended up seeing in theaters twice because I had such a good time."
"620",5,"  Another great movie from a great director."
"621",4.5,"  I want an Oasis to hang out in, this movie shows what VR could really be like, for better and worse."
"622",4,"  Fantastic visuals, great story line, and pays homage to several 80s greats. Let down slightly by the lack of depth about the depressing world of the future."
"623",4,"  Though Not Accurate with the Source Material Yet Still Sporting it's Playful Spirit, Ready Player One is a Wickedly Fun, Heartfelt, and Exciting Adaptation of A Great Novel From One Of The Most Treasured Storytellers of Our Time."
"624",5,"  Realmente impresionada."
"625",4,"  Fantastic movie. Does the book justice - changes that are made makes sense in order to translate the book into a film. Really enjoyable, paced well, great special effects. thumps up!!"
"626",4.5,"  Just a rippin' great time at the movies. Outstanding references to 80's pop culture, honoring and celebrating American heritage ... guaranteed to drive the loony SWJ utterly bat shit crazy. Loved this movie, take that Star Wars The Last Joke."
"627",5,"  Great movie, loved it"
"628",2.5,"  I wanted to like Ready Player One more than I did. I've owned the book for a while, but just never managed to read it - based on reviews I've read, that might be a good thing as the movie seems to let some readers down more than I was.It's hard to not be more enthused about a Spielberg movie. This just never really felt like a Speilberg movie to me. It just seemed too rushed and too flashy... don't get me wrong, Uncle Steven can - and has done flashy and movies that made you feel like you were on the edge of your seat. This just felt overdone and more concerned with sensory overload than it did anything else.Ready Player One could be a new Willie Wonka - however, rather than the lessons we learned in from Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca and the rest - we get a basic badguy with basic badguy army looking for (cyber) world domination.Ready Player One tries so hard to get us to care about this fake world by delving into the history of the its creator. Unfortunately, those are the most human moments we get out of this one. Our leading characters don't have a hint of that type of a character arc this movie needed.I am hopeful another viewing might help like this one a little more than I did. Ready Player One is still a roller coaster ride with some great moments that is a lot of fun at times and well worth watching in a theater for the shock and awe value alone."
"629",1.5,"  If you are a fan of this book, don't see this movie. You will be HUGELY disappointed. Just go read the book again. Not sure how they took such an incredible story and turned it into this disaster, but it's tragic. The massive changes to the Aech and Art3mis characters alone are enough to skip the movie."
"630",4,"  Overall this movie is great, it has elements from the book that makes it amazing. However there are plot holes in the movie and it moves a bit to fast. If you're looking for a book to film adaption then you will be disappointed, but if you're willing to look past the fact that it's not a book to film adaptation then over all it's a good movie."
"631",5,"  Fun movie, good for the whole family!"
"632",5,"  Most of the scenes are Intense, No Drama, Super Hack-Slash. No Movies could copy this movie, also a great lesson to learn for generation these days."
"633",5,"  Saw it 30 minutes ago and would gladly turn around and see it again, loved all the references to pop culture as well as the overall plot of it, and its relate-ability"
"634",5,"  Great movie! CGI was probably the greatest since Avatar. The plot is a bit repetitive, but not that bad. The message was very powerful. Nice culture references, good acting, and overall, worth seeing."
"635",5,"  An instant classic. Spielberg delivers a near perfect piece of nostalgic entertainment that is still set very much in the future."
"636",5,"  I took the kids to see the movie they absolutely loved it I have to admit I was entertained from beginning to end. A must see!"
"637",4.5,"  In the lead up to the release of the film Spielberg himself wanted to stress to his audience that this was a movie, not a film. Basically meaning a spectacle film like Jurassic Park or Jaws or Indiana Jones, not like his brilliant thought pieces like Schindler's List or The Colour Purple. This is a popcorn film to sit down and be engrossed in the visuals and fun story it wants to tell. Without spoiling it I will say this film delivers.On the surface it delivers a story not all that different from young adult dystopian dramas like Hunger Games or Divergent, where it excels is its tone. Whether you are in the real world of the virtual Oasis this film never takes itself too seriously, while we care about the plight of our heroes and the stakes of what will happen if they don't succeed, everything is done with a dose of humour and levity. The film seems to work perfectly as almost a sci-fi fairytale of evil villains and mighty heroes, the Oasis is the perfect back drop for such a story.Spielberg has shown here that there is a right way to make a big budget blockbuster that is entertaining from start to finish without resorting to over the top drivel like what is so common in recent franchises like Transformers, Fast and Furious and even, I dare say, my beloved DC Comics films.Don't come into this film expecting an academy award winning think piece, come in looking to be entertained and enthralled, you will not be disappointed."
"638",4.5,"  Even though Black Panther was incredible, Ready Player One is excitement I really want to revisit. One of Spielberg's best films since the 90s."
"639",5,"  Out of this world cool. Amazing action scenes."
"640",5,"  Great movie for the family and anyone that loves video games"
"641",4,"  It's a great movie, gives me a lot of that 70's 80's adventure or quest vibe from older movies. While it has a 'Willy Wonka' flavor, it's easily more than ""Willy Wonka but with video games'. The references are amusing but tend to not be the crux of the movie, so if you don't get a reference the movie doesn't leave you out to dry.That's the thing, if the movie had 'no' references, it would still be a great movie, but the other stuff just made it seem more connected to our world. It's not perfect, the story itself is thin but more in the way that it's simplistic and easy to follow.It's a great movie that I think will age like Rodger Rabbit, it can hold up on its own even when more and more people are too young to get it's references."
"642",5,"  Briliant movie, just go to the cinemas and enjoy for yourself. As less you know about the movie, the better you enjoy. Stop reading Reviews and be part of the incredible world that Spielberg, Cline and Penn created."
"643",1,"  What did they do to Artemis? This was horrible. They ruined it. The guy next to me kept groaning and putting his head in his hands. I watched the entire thing only because I paid a fortune for an imax 3d movie.. would it have killed them to have a fat actress? And why was H given so little screen time in the real world? Artemis is a smaller character then H. They should have left out the resistance, there were so many amazing things in the book and they needed to make things up. This is barely better than the Eragon debacle. READ THE BOOK, SKIP THE MOVIE."
"644",4.5,"  My only question as of just getting home from the theater, how did they afford all the licences for the Easter Eggs? There are at least 100 different specifically named/pictured other IP's in this movie lolMy only complaint is the love story between Wade and Samantha seems a tad forced. (Plus lets be honest its a trope as old as writing itself.Gotta subvert tropes like that, turn them on their heads some how.)"
"645",5,"  really a good movie ever"
"646",1,"  Why..... why did you do this to me Steven? Ernest Kline wrote a killer a story and I fell in love with it. You came in and ripped it all to shreds, said sorry and tried to tape it back together with shitty scotch tape, but forgot how the original was put together so you decided to add and remove key parts of the original. I feel dead inside."
"647",4.5,"  Entertaining from start to finish, no real parts of the movie where I felt disengaged. Sure the story is a little cheesy but hey it was fun."
"648",4.5,"  Ready Player One is just a perfect celebration of pop culture that will make you want to be part of it. With a really talented cast and intelligent references that definitely will make you nostalgic. Spielberg will bring you back to the 80´s."
"649",1.5,"  As a stand alone film it's fine but as a fan of the book this film fell painfully short, the basic theme remained but it failed to utilize any of story elements, opting instead to replace the real story with flashy filler"
"650",5,"  best movie i ever seen so far"
"651",5,"  Best movie I have seen in 2018! Spielbergs is the bomb!"
"652",5,"  This Is Every Fan Boy's Dream! Filled with References from Pop Culture this will make every fanboy skeet in their pants!"
"653",0.5,"  I wish I could rate lower. This movie relies on the quality of better cultural pieces before it, while adding nothing. The characters were empty, the animation was uninspired, and the concept of an world where anything goes is not new, and this movie doesn't do anything new with the concept."
"654",2,"  This movie was better than the atrocious book. If you love high school, acne and teenage angst, this movie and book are for you.Speilberg was asleep at the wheel here, focused on technical mastery without any heart whatsoever. We don't care about any of the characters, and find their struggles to be just a giant boring cartoon.Save your money, ignore this movie and the book, too."
"655",5,"  Amazing, I love the movie."
"656",5,"  Spielberg does it again! I would say, though, that if you are over the age of about 40, you may not enjoy it. But that's only if you don't like insanely good CGI and tons of action. Although it has a somewhat sexual part and has some language, I would still say it's a movie that most of that family could enjoy."
"657",4.5,"  Exelent movie, brutal effects///spanish: Excelente es muy buena pelÃ­cula totalmente recomendable y no solo para milenials por que tambiÃ©n aparecen referencias de lo 80 y 90, ademas de los juegos, consolas y tendencias de ahora"
"658",3,"  To be fair, you have to have aÂ veryÂ high IQ to understand Ready Player One. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of video games most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Parzival's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from the video game series Final Fantasy, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to trulyÂ appreciateÂ the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Ready Player One truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Parzival's existencial catchphrase ""You're full of shit"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Activision's video game epicÂ Call Of Duty.Â I'm smirking right now justÂ imaginingÂ one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Steven Spielberg's genius unfolds itself on their theater screens. What fools... how IÂ pityÂ them. ?? And yes by the way, I DO have a Ready Player One tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
"659",2.5,"  I was really looking forward to this movie and knew that they wouldn't be able to get everything that was in the book. I was amazed though that they completely changed the storyline from the book. The main idea is the same, but none of the challenges and much of the plot line are different. It might as well have been based on a different book, in my opinion. Overall the movie is entertaining, but I left extremely disappointed and thought they really missed the mark on this one."
"660",5,"  I grew up on games. Video games shaped my childhood. This movie? Brings back all the old and all the new with everything from old arcade games to Overwatch. The reality in this movie is every baker's wet dream. Perfectly tied with nerdiness and nostalgia and the rush of adventure in exploring a new game... best movie I've seen in years."
"661",5,"  Nostalgia at every turn, great visuals, gripping story, great movie!"
"662",4,"  Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan) who lives in the year 2045 spends most of his time in virtual reality in a world called the OASIS. The creator of the OASIS, James Haliday, leaves an Easter Egg (which we learn about after he dies) for one of his players to find where the prize is his fortune and complete control of this wonderful virtual place. Wade and his friends, known as the High Five, take on the adventure to find the special prize but they are pursued and targeted by many enemies.I gave this movie 4 stars, I really enjoyed it. I thought it showed the audience two completely different worlds that were both equally well done yet it still felt like one movie. Nothing felt disconnected between real world and virtual and things flowed very nicely.In the virtual world, it was great that the story showed how anonymous we can be in that environment. It doesn't matter how you were raised, where you live, how you look or what you are interested in. Wade and all the characters in the High Five are great examples of normal kids, even from poor backgrounds that had great followings and great experiences in the OASIS.Lots of unexpected things happen in this movie. A few parts were not appropriate for very young kids but being 16 and seeing it with my mom and other adults I would say this would make a great movie to see with the family. It's quite an adventure."
"663",5,"  i don't know most of the references in this movie, but it was very entertaining and a whole lot of fun. There were moments that completely wowed me, i did not expect anything. Thanks for a good time!"
"664",5,"  This was the movie that my childhood was waiting for."
"665",4,"  This was actually pretty good!!!!"
"666",3,"  I would of given this 4 stars, but it had to loose a star because the movie pretty much cut-out everything that made the book so unique (80s pop culture). Instead it tries to make 20 somethings interested in seeing movie by throwing in 90s and 00s pop crap (halo and iron giant), so now it's just a vanilla sci-fi flick. Still a fun, well acted, directed, popcorn flick, but without the central plot of the book, it's forgettable."
"667",2.5,"  Not as bad a re-write as the Dark Tower, but close."
"668",3,"  Whilst is follows the typical 'heroes journey' formula to the letter in three acts, this was a great film to go see with the kids. The adults spend all their time looking at the multitude of pop culture references, where there are ones the kids can pick up on too, they will mostly watch the story. A good examination of how people are rapidly escaping reality in the virtual world that we have created, and it also sent a strong warning to kids about giving away clues to your real identity online, ands the consequences of this. It had the usual messages about corporatisation of the virtual world, and keeping it free for the people. I liked it as I think all these messages are important, and it was pure escapism for the duration of the film, even though it was simplistic. Worth a watch"
"669",5,"  interesante, son demasiados cambios con respecto al libro pero se respeta la esencia del mismo."
"670",4,"  I came in with low expectations, but Ready Player One was consistently entertaining from beginning to end. Too much exposition and forced character dialogue hold a fun and competently-made film back from being truly great."
"671",5,"  Very surprised with this film! I?m into pop culture and gaming so this was a no brainer for me, but I also brought my girlfriend along who really isn?t into that stuff. I could almost say she liked it more than I did. I would highly recommend watching this movie."
"672",5,"  this movie is amazing if you are a super 80s nerd like me go see this movie"
"673",5,"  Damn right five stars. Steven Spielberg did it again. He created so many iconic films that are now classic Jaws, ET, Jurassic Park, Schindler's list and man many more (no these are not all Spielberg's films I know) but with this one he added another iconic film to his resume .... great greaaaaat fun."
"674",5,"  If you grew up in the '80s and were technically-oriented and/or played AD&D or other games, this is the movie for you."
"675",5,"  Loved it! So fun! I read the book a few years ago and it's still my favorite. I thought the differences between the book & the movie were cool. To me, it added more to the story- like having alternate endings. I'll be watching this again & again!"
"676",3.5,"  3.5/5JAMES CAMERON: ... Hold my beer."
"677",5,"  Absolutely fabulous ! One of the most clever - well organized - fast moving films I've seen in a while - You MUST see this in 3D !!! Technically amazing - from start to finish - the special effects were unbelievable... the characters were extremely well developed- lots of plot twists and turns - Very uplifting - inspiring- and humorous - Loved it enough to go back and see it again !! Certain portions reminded me slightly of Avatar ... but faster paced Highly recommend!!"
"678",5,"  Incredible spectacle! There are scenes in the first half that took my breath away. The soundtrack to this film was written by Back to the Future composer Alan Silvestri and it's fantastic. Loved it ?? ?? ?? ?? ??"
"679",5,"  Very entertaining and has a great storyline with next gen-graphics"
"680",5,"  Cuando el creador odia a su creación... Oh YEAH!!!"
"681",5,"  2000 times better than Last Jedi Garbage"
"682",5,"  ""Ready Player One"" is a good time at the movies. The story has familiarities with any classic adventure movie, so no real surprises.The movie will have less of an impact for people not deeply moved or deeply affected by film/game culture although they should be entertained by the sheer awesomeness of the visuals, the tie-in of the video-game world with the real world, and for the reflection of today's technology (and tomorrow's aspiring technology) in entertainment/life. I recommend this movie because it's the Spielberg magical experience with his quality story-telling using the source material of our modern world and potential future!"
"683",2.5,"  Besides all huge special effects, this movie was awful! The characters are flat and two dimensional, that once you get pass all the 80s 90s references you are left with plotline that has one key ingredient missing - a soul. Which I guess is the point of the movie, which is for humanity to give up on planet earth and submit to living life in a cheap mindless version of it through VR."
"684",2.5,"  Continuing an unfortunate tradition that has come to characterize many of his recent films, director Steven Spielberg's latest big-budget bloated extravaganza dazzles visually but grows tiresome (some might even say exasperating) rather quickly. The picture plays like a glitzy, nostalgic stroll down an '80s version of memory lane, chock full of nonstop references to the decade's movies. music and memes (in itself an odd fascination for characters in a story set in 2045). What's worse, the film lacks a fundamentally compelling story and takes about 45 minutes too long to get to a central message that becomes patently obvious early on in the picture. If you're looking for purely mindless entertainment, you'll probably find this moderately amusing, but, if you want something more substantive, skip this one and watch one of the filmmaker's earlier (and much better) offerings."
"685",4,"  Honest entertainment that doesnt seem to care delivering more than the throwback euphoria for all millenial movie fans and it doesnt have to. SS is better at doing this kind of stuff. Would watch again."
"686",5,"  Wow this movie was awesome. I was geeking out through the whole thing. All the Easter eggs, the graphics, the story. 10/10. The ultimate movie for gamers!"
"687",5,"  One of the best book to movie adaptations I've ever seen!"
"688",4.5,"  Fantastic! The book is one of my favorites of all time and even though they had some significant departures I thought it was all done in the spirit of Cline's vision. The CGI was unbelievable and the acting was superb. Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn were great, also strong performances from Sheridan and Waithe."
"689",5,"  While a good bit different than the book, it captures the essence very well none the less. Spielberg adjustments probably made it a better movie"
"690",5,"  My advice to one and all is see the movie, then read or listen to the book. The movie was/is great but if you have read the book first and are dissapointed understand they did the best they could. However if you have NOT read the book WAIT see the movie and than read or listen to the book and it will be so much better for you."
"691",3,"  Having read the book I was looking very much forward to seeing the movie . The movie stands on its own. It really is not the story we all read in the book. There were some nostalgic references and music but nothing to the extent of what it should or could have been. The storyline was very much diluted and most of what I liked about the book was lost. If you haven't read the book and especially if you are a gamer you probably wiill enjoy it. If you're looking for a nostalgic walk back to the 80s you experienced in the book you will be quick disappointed. So, if you go see this movie try not to have any preconceptions. It is a work on it's own and a minor tribute to thr text it originated from."
"692",5,"  Absolutely fantastic movie which is riddled with video game references. An instant classic and new personal favorite"
"693",4.5,"  Loved the movie. My only real complaint was a weak/wooden villain but I still immediately wanted to watch the movie again right after finishing it"
"694",5,"  This looks to be an awesome series looking forward to it."
"695",4.5,"  Great movie loved all of it! Story and characters, everything, every little detail comes back in some way!"
"696",5,"  An 80s Pop culture masterpiece.!! I loved every minute of it!!"
"697",0.5,"  If I could give 0 stars I would. Literally, horrible. Not only did it take away everything that made the book good and interesting, it turned it into the most cliche, stupid story with stereotypical villians and heroes. Wish I could get my money back, it was SO horrible."
"698",5,"  Nothing less than EPIC!"
"699",5,"  A classic Steven Spielberg masterpiece. Absolutely stellar!"
"700",5,"  Literally had me in the edge of my seat and I can guarantee you that this flick will bring back your childhood!"
"701",3.5,"  Really didn?t connect with this for the first 20 or 30 mins then classic Spielberg kicked in - nostalgia, romance, kids against authority - and I got swept up a number of times - ending very weak - and Simon Pegg - no - but go see especially if the 80s and 90s or video games are your thing."
"702",3.5,"  Entertaining, good message... a fun movie."
"703",3,"  I enjoyed elements of the movie, but it was hard to feel that the characters were at any risk because they were in a video game. Also, I'm not an advocate of anyone spending so much time playing these games."
"704",3.5,"  Pretty good. The villain was kind of predicable and childish."
"705",2.5,"  It's an OK, entertaining film. However its also instantly forgettable.The book has an intricate plot, character development and depth, go read it."
"706",5,"  Loved this movie so much <3"
"707",4.5,"  It's worth a watch, Very enjoyable"
"708",5,"  Was so awesome I saw it in 3D and this is definitely worth the watch has an amazing concept I highly recommend it"
"709",5,"  Holy Shit this was movie was Awesome!!Watching it in 3D was worth the price"
"710",5,"  Not one boring moment. Lots of action and excitement. Loved every moment of it."
"711",4.5,"  Fantastic visuals and great nostalgia. Well worth seeing on the big screen to get fully immersed in the experience."
"712",5,"  Amazing it was produced very well. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was super amazing!"
"713",0.5,"  I loved this book so much I read it 3 times. It is one of the best sci fi books to come out in years. The story is fresh, the characters are complex and 3 dimensional. This stakes are high in a life and death struggle against amazing odds with a faceless corporation bent on dominating the world. It's all set in a dystopian future with tons of 80's nostalgia. The movie has NONE OF IT!!! This is the worst adaptation I have ever seen! Until this point, M. Night Shyamalan's adaptation of ""The Last Airbender"" held that honor. Nearly every aspect of what made this book special is gone. All of the tasks to get Halliday's ""Egg"" have been completely changed. There are not even ""Gates"" to pass. Just collect the Keys. And if you loved the strong female lead of Artemis, Be prepared for a gut punch as she is put into a submissive roll where she literally says to Wade, "" you are more important than me."" Spielberg has lost his touch. If you've read the book, for God's sake do not see this movie. If you have not read the book, do so and skip this P.O.S."
"714",4,"  Behind all of the pop culture, references and flashy graphics, behind the intense action and humorous lines, this is a film about rediscovering reality. About realizing that, outside of the screen, outside of your room, there is a real world with real people. for more: https://latetothegame.blog/2018/04/01/new-movie-review-ready-player-one-2018/"
"715",4.5,"  This movie was made for nerds like me who grew up on pop culture from the 80s and 90s. It's very Spielberg, but in this case, it works!"
"716",4,"  Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Ernest Cline popular nerd-novel is a visual blast, filled with eye-candy imagery and an amazingly number of pop-culture references, not to mention the dazzling and breath taking action sequences that reminds us to the director's classic film-making style in his early days, all in favor for a perfectly harmless action flick, even though its characters lack the strength to live up to the story, but still a fine welcome to the director's classic sci-fi roots."
"717",5,"  Perfectly nostalgic. The book is still far superior but they did a good job of making the movie light and fun."
"718",5,"  It's a great and very funny movie. loved it"
"719",2.5,"  It's not without some breathtaking sequences but I think the whole thing plays it a little too safe for my taste. More impressive than the Oasis is the dystopian reality of the film where humans have essentially given up on real life and corporations buy people's debt to create a slave work force but it's just not given the focus it deserves."
"720",3,"  All action and special effects (which are very good) tied to a weak plot."
"721",5,"  This is the very first time I have ever left a review for any movie. This isnt some simple action flick that I was lead to believe. Yes there is a plethora of cultural references, but it is what isnt obvious that sets this movie apart from similar films.When i was a kid I was always told friends I make on video games arent ""real"". This movie dives right into this premise and tears it apart. Wade Watts the protagonist develops close bonds with his fellow gamers. Outside of this immersive game they band together to save the one thing that brought them all together. This film shows that no matter where in life we are or what may come true friendships can be found in even the most ridiculous of places."
"722",4.5,"  The funnest time I have had at the movies in a long time. Vintage Spielberg.Loved it!"
"723",5,"  Really fun, great portrayal of the book. Full of Easter Eggs. WIsh it would have had Leopardon, but what are you going to do."
"724",5,"  Instant classic! One of the rare ""I will go see this in theatres again"" films."
"725",3.5,"  It was good movie, very entertaining. However, beware, it doesn't really follow the book. Don't read further if you don't want some spoilers. It's in the spirit of the book, but most the references are changed. They made up different quests and they are much shorter than the book. One big change is there is no Oasis school. Lots of the chafracters in the game are made to appeal to younger kids and more from current video games than the classic 80's from the book. Music was 80s, but I was very disappointed it didn't open with Oingo Boingo and there was no Oingo Boingo in the movie at all. (Halliday's favorite band) , I was looking froward to that:( It was a good movie, but I knew they missed the mark when they missed the golden opportunity to put the Clock work Orange reference Easter egg from the book in the movie."
"726",5,"  What a great book to movie adaptation. Usually they mes these up, not this time :)"
"727",5,"  Best movie of the year. Loved it will watch it again later as so many hidden characters in it. Go watch it for sure."
"728",3,"  Decent film, better for its cg but so so on story playing on nostalgia in parts and trying to get the 'chocolate factory'. Good at matinee prices and good enough for 3D."
"729",4,"  Didn't read the book so I guess I can't do the tiresome 'the book is better than the movie' comparison... that being said... I thoroughly enjoyed this pop culture nerdy nostalgia adventure."
"730",0.5,"  Absolutely horrible. Bad acting, bad script, and a pointless plot with no stakes. It is just a constant stream of 80s references with no substance."
"731",4.5,"  A rip-roaring virtual adventure through time (forward into Virtual Reality whose entire premise relies on looking BACKWARD to pop-culture of the 80's. If you go to the movies to have a good time, see your kids smile and maybe stifle a nostalgic sniffle or two at your own distant past...then Ready Player One is for you."
"732",4,"  Obviamente muchas diferencias con el libro , retos y segmentos anulados o cambiados , el tema de licencias obvio impacta en la trama , pero aun asi la premisa y la batalla final se respetaron lo mas que se pudieron con los elementos disponibles y negociados , como siempre meter un libro en una pelicula de dos horas es un reto , y este lo fue mas por lo mencionado, Para palomear , pero si vas como purista del libro mejor ni vayas,"
"733",4.5,"  Meca Godzilla VS Gundam from Hollywood movie I never imagined."
"734",5,"  As an avid gamer I can honestly say this movie was awesome. Had a blast watching it, main character didn't seem like a fake nerd and geeked out at times like any of us would have in the same situation."
"735",1.5,"  A generic Young Adult film full of plot holes and moments that break your suspension of disbelief."
"736",3.5,"  I'm a huge fan of the book, which is part of my problem with this movie."
"737",5,"  immensely nostalgicand had a sense of adventure that90s, gamers who grew up looking for secret mario levels, zelda upgrades and meticulous cartridge saves; would surely appreciate."
"738",2.5,"  Pretty bad. Took the book and rewrote everything except like 2 things"
"739",1,"  He did a great job at taking a wonderful book and mutilating it. South Park was right, Spieldberg is an ass."
"740",5,"  This film was an excellent and ambitious viewing experience. The film was one of the most entertaining films ever put to screen. There is almost no downtime if any in the entire movie. While it does not deliver the same depth as the masterpiece that is the book, the film is thoroughly satisfying ."
"741",3,"  Aside from the many Easter eggs, overall a bit boring and uninspiring, especially the real-world parts, which are very pantomime-ish; the only excitement is provided in the VR action sequences. Def one for kids with a bit of nostalgia thrown in so the parents won't be too bored."
"742",4,"  In a way reminded me of the movie ""War Games"" and Professor Hawkins - but I really liked this movie. Great effects and a very reasonable integration between real and virtual worlds. Great character development. Good casting ... main roles were a good match and actors ... passable villain however. go an enjoy"
"743",4,"  B+, solid and fun movie with a good story. The hero development was good. The virtual falling in love was a stretch and there wasn't much there. The Villan was the usually greedy, out of touch, corporate guy and that's the only thing I didn't care for in the movie. It's a good watch, nonetheless."
"744",2,"  This is one of 2 movies I was really looking forward to seeing this year, and I'm sad to say that it was a huge letdown. The pacing was off, the story was choppy and the writing was barely decent. The plot was cringeworthy more times than not and completely forgettable. It was like Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory except without any heart or moral to the story.To say I'm disappointed is an understatement-and here I thought 'The Last Jedi' was mediocre. Go see this movie if you're dying to see just how many pop culture references you'll get. Stay away if you were hoping for a remotely engaging dystopian adventure."
"745",3,"  Best popcorn movie I've seen in a while! It was a few minor flaws. There are a couple of edits that feel like last minute cuts, and those are jarring and took me out of the story for a a beat, but it quickly pulled me back in. It's full of heart, and I enjoyed it much better that the book!"
"746",5,"  This movie is fantastic! Sure some nostalgia elements were cool, but removing the glimpse of He-Man and some others, it is just really well made. The action is great and the story pulled me in completely. The CGI is extremely good too. I have nothing but praise! I'll be a repeat viewer with some other friends too."
"747",3,"  There's a large amount of excitement to be had here, massive action scenes and gorgeous scenery to behold; it's just purely up to the viewer whether it's worth trudging through a dreadful script and climax after climax of an overstuffed runtime."
"748",5,"  Some movies are meals, some are vegetables, and some are dessert. This movie is a great dessert movie, which is exactly what is sets out to be."
"749",3.5,"  Very entertaining although it took a different path than the book does; but overall great film."
"750",4.5,"  For those that need the story to follow faithfully to the novel, move on. Visuals and storyline were fantastic and the changes make other characters a bit more full but H's story becomes weaker, which is too bad. My other beef is with the glaring omission of Rush in the soundtrack."
"751",3.5,"  Great SFX & visuals. Cheesy in parts, but I loved all the pop culture references & there are A LOT of them!Enjoyable overall. [7/10]"
"752",4.5,"  Halfway through the movie - It's a passable movie actually. It brings back the magic of those simplistic 80's Spielberg movies.. The easter eggs are alright bu - HOLY MOTHER OF POP-CULTURE IS THAT A A GUNDAM?? DID HE SAY "" I . AM. GUNDAM.""Cheers with crowd . Satisfied 100%."
"753",3.5,"  filled with easter eggs and references, ready player one is a success"
"754",3,"  overhyped, overrated.entertaining but nothing special or memorable.it throws every pop culture easter egg it can at you during its running time, however entertaining, it doesn't make for a good movie."
"755",5,"  This movie is awesome. Mind blowing in every way. Visually and narratively stunning. Not only does it show a plethora of 80s pop culture, it also sends a human message of what is going on in the todays world technology. Another Steven Spielberg classic that is relatable to every age. A movie for people who enjoy and geek out on movies and video games from the past and now. And as well for people who have not been interested, but are looking for a way to understand that world of geeksters."
"756",1,"  Movie did not have the 'wow factor'. Middle part of the movie was so boring that I took a nap during it. Watch Tomb Raider or Pacific Rim instead."
"757",2,"  Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: for all its flaws, I loved the book. I went into the movie fully prepared for major changes; 75% of the book would not translate well on to the screen. The book was for people like me. The nerds, the people who are unapologetic about their adoration for things. The movie was not for nerds.All I've seen are reviews about ""too much nostalgia,"" but honestly? There wasn't enough. The characters' obsession with all things 80s wasn't in the movie and it really wasn't integral to the plot anyway. It didn't do anything for them, except a bit in the final challenge. That nerd-normalization that felt so good in the books just wasn't there. This wasn't a movie for me and I'm okay with that. It was a big blockbuster with a lot of references to pop culture.It was a bit boring truthfully; a lot of splash with no real plot and one dimensional characters. T.J. Miller's I-R0k was a highlight, which is actually a pretty sad commentary. Ben Mendelsohn' s live action scenes clearly show he's better than his character's over-the-top villainy. And if I never have to sit through a wooden Tye Sheridan performance again I'll be very happy."
"758",1,"  Another review said ""a mile wide and a pixel deep"" which is spot on. They butchered the book's storyline (or disregarded it totally) and failed to capture any of the compelling aspects which the books storyline produced. Even if you haven't read the book, the storytelling and acting is laughable. Was real hyped to see this, and with a little imagination could have done a lot with this plot line. Spielberg took the easy path, tried to appeal to a wider audience, and fell way short. Even the CGI and action scenes were aggressively mediocre."
"759",5,"  Honestly one of my new favorite movies! (I'm a gamer and I really related to the protagonists)"
"760",0.5,"  This movie, while visually stunning.. was terrible. The book and this share one thing in common...a name, and that's it. Which they chose to not even explain."
"761",4,"  They couldn't stick to the book exactly... because that'd be boring. So, what they did was great."
"762",5,"  Steven Spielberg's best movie since Jurassic Park and the most visually dazzling movie since Avatar."
"763",5,"  Best movie for 90's kids, spree-video gaming"
"764",4.5,"  Exactly what a movie should be. I was concerned it would all be CGI stunts and over-the-top excitement. But between the nostalgic nods to the past and the gooney-like feel of comradery of the live action scenes, the VR portion of the movie fit in perfectly."
"765",1.5,"  A book that was loved by Millions destroyed by a director who is loved by Millions. Spielberg has used this move to gratify himself, it is as if Spielberg sees himself in the role of Halliday in the movie and has created a movie based on his own obsessions. Those who have never read the book may well fall in love with it but for those who have read the book it is a pale shadow of the original novel. If this movie was to be another Soielberg movie it would be as if he had rebooted Raiders of the Lost Ark by giving us Indy 4"
"766",0.5,"  This reminds me of E.T., you have a bunch of people saying it's the best movie ever, but all I see is a boring, senseless bad collection of incoherent scenes. No sense, no story, awful cast. Wasted Hannah John-Kamen horribly, when she is clearly lead role material. You have to know you're off when your lead is the star of boy scouts vs zombies. Plain garbage."
"767",5,"  It's a great movie with great plot points. If i had the budget for it I would see it again 20 times!"
"768",3.5,"  I read the book a number of years ago and I absolutely loved the book!! IT brought back so many memories of things from my childhood and brought them into the future. I was excited when I heard that they made a movie and could not wait to go see it. While the movie was good it was nothing like the book that I loved, which left me disappointed. If I had not read the book first and created images in my head of what the oasis looked like and the characters looked like it may have been better. They also did not follow the plot line very well, which I can understand as the movie was already long. However, they left out some pretty important pieces that I was waiting to see. So while good it did not live up to my expectations of what it could have been."
"769",5,"  So cool! So fresh! Finally a true Spielberg, I've been waiting for this movie since Jurassic Park."
"770",4,"  A visual spectacle filled with gamer references everywhere. Being a child of the70s and 80s that has played games all my life this movie was made for me. There are some slow parts of the movie, but overall it is fun watch and it looked incredible on the big screen. See it in the theater for full effect."
"771",4,"  With loads of easter eggs pouring out from the movie. The feeling of adventure and nostalgia is all over Ready Player One movie."
"772",4,"  Great fun. Great way to spend a rainy afternoon. I have a feeling Spielberg has been wanting to make this for a long time. Just for the fun of it. The characters are great. The avatars are fun The oasis is fun. With the look of the real world is believable and it's no wonder ever one wants to live in the oasis. I want to see it again just to catch all the eggs I missed the first time."
"773",2,"  I just didn't like it, cheesy, boring and over the top. however, the acting was great and the visual effects were amazing."
"774",4,"  As a fan of 80s pop culture, this movie give me a lot of touching. The story is just fine and many places don't make sense. But it reminds me that 80s is a awesome period. There are lots of changing compare with the novel and I think it's acceptable. It is a good pop-corn movie.PS: I laughed so hard with the shinning scene."
"775",4.5,"  Must watch!!! Awesome as bass k to the future!"
"776",5,"  I absolutely loved this movie and the book and hope to see more soon!"
"777",5,"  Great movie! I highly recommend seeing. You feel immersed in the movie the whole time and has a great plot. Saw it in 3D IMAX with my husband and we can't stop talking about it!"
"778",4.5,"  What a blast! Ready Player One is so much fun! I had a huge smile on my face the entire way through. It's not particularly deep, but who cares? This movie is classic Spielberg. Classic Spielberg has never needed to be deep to be good. Indiana Jones anyone? Ready Player One is fast, fun, exciting, visually stunning (seriously), surprisingly funny, and stock full of endearing characters. My only real complaint with the movie is that sometimes it can be a bit too cheesy, but it's Spielberg cheese, so my appetite for it kind of increases weirdly enough. From what reviews I've seen, most other people's biggest complaint is that the movie is too reliant on cultural references. I do agree that sometimes the references can be a bit overbearing, but that's kind of the point of the movie, so I give it a pass. For the most part, I think the references within the story work perfectly. In truth, Ready Player One is a completely original story filled with completely unoriginal cultural artifacts, and that makes it one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. For people who aren't fans of the cultural cramming, I would honestly say that the movie makes a big improvement over the book. In the book, the easter egg hunt is more about memorization of random pop-culture knowledge. Whereas in the book, the hunt involves pop-culture but is more about understanding the creator of the virtual world and learning a lesson about him and yourself. That's a big distinction between the two entities, and it makes the game of spot the reference in the movie more bearable and more fun. At the end of the virtual day, it seems that Ready Player One is a movie that was tailor-made for me. Maybe I'm just partial to a kicking' 80s soundtrack, but I have a sneaking suspicion Ready Player One is more than that."
"779",4.5,"  REALLY fun. Good escapist sci fy goodness. :) Was missing a few things I was looking forward to from the book; but it captured the spirit very well. It left out the bleakest part of the books; which since its PG-13 I can understand. But was an unapologetic homage to so many Speilberg references. If you were ever a bit of a nerd in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, or current; this is your bag."
"780",4.5,"  Little Andy Samberg battles for the 80's. There is so much to see. Pretty sure I saw a Battletoad.So much fun."
"781",3.5,"  This is one of those ""what you see is what you get"" kind of deals. It's marketed as this huge 80s throw back but it never feels out of place because of the world this movie exists in. It actually feels more like a World of Warcraft type of deal with this huge MMO taking up a majority of the time. But, the movie never strays too much from the safe route and even gets a little creepy with this whole Shining segment. I had fun while watching it but ultimately I left the theater with a feeling of mild satisfaction. Probably because the final showdown could have gone with the epic bass tones of Tom Sawyer but decided to go with We're Not Gonna Take it which was pretty cheesy in my oppinion. I feel like Avatar pulled off the whole balance between the Avatar world and the real world better and there are better ways of giving you that warm 80s nostalgia feeling than just ""oh hey millenium falcon, breakfast club, back to the future. Remember those things?"""
"782",3,"  Nostalgia filed Spielberg film that definitely had a lot of pop culture references from my youth that i enjoyed.. way too much to see on first viewing in face. The characters were appealing also and had an old timey movie feel to much of the interactions... with new fangled vfx thrown in.. Probably one of the more entertaining recent Spielberg films... it was a bit too long but other than that i rather enjoyed it."
"783",4.5,"  Amazing, loved all the 80s and 90s references. A must see!!!"
"784",4.5,"  I find it to be an amazing movie, I will definitely watch it again! Great characters and online personas!"
"785",1,"  If you loved the books the movie is going to suck. It felt like someone took the concept of the book and rewrote almost all the of interactions and text of the story. I was so distracted how little movie followed the book that I was constantly distracted. Two thumbs down and .5 stars."
"786",5,"  This movie throws everything I loved growing up and hits you with it in rapid fire succession for 2.5 hours and I loved every second of it! For a partially animated movie Ready Player One has surprising emotional resonnance! Run..dont walk and see this one! #ReadyPlayerOne"
"787",5,"  awsome film about memory."
"788",4,"  a fun movie with so many nostalgic references you can't NOT like this movie. Visually stunning, but i recommend you see it in IMAX 3D."
"789",5,"  (SPOILER) The only thing that I thought was a bit weird was the fact that all 5 main chars lived so close to one another"
"790",2.5,"  If you have not read the book of Ready Player One, you will not be disappointed with this movie. It's a fun, colourful and often funny adrenaline packed adventure, stuffed with nostalgia and references, sure to please movie lovers everywhere. HOWEVER, if you are like me and have the read the book and enjoyed it (the book is my all time favourite), you will be very disappointed. THIS IS YOUR OFFICIAL SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! From the first moment Wade enters the Oasis, one of the most iconic parts of the book, and the source of the book's name, is absent. By this I mean that the retro 'Ready Player One' starting screen that is described to happen before a player enters the Oasis is nowhere to be seen. But believe me when I tell you it gets worse. There is no Ludus (the school planet), the first challenge that in the book is the Tomb of Horrors and the copper key is a match of joust with the Lich King is replaced for an unexplained car race through New York that holds no reference or apparent connection to Halliday's life. And guess what. There are no gates. No gates whatsoever. Oh and I forgot to mention that Wade and Art3mis meet in real life just after the stacks are blown up, when they aren't supposed to meet until THE VERY END OF THE STORY The second challenge is substituted for a Shining challenge, which is unlikeable to say the very least. This is when we get some semblance to the book, with the final challenge being relatively accurate, apart from the fact that Daito is killed in the real world in the book, a moment that pulls on the heartstrings, is omitted from the movie. So, if you have not read Ready Player One, I recommend the movie. But if you have read the book, do not go watch the movie because you will find that the major plot points are changed almost to the point that they are unrecognisable."
"791",5,"  Ok. This movie is unique but familiar. Its a fun and exhilarating ride from start to finish. Its story has heart and has an emotional tug though not a tearjerker. A movie shown on Easter, full of easter eggs and about an easter egg. So many cameos and references that it evokes earlier memories from a screen goer like me. Well made. Watch it. 5 stars"
"792",4,"  AND WE HAVE OUR SURPRISE MOVIE OF 2018....So far and no not an April Fools joke. Based on the book, In the year 2045 people can escape reality into the virtual world into OASIS, an immersive virtual world where you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own imagination. The creator has passed away years ago and has left the ultimate prize for the player to who is able to find the mcguffins that will lead to wealth and full ownership of the game itself. But of course an evil organisation is out to get it and take control. Halo, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, The Iron Giant, Mine craft, Halo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Battle toads and a hell of a lot more appear in this so quickly that some if you blink you will miss them. The soundtrack, wow! Again got that classic 80's thing going on which is fantastic. The Cast is wow also. could go on forever about it but yeah... Need to watch this a few times but for me this was really enjoyable with Speilberg doing what he does best, Entertaining the audience. Classic Speilberg that will go down as one of his greats! Go and See it! 4 Stars."
"793",5,"  Amazing journey loved everything about it!"
"794",2,"  It was a beautifully filmed and directed... bad film"
"795",4,"  m-a tinut captivat pana la final. a avut un pacing foarte bun. scena de la inceput cu race-ul a fost foarte tare. si a vorbit de cateva teme interesante."
"796",5,"  Ready Player One proves that master director Steven Spielberg still has that same magic touch he used to enthral audiences in classics such as Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Last Ark and E.T.! The story is touching and compelling and doesn't get lost or overwhelmed in the hundreds of nostalgic cameos and seamless computer graphics. The script veers far from the novel it's based on but that's in service to the movie's momentum, which travels at a light speed breakneck pace in spite of its lengthy running time. Geeks of all ages will delight (and be a bit overwhelmed) by all the Easter Eggs (I'd love to share some of them with you but the fun is in the finding). While book purists may be disappointed that some of their favorite cameos don't make it, the ones that do (along with their replacements) will bring uncontrollable smiles to their faces.This is one roller coaster ride that you hope will never end and when it does, you'll just want to get back on to recapture the thrill over and over again. Must-See!"
"797",5,"  Amazeballs gamer life 4 ever"
"798",2,"  Paper thin characters and huge plot holes. Took an amazing book, took out everything that made it special and put as many things on the screen at the same time as they could. Spielberg what happened to you? How did you screw this up? It was already written. All you had to do was film it."
"799",5,"  A fun, thrilling ride and full of awesomeness from start to finish, that will unleash your childhood experienced. A mesmerizing film that you want to take back to the future, Jurassic park and all of the classic things happen on 80's and 90's. Easily one of the best films this year and probably will put this on your top list. Steven Spielberg and Ernest Cline manages the movie to be more related to us (Millennials) and the future generation. As terrifying and painful as reality can be, it's also the only place where you can find the happiness, but remember that real things happen in the real world and that's the thing."
"800",5,"  Very well imagines, cast, filmed and produced. 80's pop culture references are right on."
"801",5,"  Saw it three times, just an amazing and pure film with an important message."
"802",5,"  BEST MOVIE EVER!!! I LOVE THE STYLE OF THE GAMES AND ALL THE CHARATERS FROM OTHER GAMES WAS IN IT!!!!!!!"
"803",5,"  Fantastic and fun movie I'll definitely have to rewatch to catch all of the pop culture references"
"804",5,"  So much fun for the family and we all enjoyed it!"
"805",0.5,"  A full of cameos movie without any interesting history. It tries to be funny but is not. Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
"806",5,"  For some reason, the nerd community seems very divisive about this movie. Personally, I enjoyed the book. I must have plowed through it in like three days. I think the movie version of RP1 does take a lot away from the book, but it also fixes some of the parts of the book I wasn't happy with. The challenges for the keys are different, but still very enjoyable. Chalk that up to having to use what Spielberg and Warner's had license for. I really enjoyed it and I've seen it twice already opening weekend. We constantly complain that the studios are rebooting everything and that we don't get anything new and fresh. Well, this is new, fresh, different and damn fun!"
"807",5,"  omg! best movie ever!..this is far more real than Jesus!"
"808",4.5,"  It was a very entertaining movie with a lot of in depth characterisation and delevopment of platonic relationships. The forced romance is what made it lose half a star. If it wasn't so self aware, it would have been cringy, but seems like the director knows how to please his target audience."
"809",2,"  Giving this film 2 stars for making the ""Oasis"" look gorgeous. Cringy dialogue, bad characters, forced romance, and out of place references really killed this movie. Awesome as a comedy though."
"810",4,"  This movie takes the basic structure and characters from the book, and trims it down to fit the smaller narrative the movie format allows. It's a lot easier going into this movie looking at it as a separate product than the book, since the specifics of the movie are very different from the book. The book is better, but the movie is done in a respectful manner and is a good product on its own."
"811",5,"  The perfect movie for the perfect time."
"812",5,"  a really enjoyable adventure, definitely gonna watch it more than twice, so many easter eggs, so many characters i like. my favourite movie so far this year."
"813",0.5,"  Ready Player One has a bland protagonist, weak casting and terrible dialogue, but what made me stay in the cinema was seeing my favorite character being put on the big screen but references don't make a good movie, good acting, relatable charters and plot which Ready Player One has none of."
"814",3,"  I read the book and must have watched the trailer and trailer reactions on YouTube at least 20 times. I was SUPER SUPER excited to watch the movie and just left the theater a few hours ago after watching it on 3D with my friends. Wow... what a let down.It felt rushed. I was so excited by all the early reviews and how everyone keeps saying Steven Spielberg is back. I loved his early films and was super excited he would take on this project. Although his last feels have all been disappointing. I had high hopes after all the trailer reactions and early reviews. I have not been to the theater in years and was so excited to see what he could do.Again, I was let down. Not angry or anything. Just disappointed. I was hoping for something that would give me the excitement and possibilities that the trailer showed. Instead, it was just a teen movie without a lot of emotions.The love that develops between Artemis and Parzival felt really rushed. His aunt dies and he's kidnapped by Artemis' friend and he falls for her right away and the part when he parts her hair is just ridiculous. ARGH.... I mean, I enjoyed the movie. But it's nothing like what it could have been. Someone else might have made it better.I just didnt feel much emotion. Until towards the end when Gundam showed up. But even then, it was fleeting. If there's a sequel I hope someone else directs. I hope there's a remake of it by someone else in the future who can do it right."
"815",0.5,"  Extremely disappointing; does no justice to the book."
"816",4,"  The beggining felt slow but I think that was needed to set up the incredible nostalgic thrill ride that's to come. Everything past the 10m mark was just pure unfiltered fun. If you want a movie that's really deep and filled with emotional messages and plenty of character growth (like I believe many top critics did) then it's the wrong movie. But if you want some seriously intelligent fun then this is perfect. The transition between the OASIS and the real world never felt forced and the action was amazing and the apparently-now-essential 3rd act SGI explosion extravigansa was brilliantly done. Obe of my favourite final battles since the avengers."
"817",4.5,"  In short, classical Spielberg at his best with a fresh material on his hands to work with he makes another great hit. Entirely enjoyable and worth watching. It's always very difficult to restrain yourself from judging the movie when you have read the book before. I felt that this movie, while it may have not stayed entirely true to the book, was just right not just for the people who grew up in 80s and 90s but also for the kids the young audience today. And maybe it's better that it had it's own version of the story, because it leaves you plenty of room to enjoy the book after."
"818",5,"  This is probably my favourite movie of all time. The story is good, the visuals are beyond amazing, and the movie as a whole is just generally breathtaking. If you haven't watched it yet then please do."
"819",5,"  Wonderful movie and very well done Steven Spielberg..."
"820",4.5,"  While there is tons of pop culture references as window dressing, a great Spielbergian adventure film can be found underneath. I felt it was overall an improvement upon the novel and I feel like the concept was really done justice here."
"821",5,"  Spielberg make it again!!!! It's so good......not any moment was wasted!!"
"822",5,"  Just watched at Hoyts xtremescreen, highly recommended, so much good memory, so much easter eggs, so 70s, 80s, 90s good stuffs"
"823",3.5,"  As with most Spielberg movies, it is good storytelling. Decent characters and story. A good time at the movie- after one gets over the CGI world/actors. Good pace and the right length."
"824",5,"  TODOS A VERLA LCDSM!!! #bestmovie #ever #madeforme #totallygotit"
"825",5,"  This is a super fun movie!"
"826",5,"  Ready Player One is undoubtedly one of Steven Spielberg's best directed films. The pop culture references were spot on and not forced, I loved all of the characters, and the storyline felt like a masterpiece written in the 80's stowed away to be filmed today. Everyone should watch this movie in theaters because its definitely one to remember."
"827",4,"  Everything in this movie is an Easter Egg. Good choice of a release date weekend."
"828",4,"  Very different from the book, but didn't disappoint."
"829",0.5,"  This movie didn't even come close to the book. What a letdown. I was so looking forward to it. What is it with Hollywood. Do they even read the book?"
"830",4,"  I so wish I hadn't read the book first. Because I am one of those people who is gonna say the book is far superior to the film. However, in no way is the film bad. The changes made make sense, some changes are just purely alien to me and still baffle me. The characters were fairly bland, except for Art3mis and Halliday who, to me, were the most interesting and developed characters (which again upsets me as Wade, AKA the main protagonist and the character we follow in the film, is the best character in the book). Pacing in this film is also fantastic as it never felt like a 2hr20min film. However due to this breakneck speed, some of the extremely developed plot points in the book are completely glossed over, which again is a flaw that the film has. To reiterate, I think the movie is great. However, I can't say it is better than the book."
"831",4.5,"  Moviegoer goer could be on the opposite end for this one. You either love it, or you don't get it. First if you looking for great script, emotional screenplay, or deep thinking then this is not the movie for you. RPO in short is a huge fanfest for pop culture from 50/60s all the way to current day, it has almost every pop culture icon he (Steven Spielberg) can get his hands on, from music to cartoon to movie to TV show to anime and much more. Everyone should be able to find something they related to or recognized.Spoil alert: It is extremely fun watching hello kitty walking alone side beetlejuice, Gundam fighting MechaGodzilla, Ryu racing with Lara croft and much more. Isn't that all part of our childhood fantasy? It is definitely a great movie for Easter weekend especially the theme is all about easter egg hunt (both in the movie story and irl fans trying to spot all hidden message/character)."
"832",5,"  Film cho fan anime và gamer. K?ch b?n kÃ©m nh?ng ??o di?n gi?i thÃ¬ phim v?n hay :))"
"833",1,"  This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. It's as though Zak Penn and Steven Spielberg had a 5 minute conversation with Ernest Cline and forgot to take notes. The same key words can be found in both the book and the movie, however the plot has been twisted into nothing for the big screen and all of the magic lost along the way. Save your money and read the book. The nostalgia is plentiful and the story progresses at an appropriate rate to allow for exposition and to build tension. The movie? Took some ideas from the book, put them in a blender with corporate sponsors that are no better that IOI themselves and destroyed a beautiful thing."
"834",5,"  This was a really amazing movie! It's clear that they made it a tad dumbed down for the movie adaptation, but if you really enjoyed the book you will still have a fun time with this movie looking for the callbacks and easter eggs. As well as that, the visual interpretation of the story that Ernest Cline wrote was incredibly clever in it's ability to take a story that had a incredlibly large amount of time hopping, explination, and narration to create a will thought out and followable movie."
"835",3.5,"  The book is better but that's nearly always the case. Despite missing large sections of the book it always feels a litttle rushed with some elements from the book included which didn't need to be and others missing that sure have been. As a result the character development is not all it could have been. Some of the action scenes are overly fanetic. Some of the cgi is not quite up to par (even allowing for the fact they're supposed to look like computed generated avatars). Despite all that it's entertaining and worth a watch. But don't think if you've seen the film there's no point in reading the book, they both differ significantly."
"836",3.5,"  The film doesn't incorporate the elements of our main characters struggles enough for the audience to feel a true connection to him. The issue such as never leaving Lydia because he didn't have enough coin to teleport. Or the fact that he had a level 3 avatar forever prior to finding the first challenge and winning the copper key in the D&D simulation after beating the Demi Liche at Joust. I wish they would have kept the screen play closer to the original story."
"837",5,"  Amazingly fun popcorn flick. Highly recommend to anyone that grew up through the 80s, and even to a younger crowd as well."
"838",4,"  1. clever multi-level entertainment: parents will love nonstop 80s memes2. Kids might start to think of video games as worthy & meaningful.3. Only Spielberg could get away with so many copyright liberties."
"839",4,"  I listened to the audio book and thought it was entertaining, even though there were several too-convenient plot elements. The audio book is roughly 17 hours to listen to, so cramming so much into a 2 hour movie must have been difficult. They obviously had to change story elements to adapt this film, but it felt like they might have stretched the plot too thin. You really get to understand the characters in the book, but in the movie they feel very underdeveloped. Some of the scene transitions felt confusing also, where I would be asking more questions before others were answered.Now that I got the criticism out of the way... WOW! There were some amazing scenes in this movie that had me grinning and geeking out like a little kid. There are nostalgic scenes all over the place, sure, but the movie doesn't try to bombard you with nearly as many completely obscure references like the book did. The futuristic live-action set pieces were awesome to look at and I enjoyed them just as much as all of the scenes in the Oasis. It's a really fun movie. Even though the runtime was 2 hours and 20 minutes, it felt much shorter than that. I would recommend seeing it in the theater to take in all of the eye candy. It's worth it for the opening scene alone."
"840",5,"  ""Phenomenal direction, incredible casting, and amazing nostalgia, add those together and you'll get one of the best pictures of 2018! The action sequences are extremely well done and eye-popping, the story in this film is superb, and this is without a doubt the most amazing work Steven Spielberg has ever done! I'll be honest here when I say that I was watching this film as a hawk for flaws but here's the thing, I never found one! That's how amazing this filim is! With the right premise, laugh out loud humor, and using 3D the right way possible, this is the film for all nerds everywhere for what can I say? Nerds rule!"""
"841",3,"  Although a good watch, there are some lulls. Additionally, another movie by the name of Wreck-It Ralph did this already and did so much better."
"842",5,"  Ready Player One is a masterclass showing from Steven Spielberg at his full potential, combining a riveting story with compelling characters together with awesome pop culture references and spectacular action sequences to create a sweet and entertaining ride for the audience, especially those who are lovers of movies and games."
"843",5,"  OH MY GOD. THIS MOVIE WAS LIQUID HAPPINESS. SUCH AN AMAZING ADVENTURE. I CRIED."
"844",0.5,"  ???????????????? People like this shit?!!"
"845",0.5,"  Honestly one of the worst book to movie adaptations I've ever watched, it was a severely watered down version of what was a great story. Every twist is explained to you, every relationship rushed, and every character a ghost of themselves made purely to aid the main character suddenly. Artemis took the biggest hit, she reduced from intelligent to a ""hot girl"" that Wade obsesses over and who hands every clue to him because he's somehow more qualified to win the game. You couldn't pay me to waste hours of life again watching this garbage."
"846",5,"  Amazing movie!!! I want to see it again and can't wait for BluRay!! Spielberg once again has me rooting for all the characters and keeps the flow moving throughout the whole movie really well. Amazing action, stunning visuals and great story. And lets be honest here. If you take away every poor review that gripes about how they don't like it because its nothing like the book, the audience score would be over 90%. Sad that people are scoring the translation to big screen from book instead of the movie by itself."
"847",4,"  Different than the book but that just meant it couldn't ruin the great things that made the book such an enjoyable novel. Interesting take on the story and we'll worth seeing again"
"848",5,"  The movie intelligently links many ideas of the genres it expresses and highlights and for lack of a better word the movie is riddled with Easter eggs that aren't always just given to you but where you would actually have to know the subject matter of said easter egg to understand them. Spielberg sets up a beautiful world in his classic fashion of making things seem like they could really be, and then he shows us all the good the bad and the in between of that wonderful world that makes it feel even more alive. Overall a great movie and a classic I would gladly see twice in theaters !"
"849",4,"  See this one in Imax 3d if you can. worth it."
"850",2.5,"  It was entertaining but nothing revolutionary. The movie fixes a lot of the really questionable things about the book and makes Parzival a bit more of an actual person. It's nothing amazing - it relies on the nostalgia factor too much, the romance subplot had me physically cringing, and the ""philosophy"" it tries to convey is absolutely absurd too - but it's definitely fun if you want to just escape the world for a few hours."
"851",5,"  One of the best movie i have EVER seen . MUST SEE."
"852",5,"  Absolute masterpiece"
"853",5,"  The scores for this are lower than the quality of the film so I gave it 5 stars great movie that I definitely will watch again. Maybe not in the theater but I will likely buy it"
"854",1,"  Wow, shocking how bad this was! The book at least had highlights too bad all of them were left out to make room for new lows. Even the clever twists were sort of let downs. Dont watch."
"855",5,"  This movie is great and is a pretty good adaptation of the novel. Go see it"
"856",2.5,"  Ambitious start, but never delivered the feel or plot line of the book. Special effects were spectacular, but not enough to make the movie worth your time or money."
"857",5,"  Best movie with MechaGodzilla fighting Gundam and Iron Giant Scene ever!!!"
"858",1,"  Saw that with my dad and either we are too old for that kind of movie or we did not get it ...cheezy story .was not expecting a cartoon movie ...it remember the olld Tron from the 80. But did had few funny part ...not impress Thank"
"859",4,"  heck of a lot of fun"
"860",0.5,"  The changes from the book are neither an improvement on the storyline or in general. This is sadly a case of a great book poorly translated to a movie. Which sucks."
"861",4,"  Super action packed and filled with loads of pop culture/video game/music and movie culture. However, as a fan of the novel, I was disappointed at how far away from the original plot the film strayed, I understand changes had to be made, but I found it hard to let go of the Ready Player One I know and love from reading and to just enjoy the film as produced. That is really my only criticism."
"862",3.5,"  A balanced mix between action and nostalgia, set on a dystopian world from which we only got glimpses, but that seems hiding something way more elaborated. The movie itself is an adventure well set on it's time, without major plots holes but clearly some aspects that still require some answers."
"863",5,"  This movie is literally jaw dropping from start to finish. Seriously, my mouth hung open through most of it the cinematography is that good."
"864",3,"  Don't play. That's the message being presented to the audience in the film version of Ernest Cline's Ready Player One. There are other ways to prosper besides playing the game. Don't run the race. You can never hope to win it. Instead, drive your car backward and avoid the race altogether in order to cross the finish line. This is Halliday's message to the younger generation. Don't be like me. Don't play the game. The film is not a love letter to the pop culture of the 1980's. It is a rejection of them. It is a rejection of the gamer. It is a rejection of the film geek. Rather than bringing him joy, confidence and fulfillment, the amusements of Halliday's youth imprison him. Listless, lifeless and dispassionate, he is a far cry from his forbearer, the lively, expressive, emotional, and unpredictable Willy Wonka. Halliday loves video games, and television shows, and movies and music. And yet, he is the one that gets the unhappy ending. What does that say to the core audience watching this? It says, everything you geek out about is drivel. Wade doesn't dress up like Buckaroo Bonzai because he loves the character. He runs through punk, Duran Duran and the rest, because he wants to impress the girl. That's fine. But what character does he love? Who are his favorites? Surely there must be something in his time period that excites him? Without us knowing this, Wade seems hollow. He's not really a fan of the 80's. The characters that Halliday adores, Wade exploits for his personal gain. Much in the same way this movie does. Some fans of the novel are complaining that there was no Ultraman in the movie, or that Spielberg replaced Leopardon with the Iron Giant and so on. But that's where I think the problem lies with this movie. Everything is interchangeable. So much so, that it doesn't matter who appears. King Kong could easily have been Donkey Kong and it would not have changed the story in the least. Chucky could have been Pinhead from Puppet Master or even Jigsaw from Saw and the effect would have been the same. Essentially, by taking them out of their own worlds, this movie strips these iconic characters of any meaning and dignity. I don't care if the Batmobile is in the movie because it doesn't change the plot one bit. I like Batman, but I want to see him fighting the Joker in Gotham City, not being used as decoration in a movie where his appearance has no weight. In this regard Batman becomes no different that Mr. Clean or Ronald McDonald. He's a spokesperson for the movie and that's it. In this same regard, the use of The Shining is particularly depressing. In the novel, the use of War Games made sense. Wade was acting out his fantasy of being the snarky hip guy, ala Matthew Broderick. It served a purpose. It gave the reader more insight into what the 1980's felt like. It was a vehicle to get Wade into the decade he knew so much about. But here the Shining is reduced to the interchangeable villain. It could have been any classic horror movie and it would not have mattered, except The Shining is too complex to work as the next boss to be defeated. That must be why those stupid zombies were added. If you wanted zombies, there are plenty of other movies you could have picked. But in this movie, everything is cynically lumped together. C3P0, Terminator, Daleks and Marvin over there in that bin - you're all robots. Kermit could be Yoda. Who cares? The average gamer isn't represented by Wade in this movie. The gamer is represented by the IOI in this movie. Play an Atari game and try to win by its own rules and into the ice you fall. Video Games. Movies. Television Shows. Music. These are currency to Wade and his friends. No different than the coins they collect. How could a movie with Chucky, Battlestar Galactica, Freddy, and the hundreds, if not thousands, of other iconic characters on display here be so detached about the source material? Don't play. In fact, you can win before the game even starts. Go find the Easter egg in Adventure. It's there. You have to forget about the rules to find it. Except now that you've won, you must sign the lawyer's papers, even though you just said contracts didn't feel right about five minutes ago. And sign them without objection you do. Welcome to the corporation Wade. It is at the ending of the movie, ironically, with all the interchangeable characters out of the way, when we finally have a real homage to the decade. The cops come out and arrest the bad guy. They aren't future cops. They are 1980's cops and the scene is straight out of one of the buddy cop films of the day. The villain drops his gun, gets thrown in the back of the cop car, and starts arguing with the other baddie. It was funny and heartfelt. It didn't feel forced. So much else seemed like it was more about showing off whom the filmmakers got the right to use. Ready Player One. Pixels. Stranger Things. RIP the 1980s. At least for another thirty years or so."
"865",1,"  Boring souless piece of crap. Sad since I loved the book."
"866",5,"  Amazing!!! A must see on the big screen, Loved the story, the references, the characters, the visuals, Loved Everything about this movie!!!"
"867",0.5,"  Not even close to the book. Terribly written. Rushed."
"868",4.5,"  Changed A LOT from the book, more than what most adaptations change, but it what it did change it did very well. They changed the ending slightly to make it flow better and make more sense. If you go in expecting the book to be used as a script, you'll be disapointed. If you go in as a fan of the universe the book is set in, and want to see an underdog kick some ass from the seat of a Delorian, you'll love it as much as I did. 4.5/5 Stars."
"869",5,"  Fun movie. I liked the book and also enjoyed the film version."
"870",1,"  Not quite sure what this move is, but it isn't Ready Player One. I really wish JJ Abrams or Jon Favreau or any of the new directors had gotten it. I was so afraid Spielberg wasn't up to the challenge and would twist it to fit his vision rather than the other way around. I was right. This movie lost the soul of the book... such a shame but because he didn't have to change it. Ridley Scott nailed The Martian because he stayed true and made it about the great story that it was. Spielberg made it about himself."
"871",4,"  Was fun and interesting. I recommend it."
"872",3.5,"  Acceptable adaptation of the book. I personally think they made the main character too normal looking. The book was better, but I still enjoyed the movie. Has enough nostalgia for those of us who grew up in the 80/90's and modern enough for kids of today to still relate."
"873",1.5,"  The movie follows the main plot and the characters of the book but the way they find the keys shoto dying at the hands of ioi perzival infiltrating ioi to set up a robot to destroy the force field and the robots they get after finishing the second gate"
"874",0.5,"  It is very clear that Spielberg, did not even bother reading the book this movie was based on. The movie failed to show the world of the Oasis, in what it's true glory was, rather it is JUST a video game. The movie failed to even have an INKLING of the distopia world of the book. And the story, well its as close to the book as the world war Z movie stayed true to the book. I saw another reviewer say no one will remember this movie in 20 years, I disagree, I doubt anyone will remember this movie in 5 years."
"875",3,"  The way the book handled the plot line and characters was MUCH better. I understand that a lot of the plot didn't translate well to a visual film, but there were too many details I LOVED from the book that didn't make it to the film. Overall, an enjoyable movie, and if I had not read the book I may have given it 4 instead of 3."
"876",5,"  Great movie.....better message. Welcome back Mr. Spielberg."
"877",5,"  Incredible movie loved the movie and video game reference and the score was good"
"878",5,"  It's Steven Spielberg, duh."
"879",3,"  So ready player one was alright. It had some good characters but not enough development and a villain with potential cause he was played by a pretty great actor but he wasn't a very good villain even though he could've been like he was in that great movie rogue one directed by Gareth MEHdwards haha see what I did there haha. If you like movies and video games and pop culture like me then I recommend it solely because there's so many REFERENCES. There's a whole sequence that revolves around my favorite horror film the shining that I liked to a certain extent. There's also a mayor Goldie Wilson poster from back to the future among many other Easter eggs and references so if you like that kind of stuff you may enjoy it I would go more in depth but I'm too lazy"
"880",4,"  Really good movie for nerds. The nostalgia adds to the film rather than the film being purely about nostalgia."
"881",3,"  Ready Player One, directed by Steven Spielberg, is occasionally fun and diverting but also occasionally dull and unsatisfying. Tye Sheridan plays Wade who goes to the virtual world of the Oasis as an escape from the crappy real world. In the virtual world he discovers that he can change his fortune if he finds three keys and an Easter egg. Along the way he and his friends face challenges to find the keys. The first challenge, a race, is fun and fast paced and full of great action. But the next two challenges get repetitive and it soon is clear that this film lacks stakes. At no point did I feel like there was a purpose for what the characters were doing when they were doing things. And that's where the film ultimately falls flat. But the visual effects are excellent and the score is fun and it almost picks itself up in the last act but ultimately doesn't. He does have a good message, although it's hidden almost as well as the Easter egg in the film and Ready Player One tries to be fun but loses steam once reality takes center stage."
"882",4.5,"  The movie kinda rushes at the beginning; the first half of the book happens in about 15 minutes. That doesn't matter though. This movie is loaded with tons of smart raster eggs and cameos from characters from pop culture. It's really fun"
"883",3.5,"  Very entertaining movie. Paced very well and didn't seem near as long as the listed run time."
"884",5,"  I enjoyed the movie very much, you will diffidently get the best enjoyment from the movie if you have read the book, and understand the pop culture references"
"885",5,"  Best book ever, best Spielberg movie ( I love his movies) and even without the references to pop culture it would be an epic movie anyway. My wife doesn't like pop culture at all and she said it was the best movie she has seen in years because it had s real story arc snd a payoff in the end."
"886",1,"  So untrue to the book that I am uncharacteristically mad about the movie. Movie was boring in many parts, and while it may have been ok filmmaking in the 80s, sorry, we're in 2018 and expect more."
"887",5,"  Extremely fun ride of a movie, filled with nostalgia and very creative use of the dualistic world, both real and virtual. A few moments of cliche and corniness, but nothing that detracts too much. You'll leave with a smile on your face."
"888",5,"  Just left theatre OH how I loved all the things that came about in this movie. Let's just say it was pretty cool"
"889",1,"  A complete and utter disappointment from Spielberg, if I were the book's author I would sue....this is not the 80's iconic story that was told by the author and just another mediocre sci-fi love story poorly executed by a producer that should meet the same fate."
"890",2,"  Video killed the paperback star. DID Spielberg even read the book.? The movie was stripped of all references neigh adventure at the end. The keys were all wrong there were no gate challenges. Everything about the Oisis that I loved was not even there. And what's up with the whole unplug vibe? The movie was nothing like the book and I am personally sick of directors who tear apart a book and make crap movie that don't even make sense. Come on Spielberg what gives I want want my 2 hours back."
"891",4,"  Ready Player One is one hell of a ride, with tons of good old thrills, the special effects are amazing, spoting every single reference adds more to the experience, some are easy to scatch others would require to watch the movie 2 or more times to spot them, the music is great but I think they could have put more songs, but the ones that are in are really good, the essence of the book is there, and they try to respect that as much as they can but it was obvious that they would change a lot from the book in order to make the movie, don't expect to see the same. The characters are likeable but it can be the weakest point, and while the story in the book is more tragic in the movie it changes to be more ""friendly"" The 3D adds more to the experience, and you should go to watch it in the biggest screen that you could find."
"892",0.5,"  Worst movie of my life. Watching it right now and want to die."
"893",5,"  So far my favorite movie of the year."
"894",5,"  I was born in 71 - right in the sweetspot for this movie - I played Adventure, Spielberg and Lucas productions fueled my imagination, and then I learned not only that it was OK to be a geek or weird, but to celebrate it thanks to the John Hughes.I was not expecting to love this movie and it would got he way of John Carter, Valerian, Star Wars Prequels and Transformers sequels.This movie exceeded expectations on all counts. Not every movie needs a purpose beyond entertainment, Most people don't ride a roller coaster to find themselves, they just want entertainment. Go in with the expectation of being entertained - nothing more nothing less.Oh and I'l be seeing it again to go find the easter eggs I missed in the first viewing."
"895",4.5,"  The book is one of my favorites, and even though the movie is different, I really liked it, too."
"896",4.5,"  Great popcorn movie. Not the strongest plot nor unique plot twists, but it's a huge adventure film that will keep you interested throughout out. Strong laughs, fantastic easter eggs, and the acting (even though most is cgi) is not bad at all. Listen, if you want to go and just enjoy 2 hours with people, munching popcorn and sipping Coke, this is definitely a movie to see."
"897",5,"  Ready player one is one if not the best movie I have ever seen it has every thing it need to be on of the greatest movies of all time the only thing it's to short for how long the story is this is my favorite movie off all time"
"898",3,"  Its an ok film but honestly i dont feel it did the book justice"
"899",1,"  I went in knowing it wouldn't be like the book, but I didn't expect it to be entirely different. If I just judge it as a stand alone work, it was really bad. ZERO character development. We had no idea who any of these people were, what OASIS was really like, what the real world was like. Yes, there were lots of nostalgic references interspersed, but that wasn't enough to carry the film. Think of any Spielberg movie you love - there are memorable characters, a memorable soundtrack. In 20 years no one will remember this movie."
"900",5,"  YOUR NUTS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEE NIT YET!!! SOLD OUT HERE IN GEORGIA!"
"901",4,"  A very fun flick. Better than the book."
"902",2.5,"  I loved the book and have read/listened to it many, many times. Rush, Joust, Tempest, Zork-Ernest Cline had my number. LOVED IT. But I knew it was unfilmable. Everything in the trailers has been a confirmation. Have since seen it and, while it has some nice touches, I won't see it again. It's like the Atari 2600 port of your favorite video arcade game."
"903",4,"  (8.5/10)Ready Player One is very much a blast to watch. The film has mixed messages in the way it portrays pop culture fans, and it doesn't have as much character and world development as much as you want it to. However, you can't deny that Spielberg is a master of adventure thrill rides."
"904",3.5,"  This is not the story you read if you read the book...honestly, not even close. Very loosely based around the concept of the Oasis and the search for the Easter Egg and with several key concepts pulled out of the book to build the story around, but it's not the same plot, not the same riddles, not the same emphasis on pop-culture. Go in without having read the book and I think you could leave with a great experience. If you've read the book, you're going to see some of the visuals from the book reproduced on the screen, not for the story you read. Visually (I saw it on IMAX 3D) it is fantastic. Story wise, Spielberg took it in a totally different direction."
"905",5,"  Not like anybody reads anymore, but it was very true to the book. Some parts were skipped, but that is to be expected. Visually, it was stunning. Full of pop culture references and Easter eggs, but they were used meaningfully and believably (as opposed to movies that do it for the sake of ""appealing to the kiddos""). Great movie, highly reccomend!"
"906",4,"  This movie that takes you back through your childhood (if you're in your forties or fifties, that is) gets a solid 4 Icees.  When you have a movie that makes you smile throughout, you almost have to give it a great rating.Â  Such is the case with this nostalgic trip through time.So there's this nostalgic flood of references, which isn't put in to just feel good, but as an actual part of the plot.Â  Not to give out a spoiler (because I pride myself on not doing that), but the Oasis is a flood of 80's references because the designer of it wanted it to be that way.Â I found myself calling out (in my mind of course, because to do so out loud in the theater would be rude) each of the things I would see, whether it be the Delorian from Back To The Future, the maze from The Shining, the Martian from the Bugs Bunny cartoons, or any of the myriad of other 80's references.Speaking of the designer of the Oasis, Mark Rylance (Dunkirk, Bridge of Spies) does a great job of playing Halliday, portraying an odd, unique character.Â  Although he is not the ""star"" of the movie, he gave the performance that I will probably remember most.Â  As far as the primary stars of the movie, I thought that both Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke gave really good performances as Parzival and Art3mis respectively. I know that they have been in other things, but nothing that I could actually remember seeing them in, so for me this was their coming-out party... and they did it well !Although for me, the star of the movie wasn't even in it. It was Steven Spielberg, who has delivered another great story.Â  First and foremost, it is the story being told that takes the spotlight.Â  The way the movie depicts the dim state of our not-too-distant future, the way a video game could take over our lives, and the visualization of ""The Stacks"" was exquisite.Â  I understand that this movie was based on a 2011 science fiction book written by Ernest Cline (which of course I never read), but the way that it is brought to life is pure Spielbergian (is that a word?).Is it reality-based?Â  Of course not, but I could easily see that if the Oasis video game were real, it would engulf the world like no game before it, not even World of Warcraft or Pokemon Go. I could see where it would be a place of escape that most (if not all) of humanity would go to in order to get away from daily life.Â There is some mild language and a frightening scene or two, but overall it is a fun, enjoyable movie that anyone 13 and over (it is PG-13 after all) should enjoy.There is no scene before or after the credits.Enjoy..."
"907",5,"  Outstanding fun!! Saw it twice already probably going for a third time too. And that did not happen since the Matrix days that I would go see a film more than once."
"908",5,"  Great film. Spielberg did a great job and the story was great."
"909",2,"  i made the bad mistake of reading the book first before seeing the book as the hype was real. but after seeing th movie and not taking the book into account? the movie is a decent, at best, standalone from the book. it has roughly 3-4 things that were true to the book and even more so that were true to typical hollywood stereotypes. As its own movie i enjoyed it enough but what killed it for me was there were a lot of plot holes. if not for the plot holes i'd give a 3.5/5 otherwise this is getting a 2 at best from me."
"910",2,"  It was barely comprehensable from a story point and suffered from visual overload."
"911",1,"  Most likely the worst rendition of a book I've ever seen. Great book, but this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the movie..This was just a forgettable cash grab by hollywood"
"912",5,"  It wasn't nearly as good as the book, but I loved that Spielberg made it a little different for the fans of the book. Very well done!"
"913",3,"  Quite an enjoyable ride. Glad to see Spielberg back in gear with another blockbuster, and even if this one's not too deep, it still has a sliver of heart to its adventure."
"914",2,"  While the movie was good and the CGI was on point, it was nothing CLOSE to the book. VERY disappointing!"
"915",0.5,"  Ready Player One's main problem is that the story is extremely lazy and unoriginal. In all fairness, I wasn't familiar with any of the references aside from the Shining (not 80s culture, culture by the way, it was published in '77) and I would probably have been able to make more sense of the story if I had. But ultimately, there is no creative or unique story here. Just a nostalgic circle jerk for 80s nerds with an added, cliché fight against ""the big corporation."" Lazy story, lazy writing, lazy filmmaking."
"916",3.5,"  bello ma non bellissimo"
"917",5,"  I honestly loved the hell out of this movie. There's really nothing I wish I could change, just add. As again, books will always have more than the movie counterpart, but it was astonishing seeing it play on the big screen."
"918",4.5,"  In case anyone is wondering,, Definitely worth the 3D XD funds spent on the movie."
"919",1,"  What the fresh hell was that."
"920",3,"  Although it tries its best to fit all the facts and pop culture references from the book, Ready Player One just feels like a confusingly rushed film without much stake in the characters. The 80s nostalgia is nice, but feels forced and without a satisfying explanation as to why such historical references are important. One would think with the amount of source material available that this movie should have been separated into two parts, giving enough time to develop the story, include more important details, and insert as many pop culture references as the heart desires. In short, while not a bad film, Ready Player One is watchable, but leaves you wondering what could have been."
"921",5,"  This movie was awesome. It might be 10 minutes, but you can't feel them. The visuals are spectacular, the story is fun and leaves us a good message. It was great. Absolutely great. I loved it, I will watch it at least once more before it drops from cinemas."
"922",5,"  My review is not 5 stars. It's 1 star. My 1 star review wasn't published, though. We will see it's published now that it's been changed to 5 stars. I haven't read the book, but I still thought this movie was awful. The plot does not make any sense, and nothing is believable in this movie. Nothing at all. The plot is so contrived it's almost difficult to follow. A narrator voice over has to tell the audience what's going on every few seconds for the first half of the movie. It reminded me of the Goonies if the Goonies was on the set of Mad Max of Thunderdome, except it was a lot worse than the Goonies. I never figured out what exactly motivated the villians. I never figured out what the glowing Easter Egg was supposed to represent, really, or what the interactive hologram was supposed to be, even when he was directly asked the question. Some will like the 70s and 80s references and vintage video games from the late 70s and early 80s, but it's not enough to make the movie."
"923",4,"  NÃO! O Spielberg nÃ£o desaprendeu a fazer filmes aventurescos, divertidos, visualmente lindos e nostÃ¡lgicos. ParabÃ©ns ao senhor StevÃ£o que conseguiu pegar a obra do Ernest Cline e transformar em algo novo, (melhor?) e agradÃ¡vel. Seja pra um nerdÃ£o que viu o livro, atÃ© provavelmente pra alguÃ©m que nem curta tanto cultura pop e nunca leu uma palavra do texto de Cline. ."
"924",5,"  Best movie I have seen in a very long time. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I would give this way more than a 76%"
"925",4,"  Keeping this in a nutshell: Pretty standard ""orphan boy is so smart but is dumb about online dates but fixes said issues AND saves the world"" kind of thing. Supporting cast is a lot more interesting in the books, but the moments of surprise and awkward silence was cut off in favor of intense car chases and video game mass wars. 3DCG/video game visuals were top-notch and probably the reason why I'm here watching this dumb but fun flick and hoping to see my favorite characters appear in the digital world. Recommend it if you are bored and need some junk food movie fun, and if can tolerate 3D and can afford a pricey ticket: Go for it!"
"926",0.5,"  The first 15 minutes and about 30 seconds in the last big fight scene we're fairly enjoyable.... but the movie is 2 and a half ours long and felt like it could have ended 15 times, but it kept dragging on and on... Also the ""romance"" in the movie is forced and confusing..."
"927",5,"  Movie Buff, Gamer, Child Of The Eighties... This is for you!Okay so I loved the book and the movie does stray from the pages in print... But the essence, heart and nostalgia are all there! This is a great film and does the story and characters justice. It's not perfect but I will say the first thing I thought when the credits started rolling was, ""how soon can I watch it again!"" I will see it more then once in the theater."
"928",4,"  With a lot of pop culture references, most of them used in service of the plot, Ready Player One is Spielberg's love letter to pop culture and 80's references. Incredible action sequences and special effects but an overall lack of character development, RPO is a film that doesn't disappoint and doesn't get boring."
"929",4,"  I grew up in the 80's and LOVED the book. I realize some parts of a book like this won't translate well on a movie screen, or fit a in a 2hr film, but it seems Spielberg went out of his way to write a new story when the one in the book is so cleaver, creative and fun. Having said that I did enjoy the movie for what it was and give 4 stars. BTW, for anyone complaining about 'too many 80's references' those references are the whole point of the book. The author (and the creator of the OASIS) wanted younger people to learn about games, movies, shows and music from the 70's and 80's."
"930",3,"  It was okay and a passable film by all standards but the romance was way too forced, there was no exposition of who Artimis was, they made a ""resistance"". At the end I really have to say my main problem is that Artois was a Twitch streamer but not a blogger, and that she and Wade had little to no connection"
"931",4,"  Ready Player One is the quientessential of this decade"
"932",1,"  Might be better if you didn't read the book. Worst book adaptation ever. Worse than Percy Jackson."
"933",5,"  Loved it. Not just the blizzard of cameos and Easter eggs, but the way the movie captured the spirit of the novel while being so divergent. In many ways these are two different stories. Or rather, two different tellings of the same story. I was born in '63 but spent most of my life in the '80s. This obviously allows me a nostalgic indulgence as an audience member. I spent a great deal of time going: Oh look Batman! Oh look the gun from Aliens! Hey, that's the original theme to Godzilla, etc. But that was not my complete experience with the movie. I was totally captured by the characters, their struggles and loves. As in the book, I wonder why Wade doesn't morn the death of Aunt more, but that is my ONLY negative feeling about this film. I hereby declare this an unofficial prequel to the Matrix! It was engaging, exciting and entertaining. Highly recommended."
"934",4,"  its fun and knows its cheesy"
"935",5,"  Amazing special effects and engaging storyline also!"
"936",4,"  Enjoyed the film. A spectical to watch for sure. Obviously they took some creative liberties from the source material, which is understandable due to the slow nature of the book. Overall, not unhappy with the changes that were made because the general theme and feel of the plot transferred over nicely."
"937",2,"  Movie was good. Nothing at all like the book. Big disappointment over all."
"938",4.5,"  Excellent movie. Lots of fun and nostalgia for those who grew up in the 80's."
"939",3.5,"  I really enjoyed this move! Many of the bad reviews seem to be from people who had read the book and were disappointed it was changed. Let me just say that I have never read the book and don't plan to. I am basing my review off seeing it as a non-fan of the book and a non gamer. I was impressed by the story line. I thought it would be lots of explosions and over the top CGI, but the story was actually interesting, and the games the y created were very unique. There are some edge of your seat moments that I really enjoyed.However, there are some problems. This story is very male-centric. The female cast is just there as secondary support characters or love interest, and now that I think of it, so were the minority characters. This was so shameless that it actually felt WEIRD, given that most movies these days are doing a better job at not only token diversity, but actually making underrepresented people the leads rather than side supporting cast. I mean Star Trek and Star Wars are known for envisioning a future in which diversity is just commonplace, so the fact that this took place in the near future and it lacked prominent minority leads, literally felt hard-believe. I've read similar criticism from other viewers so it's not just me. Other than that. It was a fun film, The SHAMELESS emphasis on the white male gamer though is a bit hard to stomach, though, if you don't happen to be a white male gamer."
"940",5,"  Very well adapted from the one of the best geek book. It does have a bunch of changes but most (if not all) of them is done just right."
"941",3,"  VIDEO KILLED THE MOVIE STAR - My Review of READY PLAYER ONE (3 Stars)I didn't grow up on video games. An occasional round of Ms. Pac Man was about as far as I wanted to indulge. I much preferred allowing a strong director guide me through a film story rather than trusting my own instincts and limited knob control skills with a game. One of those directors I'd follow anywhere was/is Steven Spielberg. Love him or hate him, there's no denying he's a Great American Showman with a keen knack for making sure his audience is invested enough in his main characters to follow them on their sometimes epic journeys. His latest, which comes fresh off the heels of the decidedly more adult THE POST, has wonderful sweep and many pleasures, but aims squarely for the gamers and 80s nostalgia buffs out there. I loved the 80s, with its magical explosion of power pop songs, music videos, and multiplexes filled with one great teen comedy after another. Sure, we had Reagan, the onset of AIDS, and oppressive regimes committing atrocities without the internet's ability to expose them with a well-placed Tweet, but as far as pop culture was concerned, it was pretty special. READY PLAYER ONE, co-written by its novelist, Ernest Cline and Zak Penn, fills every frame with 80s references when its not emulating an immersive, virtual reality video game. While fun and light, it wore out its welcome with me due to a bloated 2 hour, 20 minute running time and a fairly confused message. It's 2045, and our hero, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan of MUD), lives in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic Columbus, Ohio. After a series of wars and shortages, most people live in squalor in RVs stacked high on top of each other (called The Stacks). With such miserable living conditions, their only escape is to strap on VR goggles and enter the ""Oasis"", where life resembles the unlimited imagination of an ever-expanding game. In addition its endless pleasures lies planets filled with war and terror, but it's all make believe. The big drawback is that a giant corporation controls the Oasis, and its players can either collect or lose coins, the latter resulting in imprisonment, enslavement, or worse. Bottom line: The world is addicted to the game and are willing to take the risks it presents. When James Halliday, one of the founders of the Oasis dies (a terrific performance by Speilberg's lucky charm, Mark Rylance), he leaves behind a video message ceding ownership of his baby and trillions of dollars if a player can locate three keys hidden somewhere in the game. Along with a slew of individuals competing for this great prize, an evil corporation forces its minions to vie for the prize. It's the 99 percenters like Wade and his Merry Band of Misfits versus the 1% as the great race begins. Unlike so many of its fantasy-driver counterparts...I see you VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS!...READY PLAYER ONE lays out its premise rather flawlessly. Despite its overstuffed imagery, it's an easy film to follow, thanks to its screenwriters and Spielberg's career-long insistence on clean storytelling. Unfortunately, we spend so much time inside the Oasis, an entirely animated world where our main characters get replaced by CGI avatars. As such, we don't get to see very much of Sheridan or his scrappy cohort/love interest played by Olivia Cooke (ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL) in the flesh. Sure, their avatars defy gravity at times and bounce deliriously through the many well-staged chase sequences, but there's a human connection missing at times. I kept wishing the avatars looked just like the actors so that we could get more of their performances. If Keanu Reeves can enter THE MATRIX intact, so could they! That's not to say that the Oasis is without its fun. This film contains so many Easter Eggs in the form of movie and music references from the 80s, including a funny but not for children sequence inside one of the most influential horror movies of all time. We also get Freddie Krueger, Beetlejuice, Aliens, and Chucky to namecheck along the way. I may want to see it again just to spot the references. Also, TJ Miller (late of SILICON VALLEY) does great voice work as does Lena Waithe (MASTER OF NONE), but, call me crazy, I would have invested more in this story had I been able to watch more human faces. Hell, Ben Mendelsohn, as an evil corporate villain, has an avatar that looks just like him, so why can't everyone else have that luxury?My biggest problem with the film, however, is that for a story with a message that we need to put down our computers and phones once in a while to enjoy the reality in front of us, it spends a disproportionate amount of time in the VR sector trying to entertain and thrill us. The marketing sucks us in with its promise of non-stop virtual action...and the film does this so, so well...but then it pulls the rug out from under us to sell us on a different, opposing message. Spielberg seems to want to have his pixelated cake and eat it too! As such, I left the film somewhat confused. With its I LOVE THE 80s soundtrack, I'm not complaining that Van Halen's ""Jump"" found its way in there, but as a non-gamer, I was exhausted. I wanted to go home afterward, curl up into a ball and watch two people talking MY DINNER WITH ANDRE-style to cleanse myself of the audio and video assault I had just witnessed."
"942",5,"  As a gamer and game designer I loved the various aspects of the movie."
"943",2.5,"  This movie was a disappointment to watch after reading the book there were more differences than similarities."
"944",0.5,"  Terrrrriiiibbbblllleeeee book adaptation... the only thing it has in common are the main characters names and the title... terrible.... ruined a perfectly good opportunity to make a classic... Spielberg literally rewrote an amazing book and twilighted it up for a few extra $... terrible... get it on redbox if you're curious about it... otherwise you'll just leave 15$ poorer with a pit of sadness where hope used to live in your soul..."
"945",5,"  A really good movie, I loved the nostalgia and got every cultural reference. It was very enjoyable!!"
"946",5,"  Excellent adaptation of an amazing novel. It's easy for critics of a certain age to try and minimize the film to an 80s nostalgia flick, but my 9 and 14 year olds loved every second - demanding to see it 2X in the opening weekend. It is a thrilling action film with great takes on classic and current memes, games, songs, movies and more. It also is a great morality tale. My only regret is that the two main characters weren't quite the antisocial nerds that I wanted, more more like the attractive person who puts on glasses (or a port wine birthmark) to be ""ugly"""
"947",3.5,"  It's a mess, but it's a good mess. What else do you really expect?"
"948",4,"  This movie was amazing in my opinion, I really liked the plot and I had a blast watching this on my birthday. the movie had a few bad things in it but you don't really pay attention to it because the movie is really interesting, if I had to grade this movie, i'd probably give it an A-."
"949",2.5,"  After reading Ernest Cline's novel, I felt ""Ready Player One"" could make a good movie. Yes, I know that there would be considerable changes from the source material as is commonplace, but I was optimistic the movie could work. My optimism was misplaced. This movie is not terrible, but I just found it dull despite all the scenes that are built on adrenaline and supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. This story seemed all too familiar. Again we get the David vs. Goliath story and David won in the end (Yawn.). The changes here from the novel don't work. One thing I will say in the movie's favor is that it tries to keep the basic theme of Ernest Cline's novel that as fun as fantasy is, reality is better mainly because it is real and that obsession is actually a bad thing that can lead to tragedy. Two of Spielberg's last three films have been duds. Let's hope he gets out of this rut soon."
"950",3,"  There is no denying Ready Player One is an entertaining movie full of Spielberg magic that reminds you of all of the Spielberg movies you loved as a kid. However, having read the book I can't help wishing Spielberg had made a closer adaptation to the book. The book for me was pure fanboy magic mixed with superb 80's nostalgia. The film glosses over a lot of the cultural references, perhaps with the intention of making it a little more relatable to a younger audience who perhaps won't get all of the obscure 80's references. The way characters meet happens somewhat differently which changes relationship dynamics plus there is a whole added rebellion subplot which never occurred in the book. Also Simon Pegg's character of Ogden Morrow has a significantly reduced role in the film compared to the book which is a shame because his character has a big influence on the finale. It was always going to be a difficult one to adapt considering the story, I reckon if anyone was going to make a decent stab at it then it would be Spielberg."
"951",2,"  Worst book adaptation ever."
"952",4,"  Sure, there are things I would have liked to see done differently (follow the book a little more closely, give it a global scale, nerdier cast)....but, what fun! Many laugh out moments, smiles, and the audience gave it a round of applause at the theater I was in. The search for the second easter egg and the performance of Mark Ryland (who played Halliday) were the bright spots for me. Also, it took awhile, but somewhere halfway through the movie, it hit me....yeah, this is Spielberg...and thats not a bad thing."
"953",4,"  Awesome movie, but it glosses over plot problems and is too simplistic at some points in a very detailed world, but it's still awesome."
"954",4,"  A fanboy knows a hater...when he sees one!"
"955",0.5,"  Worst movie I've ever seen. If you have any love for the book don't see this movie and save yourself the anger and heartache. Everything that made the book fun and interesting is not in the movie. It almost doesn't even follow the same story. Absolute garbage literally the only thing they had from the book that made it in the movie is character names and the hunt for the egg."
"956",1,"  Erased from the story for this movie was climate changed ravaged Earth, peak oil energy crisis and small Wars over the remaining resources. The movie blames Oasis addiction for the neglect of earth and its' problems."
"957",5,"  This movie was fantastic! Differently appeals to all ages, seeing the iron giant back in action was a childhood dream. Their were a few things I though they could speed up but in my opinion this movie was pretty good..."
"958",4.5,"  The movie was great. I really enjoyed the plot and acting. The cgi was pretty phenomenal. The only issue I have it the writing at times was a little cringy, but other than that it was a great move."
"959",5,"  Loved it. Its a lot different from the book, But all the elements are there, and a lot of the Books Things that are missing from the story have been put in As Easter eggs. The story works really Well on screen in Its rewritten form, and luckily Its the author of the book Ernest Clone that have works on the script. Duetter ord this movie works SO Well in 3D , As the virtuel World just seems so naturalitet experience in 3D."
"960",5,"  A must see for any pop culture fanboy! Ready Player One is packed with eye candy, endless references, and one of those movies you know you'll watch again and again and continue to find something new."
"961",5,"  Awesome any gamer would love this movie! Nostalgia galore, excitement and a sprinkle of romance."
"962",5,"  If you're a gamer if you watch anime if you are a NERD for god sake GO SEE THIS MOVIE"
"963",3,"  Despite being visually striking, Ready Player One offers little interest for those looking for a good story. Set in a distant and dark future where people are obsessed with a virtual world called OASIS, the film follows the story of a teenager called Wade who, like the rest of the players, is looking for three hidden keys in order to find an easter egg and gain control of the place. In fact, the whole movie is an easter egg on its own. On the one hand, it is really engaging to catch all the cameos and little references that are hidden across the film, thus allowing for multiple viewings. On the other hand, it may be somewhat overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with videogames, and who will miss some of the fun. The script is extremely predictable and boring, although that shouldn't be a surprise since Ernest Cline's book was poorly written as well. However, I have to recognize that some parts are simply outstanding. One of them was already shown in the trailers (the race sequence). The other is related to one of the best movies of the eighties, but i won't spoil you anything else. The actors do a fine job, but they aren't given enough time to shine, since we spend most of the time with their avatars in the Oasis. In fact, I found it very hard to connect with them. To sum up, I think RPO is Spielberg's weakest flick since The Terminal, but it's still worth watching on the big screen."
"964",1,"  So disappointing. The nostalgia from the book is barely seen in the film. And the movie is a completely different story than the book. Perhaps the movie with a different title would make this film watchable. But it's a tragedy to those whom loved the book."
"965",2,"  Good for eye candy visuals but that's about it. Relies on nostalgia and references rather than a plot that keeps you caring. Drags up emotions by showing you things you already like."
"966",1.5,"  If you are a fan of the book do not see this movie. Its like Spielberg just glanced at the Cliff notes (and not very well) and made the movie with a bunch of yes men. Hardly catches the spirit of the movie. More like the idea of the movie. If you did watch the move and thought it was good, then listen to the narrated version of the book by Will Wheaton for something great."
"967",2.5,"  I big disappointment after reading the book twice. The movie doesn't follow book's plot at all. I give 2.5 stars because animation is good."
"968",4,"  Great film. Action filled and impressive CGI. Cool story line but could've been a bit shorter. Felt like I was at the theaters for multiple days."
"969",5,"  Steven at his best. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for this generation. Fantastic."
"970",5,"  If there's one thing I've learned while watching READY PLAYER ONE, it's that even if you're having fun, you can always count on those that support you. This movie was an absolute blast. I literally enjoyed every single minute of it from beginning to end. The special effects were first rate, the story was top notch, and there were so many cool moments that will make you feel excited, happy, and emotional. With so many great moments that will take you beyond the limits, READY PLAYER ONE is a story that no one can deny, even if you want to keep playing the game and continue to have a good time."
"971",5,"  The fact this ONLY has a 76% critic rating and a 79% audience rating (at the time of writing this) is an absolute travesty. This has to be one of the GREATEST films EVER MADE - it is PURE AWESOMENESS!"
"972",3,"  Visually dazzling and well performed and directed, but it just fails to do anything remarkable to set it apart from the onslaught of superhero/scifi/action films we've been subjected to in the last 10 years. I had more fun trying to pick out the easter eggs than I did being engaged in the fates of the characters, though the sequence in the Overlook Hotel from The Shining is nothing short of brilliant."
"973",4,"  Drastically different from its source material, but still makes an interesting story for fans of the book to enjoy."
"974",0.5,"  If you LIKED the book, you may walk out of the moving within 15 minutes. Seriously. This is certainly one of the WORST book adaptation by Hollywood / Spielberg to date. There are dozens of inconsistencies with the book that materially water down the movie. The book had some very harsh realities in it, driven by a society dependent on VR to get rid of its woes. This book doesn't go anywhere near the tough topics in the book. Several story sub plot lines are not present in the book, either, which could be dealt with on with very small changes to the story. There are several topics out of order, and several major movie elements that are in contrast to the book and substantively change the plot and character dynamics. About the only thing that they got right - is Aech. That character's IRL actor was excellent."
"975",5,"  Was amazing, loved it from start to finish!!"
"976",5,"  Way different from the book, but Spielberg nailed it. Tremendous re-play potential!"
"977",4.5,"  Is a mind opening movie to new experience and we're we can be in the future."
"978",4,"  Sure, it's not very heavy on character development, and it's close to nothing like the book, but it's undeniably one of the most fun movies one can see. This is definitely a popcorn movie."
"979",5,"  Ready Player One is an absolute visual feast which maintains the cinematic experience between visual world and the real world. It's an amazing movie, I highly recommend it."
"980",1.5,"  Very disappointing that it didn't follow the book. I don't care if it takes three movies to do so... really was looking forward to see the main character go from overweight to fit - then go hack IOI - none of that happened. And the line, ""You killed my mom's sister!"" - who says that? I can't."
"981",5,"  Wow! Awesome story, awesome visual effects, and great acting. This is definitely one for your video library when it comes out. It has something for everyone- young and old, tech savvy and tech challenged."
"982",3.5,"  3.75/5 starsFirst off, they changed a bunch of the plot in pretty significant ways. So, if you read the book be prepared for that. The book is way more nuanced and deeper. Second, the movie doesn't have anything close to the 80's nostalgia as the book (which was really part of what made the book so enjoyable).But with both of those things aside, the movie was fun and the world of Oasis (which probably took up half the movie) was really done spectacularly well. It reminded me a bit of when Avatar came out and thinking about how well they created a whole new world. There are a couple of really fantastic bit characters. Both Iroc and Halliday are really well done. And most of the other characters are done pretty well.There are a few points when the movie dragged on a bit, but overall, I really enjoyed it."
"983",5,"  If you happened to read the book, this was a great adaptation to the big screen which isn't usually the case. Excellent casting and special effects. Loved every minute!"
"984",3.5,"  In another's filmmaker hands, Ready Player One could've been a masterpiece, a cunning satire about detachment and the future of virtual reality. Under Spielberg's direction, we embark in a fun, meticulously crafted, old-school love letter to pop culture and it's nostalgic power. This is to say, vintage Spielberg. In the '80s, the filmmaker sold the '40s; now, he took advantage of a seemingly unclosable cultural wormhole and delved into everything '80s, from beloved classic games and films to one too many Duran Duran references. But does it work? Every now and then. When it's firing on all cylinders, Ready Player One becomes an engaging experience, a fever dream grounded by a desire to transcend the medium. As a whole, however, the film never quite finds its center. Spielberg's visual extravaganza is held back by its own humility and the inability to make strong, unpredictable decisions. In truth, it spends too much real estate with member berries, and servicing a beat-by-beat Save the Cat narrative. Fortunately, Tye Sheridan, Lena Waithe, and Olivia Cooke make for a compelling watch, a trio of up-and-coming performers that surpass what's on the page. It's perhaps a missed opportunity that a story about finding our place in the (virtual) world doesn't translate into more than a forgettable and harmless crowd pleaser. But then again, maybe we should just lean on the film's message: enjoy the momentary escape and then focus on what really matters, the world around you."
"985",4,"  Unless you are familiar with what has been happening on the gaming and movie scene for the past 30-40 years, a lot of the stuff happening in the movie will go straight over your head and you won't get the full experience of this flick. Still, Spielberg has managed to make it interesting for those unfamiliar with the buckets and loads of pop cultural references. Most of the movie takes place inside a virtual environment called OASIS, where most people are spending their time since the real world has collapsed in more than one way and people seek to escape their miserably lives. In the OASIS, people can do and be whatever they want to be. The rich creator of OASIS, Halliday, has been dead for few years. Inside his game he has hidden an Easter egg. The one to find it gets to inherit his company, his creation OASIS and his massive fortune. To find the egg Halliday has built in a quest, where whoever wants the egg needs to find 3 keys. And to get to the keys, the ones searching for the egg must obtain vast knowledge about significant pop culture of the 80s and 90s as well as knowledge about Halliday himself.This is the premise of the movie and the fight for the egg, the OASIS and all that money stands between our protagonist, Wade Watts (who first starts out on this quest to become rich, but later finds a less selfish reason to search for the egg), and a huge corporation called IOI, who seeks to monetize the virtual world and will stop at nothing to obtain it.For those who has read the book prior to the movie, this movie will initially feel like a bit of a letdown as a lot of the references made to recent pop culture in the book as well as certain events has been left out or altered. It goes without saying that you can't cram 10 hours worth of material into a 2-hour movie. But Spielberg somehow manages to stay true to the book while creating new scenes that are still in the spirit of the book and thus creates an experience that will be fresh to the readers. Whether you then like that or not, that's for your individual mind to decide.I for one love the book and I love the movie as well, although a part of me is a bit sad that all the copyright issues stood in the way of making it possible to stay more true to the book, but hey... Spielberg, Kal Penn and Ernest still has made a kick-ass adaption with what they had to work with. It might not become a classic in this age of binge watching, where movies and shows have almost become ""disposable"" products and are not reverred the same way as those movies it so endearingly makes references to, but it is definitely a love letter to those blockbusters of yesteryears and will surely find a place in hearts of both nostalgics and movie buffs alike."
"986",5,"  One of the best movies I've seen since i was 4 years old .Really good , so many references , and thank the lord its not 18+ other wise it would have sexual references which won't fit it at all ."
"987",4.5,"  one of my new favorite movies up there with scott pilgrim"
"988",0.5,"  After telling my 15 year old son, who hate to read, that if he read the book first, we would go see Ready Player One, he cracked open that book and read every page in less than 3 days! I had already read the book so we were both EXCITED to see the movie. We took my 20 year old that did not read the book with us.This movie was so far from the book that my son and I wanted to walk out 1/2 way through the movie! My 20 year said it had nice graphics but was an ""Okay"" movie. We sat through this horrible adaptation ONLY because I paid a TON of money to see it at the theater on opening weekend. And opening weekend in Oklahoma city, as anyone who read the book knows, lead to long lines.HE MUTILATED THE BOOK! took names of characters and the basic theme of the movie to make a Hodge-Podge pile of dung. To MUCH CGI to really develop any characters, skipped over too much of the story lines and adversities that the characters faced, changed all but the final challenge. Overall, it was a mess!At the end of the movie, there were a few teens that clapped but even then the muttering and grumbling in the theater silenced the claps quickly. As we walked out alongside others who could not leave fast enough, I heard the same thing. It was AWFUL!Seriously, don't make the same mistake that we did... Wait til it comes out on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or better yet, Pirate Bay! Not worth the money or time. I wouldn't even get it from Red-box!I cannot believe that Cline would sign off on such a huge detour from the book. I have a feeling that Cline is going to feel the same way bout this book Vs. movie as Stephen King felt about ""the Shining"" book vs. movie. Shame on you Spielberg... shame on you!"
"989",0.5,"  Even if you have no idea about the book this is based on, this movie is complete garbage. It panders to lowest common denominator humor, This film suffers from the petty to pretentious and is littered with plot holes. For instance, the two main characters, Parzival and Art3mis, share a 'witty' banter early on in the film where they show off their unyeilding knowledge of James Halliday, creator of the Oasis. A few ""omg do you love my references! Let me shove five more in your face and be super obvious about it!"" scenes later they are doing research on Halliday. That is not a surprise, but Art3mis is wholly shocked to find out that Halliday had gone on a date in his life.. if these people know Halliday's favorite GoldenEye character then this really shouldn't be such an unknown.This movie is so terrible it makes me want to re-elect Trump"
"990",5,"  Very well done film. Entertaining trip down nostalgia lane."

"1",3,"  Personally, it is my favorite God's Not Dead movie. It is relevant, it deals with real flawed people, and finding our faith through it all. The characters are all relatable and I can see myself in them. Go give it a watch!"
"2",5,"  The series finally got it right. It isn't us vs them, but it is about God's forgiveness, grace and love and how we need to that light in the darkness spreading God's love."
"3",4,"  Great movie that shows our plans are not always God's plan. God didn't call his church to fight but to love, that's how nonbelievers really know that God is not dead."
"4",5,"  Had to take my children to this, Shows challenges that face Christians and how people make judgments before knowing the facts."
"5",5,"  Great movie, very emotional and reflects todays times."
"6",2.5,"  Thought this was the best of the three, with acting not as wooden as the previous two. If you are going to see this one, you know what you are basically getting."
"7",4.5,"  Very good. Highly recommend. By far best of the 3 movies in this series."
"8",4,"  I enjoyed the film. It was a good reminder that it's more important for Christians to let people know what they are for, not just what they're against."
"9",5,"  God is not dead! Despite those in Hollywood who want to poke fun at believers , or call them crazy. God is still performing miracles in peoples lives and he needs to be brought back into schools. Kids being raised without God is one of the biggest calamities of the 21 st century. And it is quite evident in some of the tragedies occurring in our schools today. There are some hurting children out there who are acting out in some horrific ways. Some schools are pushing to have the 10 commandments back in the schools. Thank God for movies like this!"
"10",5,"  I dont care what the critics say. There not directing the movies to white christians and all the other bull. Its like they all missed the moral of the story which is that belielf in god is your choice and no one should have a say in your belief. No matter your Race! The Movies point out that god (any god you belive in cause even people who aren't Christian or Catholic can relate to the hate and hurt shown in this movie) will give you a life full of challenges but u hold to strength belief and hope you can overcome anything but if its your tine to go then go in peace with whatever you hold dear. Change the word god to any other belief and these critics will have the same ideal. But if you change the word god to what you believe in and what the christian god has done for his followers to what your belief does for your followers then is the movie not sending the same message. LOVE- HOPE- BELIEF"
"11",5,"  Powerful message!!!!"
"12",1,"  Awful! Very preachy, waste of time. Do not see."
"13",5,"  It was a great movie. I personally like it better than the other 2"
"14",3,"  An interesting plot, good actors, but there were some obvious mistakes in emotional responses of characters and plot logic. However, the plot kept me interested enough to get an emotional payoff in the end. Strangely enough, I think this film could be made better just by recutting some scenes so they made more emotional sense."
"15",3.5,"  ""God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness"" (PG, 2:00), also referred to as ""God's Not Dead 3"", is the third movie in the GND franchise, but the series is... evolving. 2014's ""God's Not Dead"" was mainly about attempting to prove God's existence academically (in a series of debates between a college student and his atheist professor). 2016's ""God's Not Dead 2"" tried to prove it in a courtroom, within the context of a plot that was more involved (but ridiculously unrealistic). This third GND film goes even further into concentrating on story development and abandons any attempt to prove God's existence through facts and logic. In this one, the director and writer of the first two are replaced by writer-director Michael Mason. It's Mason's first feature in any capacity, but his efforts give us the best executed GND yet.The film picks up immediately following the post-credits scene in ""2"" in which Reverend David Hill (David A.R. White) is arrested for refusing a court order to turn over transcripts of his sermons. David's brief incarceration is fodder for news and talk shows, carrying forward the GND narrative that Christianity is under siege in modern America. David's church has become a source of political and social division in this small-town Arkansas community - and for the (fictional) college on whose land the church stands.When a female coed named Keaton (Samantha Boscarino) breaks up with her boyfriend, Adam (Mike C. Manning), over religious differences, Adam takes out his frustrations by throwing a brick through a window of David's church. That single impulsive act has unintended but serious consequences which give the college an excuse to offer David a check to buy the building - and to use an eminent domain claim to try to force him to accept. This sets up a battle royale (legal and otherwise) between the pastor and one of his best friends, Hadleigh University chancellor Thomas Ellsworth (Ted McGinley). David gets his estranged brother, Pearce (John Corbett), to take a reluctant break from his Chicago law practice and come down to Arkansas to help. But in spite of all the help David gets from his irreligious brother, and the support he gets from his new girlfriend (Jennifer Taylor), he wonders why he hasn't heard from God.""God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness"" is more enjoyable, more relatable and more relevant than the previous GND movies. This one isn't nearly as preachy as the others (not even allowing anyone a comforting ""He's with Jesus now"" when a main character dies), settling for trying to prove God's not dead by showing how alive he is in the lives of his followers. In doing so, Mason puts forth a story that is dramatic and accessible enough for a broader audience to appreciate - including well-written dialog and excellent acting. In the end, the film's point of view is very clear, along with an even more wide-ranging message about the need for listening over talking, unity over divisiveness and love over hate. ""B+"""
"16",1,"  Let me summarize this movie and save you some time:""If you're pro-choice you're a BABY KILLER! Arrest somebody!""""Gays and Lesbians are UNNATURAL ABOMINATIONS! Stop them from getting married!""""Atheists are amoral agents of Satan! Put GOD in the schools and courts! Show them we're a CHRISTIAN nation!""""Somebody BAN this Obscene 'art exhibit!'""(Us) ""If you want to believe in God and teach your kids about Christianity, that's your right. Please just let the rest of us make our own choices too.""""STOP PERSECUTING me! STOP DISRESPECTING MY BELIEFS! WHY are you WAGING A WAR AGAINST CHRISTIANITY!?"""
"17",5,"  Great movie and very entertaining!"
"18",5,"  I thought this was the best entry to the series. It shows a man of God as a human as he deals with the circumstances that tests his faith. Loved this film and will go see it again."
"19",5,"  Really good message especially for these divided times! Great Easter flick!"
"20",4,"  I was pleasantly surprised after the rather mediocre victim mentality focus of God's Not Dead 2. I think they redeemed themselves with this story and the focus on love and unity after Jesus Christ's teaching. It touched on the devisions of the world between beleivers and nonbelievers and perspectives from both that showed we as humans are deeply flawed and our understanding or ignorance comes more from the core sensibilities of our heart and soul rather that the religion we ascribe to. Overall I liked this God's Not Dead 3 movie the best, the first one was pretty good as Well and if you have interest in the speculative questions between faith in God or beleif in happenstance it broached these questions sensibly."
"21",5,"  I've not seen the other two movies in the franchise, but I loved this movie when I wasn't expecting to like it. Downside was chewing my nails down to nothing when it was stressful. The movie shows Christians living life, making mistakes and finding a way to live their faith in a very real way."
"22",5,"  This movie far exceeded my expectations!! It was more raw, more real, more exciting than I expected- As a writer myself I tend to pick apart story lines and plot twists...this movie is gripping and intense, yet with humor well paced the viewer is drawn in to the story. As a Christian I can say this movie has me rethinking some of my responses. Run-don't walk to see this one!!"
"23",5,"  This was a well done movie, with a surprise and tastefully done, needed ending. Bring friends and family to this...and stay through the credits for a bonus clip! *****"
"24",5,"  Amazing movie! A must see for anyone!"
"25",5,"  God's not dead part 3 a lightin the darkness was a great film! Don't listen to this review - go see for yourself! We"
"26",5,"  The best of the three Films in the God's Not Dead Films series. A perfect film about forgiveness and the times we currently live in. A must see film over the Easter holiday. It's not surprising that many ""critics"" don't like the film, guess there is not enough nudity, swearing or other non essential things for them. Don't listen to the professional critics, they were never going to like the film anyway!"
"27",3,"  Not surprised the liberal critics didn't like it. It's another good one for the series. It didn't go in the direction I had hoped it would and got a little PC-ish but I'm still looking forward to the next one that the critics will pan and the audience will like."
"28",4.5,"  Three is a charm! John Corbett was fantastic. I also found the movie kept me wondering how the struggle would finish to the very end."
"29",4,"  Good solid movie about difficult themes. This is an interesting treatment Christian movie, in that everything doesn't end in a perfect little bow, just because we pray. Real problems, portrayed well, with good acting, by good actors. Less crusade than the first two GND movies, more story. Good choice!"
"30",3.5,"  Good message about forgiveness but I liked ""I can only Imagine"" better. John Corbett was superb as Pearce."
"31",5,"  Great movie, very much touches how people react to religion but does not go as far as it could. There is a lot of hate targeted at Christians, as can be seen and witnessed by some of the reviews posted here that are purely in the interest of hurting this film because it is Christian . Thank you"
"32",3.5,"  The film focuses alittle too much on comedy but still is focused on major issues that gotta be dug into to prove God."
"33",1.5,"  ""Jesus was the ultimate social justice warrior""lol get outta here with that garbage."
"34",4,"  It was a good movie."
"35",4,"  Definitely worth seeing. It shows the importance and power of God's love and grace. Does a good job illustrating the struggles that Christians are going up against in today's world and how God is able to guide us and bring us together through it all."
"36",1,"  Once again more shameless, aggressive pro-Christian agenda, Not Dead 3 treats movie theaters like churches and attempts to brainwash some more non-believers or milk more dollars out of devout Evangelicals."
"37",5,"  I always laugh at the critics. They so predictably hate Christian movies.We LOVED this movie. It's well written, well acted, and it's challenging as a Christian. If you're not a believer I still really recohmmend it because it shows our himan side and how just because were Christian's doesn't mean we don't have questions or that we don't struggle to act like Jesus when things get hard.It's a great movie."
"38",1,"  It's just a feel-good Christian film, but I'll admit that it's better than the previous two."
"39",0.5,"  Embarrassed of Christians who will like this. Pastors shouldn't make movies. Do yourself a favor and pretend it doesn't exist"
"40",2.5,"  Not near as good as original. Original was debate between prof & student over existence of God. This one gets into geo-political conflict over a church on college campus & whether it can be removed legally or strong-armed."
"41",5,"  Excellent, in a time of regressive left wing agendas and immorality its good to see a movie with truths."
"42",4.5,"  Finally a well told story that makes you laugh and entices you into a engaging story. For the first time in a long time I was surprised I couldn't guess what would happen next. Its 100% different than the previous 2 versions and well worth it."
"43",0.5,"  god might as well be dead after seeing this loser flick."
"44",0.5,"  Once more the morons need to attack higher learning, just like the first one. Stupid question: what do they hope to accomplish with yet another unnecessary sequel?"
"45",1,"  Another pure Christian propaganda film.I can't wait to the Bible Reloaded and atheist community on youtube rip a new asshole in Pure Flix. #God is not real"

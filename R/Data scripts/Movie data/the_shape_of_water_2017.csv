"1",4,"  Wonderfully crafted romantic fairytale from the hands of Guillermo del Toro."
"2",1.5,"  Weirdest movie I have ever seen. Reminded me of beauty and the beast but def didn't capture my emotions."
"3",1,"  A major disappointment."
"4",0.5,"  Sickos that enjoy BESTIALITY and a FUGLY woman masturbating in her bathtub will enjoy this movie. Nasty arse sickos....and abominable."
"5",1,"  This absolutely has to be the worst movie ever to win the best picture award. Many of the characters were more like cartoon characters than real people and the theme is nothing new kind of like King Kong. How could such an awful movie win the best picture award, must be the studio paying Russian trolls to pump this up."
"6",5,"  Loved it. Weird romance story. But it was touching. Brought some current social topics up. Nice touch."
"7",2.5,"  Definitely didn't deserve the level of acclaim it received."
"8",4,"  Well done movie with a twist at the end"
"9",5,"  The Shape of Water is the only movie that can be compared to Paddington 2 in terms of completeness. That makes it easy to detect flaws in the completeness, and Sally Hawkins ' performance in Paddington 2 is very irritating to talk about more. Doug Jones's waterlogged acting was good, and Richard Jenkins's portrayal of the character and Zelda : Octavia Spencer. Personally, I think you should never miss this movie."
"10",4,"  New age beauty and the beast fairytale. The beauty is mute and beast is a subject of experiment for scientists and Soviet spy."
"11",0.5,"  How in gods green earth did this get an Oscar. This movie is total garbage, horrible script and a storyline that is not possible to follow. I think it's some kind of porn. I feel so sorry for the actors as this will be on there resume permanently."
"12",2.5,"  One copy to splash movie ....really for the Oscar??mmm well for my not..."
"13",4,"  I wasn't even sure I liked the movie after I saw it, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I think it's worth a second watch for me. Guillermo del Toro does not dispoint in his visual-centric story telling. While there is a scene with a cat I dont think I can ever unsee, the twist on fairytales and monster stories where (spoiler) man is the biggest monster of all is refreshing. For those who were upset by the ending of Pans Labyrinth, they may find this ambiguous ending to be more likely happy, while up for interpretation. Come for the beautiful visuals, stay for the representations of minorities (including black, gay, mute and female characters) in their fight against the machine."
"14",2,"  original story - but can never get the 2 hours back i sat and watched it"
"15",4,"  Great, but Oscar-winning great? Not really."
"16",4,"  It's basically E.T. but with lots of sex."
"17",3.5,"  A fish out of water story (for shore) with a fishy love affair leading to an escape in order to avoid becoming fish filet."
"18",4,"  Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water is a beautifully crafted film about friendship, love, sacrifice and acceptance. Unfortunately, it constantly reminded me of a specific Simpsons episode that dealt with Troy McClure and his ""romantic abnormality"". Don't get me wrong, this is a terrific movie filled with great performances, gorgeous production values, and a wonderfully dark sense of humour...I just kept hearing Phil Hartman's voice in my head the entire time. Not everything in the movie works, but I don't think any of it would've worked unless Guillermo Del Toro was in complete creative control. It's essentially his twisted take on Beauty and the Beast, just replace the beast with the creature from the black lagoon. The budding romance between Sally Hawkins' mute Eliza and the God-like amphibian man may be at the forefront, but it was the friendship between Eliza and her neighbour, played by Richard Jenkins, that was the highlight of the film for me. Then there's poor Michael Shannon, relegated to playing the same one-dimensional bad guy over and over again...although Del Toro does give his character a hilariously morbid gag about his fingers slowly rotting off. It's this kind of dark humour sprinkled throughout the movie that made me enjoy it that much more. The Shape of Water is well acted, emotionally engaging, surprising, funny, and very, very weird. It still makes me laugh that a movie about fish sex won best picture."
"19",2,"  Dull as dishwater. Pretty to watch at the start but ends up as a ball of nothing, with authenticity issues galore. You won't care about any of them by the end."
"20",2,"  Visuals was only good thing about this movie"
"21",4,"  ""When he looks at me - the way he looks at me. He does not know what I lack or how I am incomplete. He sees me for what I am, as I am.""This film was strange, yet haunting. Disturbing, yet poetic. I loved the cinematography, the music, and the moral behind this film. Love is not judgemental, and this film leaves you with an ache in your chest."
"22",3,"  This is a weird movie, a sort of cross between Splash and Beauty and the Beast. The American paranoia of the 1950s and 1960s is clearly demonstrated. Some of the characters are a rather disturbing reflection of what appears to be resident in the Trump White House. The violence was disturbing, but the passion of the actors was very emotional."
"23",2,"  Boring, poorly paced, and wholly unremarkable."
"24",3.5,"  A unique love story / sci-fi monster flick. Amazing filming and effects with a tender story under it all."
"25",1.5,"  Terrible movie. There were way too many parts that made no sense whatsoever. Poor pacing, generic love story, too long by about an hour for the story told, didn't evoke any real emotions. Literally every white man is evil except the communist? Can you shove the political agenda any further into my face? How the heck did this even get nominated????"
"26",4,"  Really enjoyed this movie, the dark tones and characters were great. I still don't buy that Del Toro did not have Abe Sapien in mind, but that is a conversation for another time."
"27",0.5,"  This movie was an assault on the senses. Totally gross from any aspect."
"28",3.5,"  Mm loved its vintage styling and music but really?? Sex with an alien amphibian????"
"29",2,"  About the only thing surprising in this film was the amount of overt sexual content was used to try and make it interesting. Even that was less than entertaining."
"30",4,"  Weird as Hell and Strangely Fascinating!Great Performances!"
"31",5,"  Gorgeous to look at, a modern twist on a fantasy tale and supported by the talented Hawkins and Shannon. Shape of Water is a masterpiece of film and a top mark for Del Toro to date."
"32",1.5,"  This movie had a way of over-extending many scenes. Could have been cut to about an hour."
"33",5,"  Del Toro is back on form with this film. Is it a monster film, a cold war film, a prisoner breakout film? It's all this and more due to del Toro ability to make his films transcend genres. Everything just fits together so well, including the added social commentary about the treatment of blacks and homosexuals."
"34",0.5,"  Such a bad and weird movie, I can't believe that this won best picture over actual good movies like Logan, or get out."
"35",5,"  A 100% deserved Oscar as the best movie of 2017!!!"
"36",2,"  Best picture?!! HOLLYWOOD CHEESE."
"37",0.5,"  I haven't seen a movie this bad since La La Land. Sure the set design, costumes, and most of the acting was good. I'll never get those two hours back."
"38",5,"  I absolutely loved this movie. The soundtrack as well as the visuals were, as expected from Del Toro, beautiful. I went into the movie not knowing it was one of his movies, but later I was not suprised in the least. Stylistically it was very similar to Pan's Labyrinth. Those two movies, even if very different story wise, conveyed a similar kind of feeling. If you liked one of them, I'm certain you'll like the other as well. I can understand that some might found it a tad too long but I didn't feel that a single scene wasn't necessary for the story as a whole. Which is why for me it's one of the best movies that came out in 2017."
"39",2,"  It was beautiful - and incredibly boring. I just assumed a film about a woman falling in love with the Creature from the Black Lagoon would be more exciting."
"40",3.5,"  A little slow in parts"
"41",1.5,"  This film made interesting choices, and was unique in itself, but it was very uncomfortable to watch, especially because one of the first things we see our main character do in their morning routine, it masturbate in the bathtub. The film was very different, but the plot was very predictable, and it was pretty obvious the entire time nothing bad was going to happen and she was going to end up with the creature from the Black Lagoon in the end, but it what didn't make since to me, is that the scratches on her neck turned into gills and she ended up being able to breah under water. I'd honestly like to see a weird love story like this not have the most strange but predictable ending ever and not end up with a ""happily ever after"". I'd say, if you're thinking about buying/renting this if you missed it in theatres, just pass on it. It's basically soft-core Creature of the Black Lagoon porn (it's almost like a fanfiction more than a movie)."
"42",3.5,"  The visual stylist spins an adult fairy tale that takes elements from ""Beauty and the Beast"" and recasts them in an alternative universe"
"43",3,"  A girl learns how to get it on with a fish while an evil government officials fingers rot off...ehhh 3 stars"
"44",3.5,"  Not at all what I was expecting. Alot of throw backs to old Hollywood. All the performance's were great. The creature design was beautiful and the story was surprisingly sweet. I don't think it is for everyone but I think film fans have alot to appreciate in this one"
"45",0.5,"  Terrible. Unintentionally hilarious in parts. Boring in most others."
"46",2.5,"  no tan buena como dicen los ""criticos"""
"47",1,"  visually A beautiful movie but very disappointing. The dialog, story, and characters left me wanting more. It was like an episode of the twilight Zone or outer limits that I see on the scifi channel. An interesting concept but not executed well. definitely not 'best Picture of the Year'."
"48",5,"  I enjoyed too much this movie. I loved Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon interpretations. Sadly they didn't won an Academy Award. I liked the Plot Twist at the end. I loved the soundtracks of the movie, it's fits perfectly in the movie. And the labs based on the year."
"49",2,"  Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins were the only redeeming factor to this film. Not a fan of Sci-fi, big hollywood special effects. There should be a category for this, because the Big Sick, was the best film, imho."
"50",5,"  Loved the soundtrack and Sally Hawkins was fantastic in this movie."
"51",2.5,"  FLAW: The creature was scooped from the Amazon, right? But the woman adds salt to the water in the tub to keep the creature alive, right? Why? The Amazon is freshwter."
"52",0.5,"  This movie was only duller the second time around. I personally find the characters completely 2 dimensional good/bad.The lack of grey makes this movie dull and uninteresting. The only person who seems real is the best friend's husband that calls the police. To be fair that's the only normal response in the entire film."
"53",4,"  In the era of the paranoid 1960's, Elisia (Sally Hawkins), a mute cleaner working at a government laboratory, befriends a strange fish-monster (Doug Jones) held captive there. When the monster's life is threatened by a hostile agent (Michael Shannon), Elisia, along with her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and a sympathetic Russian scientist (Michael Stuhlbarg) bring the creature to her home, where she starts to develop stronger feelings for the lonely beast....Taking inspiration from Universal's Creature from the Black Lagoon along with themes from some of his other films such as Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, Guillermo Del Toro's latest film is a haunting, yet visually stunning Beauty and the Beast tale that brings the career of one of the best fantasy directors out there back to his roots in the dark fantasy genre in the vein of Cronos and The Devil's Backbone.Much like how Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth used the setting of the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain as a way integrating fantasy with reality, The Shape of Water uses the Cold War setting to it's full advantage in it's themes within the main narrative of Elisia and the Monster facing antagonists who are motivated by fear of anything that isn't the perfect image of a ""proper"" American with the characters of Giles and an African-American cleaner named Zelda (Octavia Spencer) having to undergo their own subplots of being rejected by society with the former being homosexual and the latter not being white.Although some people may find the fact that Del Toro regular, Doug Jones is playing another intelligent fish-monster after previously playing a similar creature Abe Sapain in the Hellboy films slightly amusing, both he and Sally Hawkins have a heartwarming romantic arc as shown in several sequences where they bond over sign language, even if it's a bit less interesting than the ones featured in those films.Overall, The Shape of Water is another great fantasy epic from Guillermo Del Toro that should satisfy both his fans and for anyone looking for a late Valentine's Day film that offers something that better, down where it's wetter, under the sea."
"54",4,"  Hook, Line and SinkerDel Toro's unique Oscar winning tour de force confirms the Mexican as the greatest fantasy film maker alive. Visually sumptuous, the film boasts great performances throughout. The story is compelling and involving and deserves close attention.On the surface, it is an unlikely love story between a deaf mute cleaning woman and a captured creature that lived in the Amazon - so much, so Creature of the Black Lagoon. What drives this film is hatred of men - misandry - and a rejection of the 'patriarchy' in no uncertain terms. Hence, it won Best Picture in the year of MeToo.While this is involving it is also undermining. No heterosexual male character is remotely admirable - the Frankenstein lookalike Michael Shannon, who plays the creature's persecutor, the General, even the black cleaning woman's husband - all come in for narrative vitriol. The only male characters to be portrayed as humans are the gay artist neighbour (Jenkins) and the communist spy (Stuhlbarg). It is the women who are virtuous and triumphant - the mute cleaning woman (Hawkins), her buddy (Spencer), who conspire to save the creature from being murdered and cut up by setting him free to return to the sea.So the fantasy is really similar to Pan's Labyrinth - a tale of misandry, in which the patriarchy surpasses women, gays and nature to control, dominate and even, kill it. It plays to the current feminist narrative with relish, the story turning ghoulish and bloody to make the points unmistakable. It is stil a great film - original, brilliantly written, directed and performed. But what underlines the story cannot be glossed over or excused. It is a hate letter to the imagined patriarchy and to heterosexual men. Period."
"55",4,"  Screwing with amphibians for dummiesTHE SHAPE OF WATERTruly original movies, or at least the utter feeling of novelty when watching a film is very hard to come by. Guillermo del Toro's proves himself again as one of this generation's most visionary filmmakers constructing a film that feels as refreshing as a swim in the lake*. This movie is one of the most fascinatingly intelligent of this year, it's a daring and historic endeavour in the movie industry. And look, it isn't by chance that this movie has flushed away* the competition when it comes to Oscar noms, the film is the most lavishing technical masterpiece of this year: the resplendent production design is pushed to perfection, building not only a space that is so removed from us both chronologically and visually, that it's exaggerated to create a distinct world where such a creature is justifiable; the French-inspired score by Desplat who compliments the story making them indissociable; the murky and unwonted cinematography with bold stylistic/ colour choices which makes every shot a underwater dream; and the impeccable sound design. However, I don't agree with the editing nom as I find that it's the movie's biggest blemish because it's moderately overcut, there are many tone shifts across scenes where there should be none and the way that conflict is carried out throughout the runtime is not at all balanced. It's also lacking way more care when to spend time with our characters to develop their relationship to the longest extent (instead of jumping over some days at a time). Conversely, the Academy failed to nominate one of the best visual effects of the year, striking a dashing balance between practical and digital effects. When they're on full display, you don't doubt the creature's credibility and when they're not so flashy, you can't even notice their presence and that's what that craft is all about. It also features immensely successful actor-character pairings as Michael Shannon taps again into his ability to play a sociopath creating a menacing antagonist and Richard Jenkins serving as the protagonist's partner in crime alongside Octavia Spencer who doubles as a comic relief. Of course, Sally Hawkins is mouth-watering* in her portrayal of a mute woman who is not tamed by her disability but rather strength by it. She complements the quiet nature of the monster who, like her, can't talk, reinforcing that communication can be dissociable from speech and does not imply it, which in turn allows the director to adhere to one of cinema's biggest lessons: show, not tell. By giving the mute woman the spotlight and by placing the black woman and gay man as the voices of conscience that can actually talk, del Toro gives expression to the voiceless, those fish out of water* who are pushed away by society and are thought to be inferior. That contributes and is interleaved with the movie's theme of unconditional love, a love that disregards the societal anger towards a different skin tone or species, that fear of the other, of what we don't understand which continues to contaminate the world today. The creature is the only one who sees Elisa despite of her disability. Also, Elisa is treated as an independent and highly intelligent woman who is unapologetically shown masturbating (which is rare) and shifts the role of damsel, being the one who saves her lover. All that makes the movie unimpeachable from an ideological point of view but it's so much more than that. Del Toro wears its references crystal clear and his love for misunderstood monsters from his childhood is evident (he wants to rewrite the faith of the creature of the Black Lagoon). It's a love letter to Classic Hollywood films combining the ideas of B horror movies with the grace of Golden Age musicals. It's the most musical-like film of the year without even being a musical as it borrows the essence of Astaire and Kelly's movements to imprint the film with a dream-like fluidity. At the end of the day, this adult fairly tale is one of the most captivating films of the year, it's an all-inclusive, female-empowering musical feature that isn't shy on showing sexuality or violence. A fascinating film to watch and a kiss on a monster's slimy cheek. *Warning: FrameReel apologizes for the overuse of bad water-related puns"
"56",3,"  Pic's initial set-up discloses mediocre treatment given to a unique premise - a regulation-issue U.S military lab receives a unique wild creature captured from the depths of South America's jungles. Unlike many amphibians, it is humanoid, with a bipedal upright posture and a face with eyes and lips, with the crucial factor being its breathing organs that respire both in air and water. With the scientists unable to fully analyze its unique physiology, the military hits upon the brilliant idea of killing the creature by vivisection so that its secrets will be finally laid bare. In this barbaric equation, where's the relief ? It comes in the form of Elisa Esposito - the facility's petite cleaning woman, who is mute. She is not a physical beauty but there is a gentleness in her demeanour that is like a calming surf. This quietly angelic and elegant essence is exquisitely conveyed by Sally Hawkins. Early on, we see her naked body descending into the bath-tub and I later wondered what was the purpose of this element of nudity apart from its elemental appeal. Presumably, Del Toro's idea is to show her as she is, with no secrets at all , an uncorrupted transparent presence. She takes a liking to the aquatic humanoid and the feeling turns reciprocal. They are both outsiders , and yes this is a movie that also bows its gills to the plight of the gay, and the African-American. That admirable sentiment should be handled delicately of course, with artful amplification without shouting it from the rooftops, but Del Toro is unable to develop that poignant dynamic to its acme. There are some exquiste whispers to this effect though, as the aged Giles (an excellent Richard Jenkins looking, sounding and emoting very much like an aged Walter White) sits beside a bath-tub and spills his heart out to his partially comprehending one-off counterpart.The picture is a success on many fronts till the half-way point, and after that while its retains its narrative sensibility, the imagination mucks around on the ocean bed, not finding much to vary the palette. Elisa takes a very bold decision ( cf. the govt.-alleged activity of Wikus van de Merwe of 'District 9' ) and her decision one fine evening to 'run the tap' flows into a gloriously wreckless beauty of a scene. The movie is not coy about what our unshackled Amphibian Man can be, and his encounter with a cat fully justifies a scream. Yes, there are some fantasy touches of what he can do , but it pales in comparison to what Spielberg achieved when he sets Agatha and John loose in a mall in ""Minority Report"". The biggest weak link is the villain - Colonel Strickland competently enacted by William Shannon. For me it is impossible to see him without remembering ""Jaws"" - the giant-like man of craggy-boulder, scary face played by Richard Kiel as the ultimate villain in some Bond movies. Del Toro might very well have been looking to channel this scary-giant effect when he used Shannon for the role. It is worth noting how both the monsters, the one inside the water and the one outside, take a liking toward the simple and docile lady in their perimeter. Shannon though has a very limited brief - to act like an alpha prick with everyone, to bloodily beat up the Ambhibian Man, and to have brutally mechanistic sex with this wife. The role becomes straight-jacketingly two-dimensional and if Shannon tried to improvise some much needed dual shades, it either doesn't come through at all or Del Toro quashes it. More @ Upnworld"
"57",5,"  Everything fans of inter-species romance have always wanted but never thought they would get."
"58",4,"  Great Writing: 2 StarsA peculiar fantasy period piece!. Some of the motives of the characters waiver a bit at times, But nothing TOO distracting.Great Production: 2 StarsSet design, special effects and lighting were all memorable! While i enjoyed the blue green scheme i felt it kept it from being truly beautiful!"
"59",3.5,"  Beautiful visually. Wish I'd seen it on the big screen. Think my expectations were too high given it won the Oscar, but still pretty darn good."
"60",3,"  Slow start picks up a bit later, but quite average in the end"
"61",4,"  Colorful period piece."
"62",1,"  Fuck no! The entire movie was a obnoxious, poorly plastered sequence of weird ass shit. Would not recommend. The main character thats mute turns out to be a alien and goes off to live happily ever fucking after underwater with some Loch Ness looking thing that escaped the high security military base the main character worked at; only escaping with the help of the main character. WARNING she fucks the creature from the black lagoon looking alien thing."
"63",3.5,"  Of all the Best Picture nominees of 2017, I was the most excited to see this movie, and was thus the most disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It's good, yes, but not nearly up to the caliber of Del Toro's incredible ""Pan's Labyrinth"". It's a lovely little fable about two outsiders who find each other and fall in love against all odds, and it's all very sweet. But honestly, this story could just as easily been told as a Disney animated film. The story is unoriginal and the characterizations are one dimensional. Everyone in the movie is either a really good and moral person or a raving sociopath (I'm looking at you, Michael Shannon! But oh, doesn't he always play that raving sociopath role to perfection?). It's all very basic and predictable. I did love the imagery - it's a romance that looks like a horror movie, and it really worked for the story (all the direct references to ""green"" were a little much though... yes, we get it, the movie is green). But at its core, it's a parable about ""otherness"" in a world in which you do not belong, and the loneliness that this breeds. It's sad, but sweet at the same time. But there are too many eye-rolling moments for me to call this one of the best films of the year."
"64",3.5,"  MILD SPOILERS This is a tough one. A genuinely twisted love affair (as you would expect from Del Toro) that is beautifully shot. However I had two problems with it, and the first one is that the music that is chosen seems to be at odds with the setting. I'ts 1950's America and a lot of the backing is French style mournful/playful accordion that is better suited to Amelie (or if you're English then it would be 'Allo 'Allo). It just really jarred with what I saw onscreen and actually detracted from the tension/romance etc.The second problem that I had was the fact that all mean (except the gay character) are portrayed as total psychos/idiots. Except for a gay character and a communist spy. The culture of the USA in the 50s is shown as being brutal and uncaring. And of course, the women are the only ones with any sense whatsoever. Normally I don't care about this stuff but it seemed exceptionally heavy handed in this case and didn't really serve the plot in any way. Anyway, that is more of an indepth cultural analysis. It's a good film but don't expect it to reach the heights of Pan's Labyrinth. I suspect the Oscars that it received may well be because of the more in depth analysis that I have mentioned here, rather than the strength of the film itself!"
"65",4,"  While the premise of bringing back a classic movie monster for an interesting new story is a brilliant idea, it did not translate as well onto the screen. It's story is underwhelming, riddled with plot holes and at times is preachy with its overplayed themes of the struggles of America's disenfranchised in the 60's. Nonetheless it is a technical masterpiece from its gorgeously detailed costumes and sets to its unique soundtrack and ingenious cinematography. Despite its style over substance problem it still retains a sort of weird charm that makes it absolutely worth it to see."
"66",1.5,"  I'm not going to lie, I skimmed through it. I didn't even stay for the ending. The plot, the characters, and the romance were so badly constructed, it was torture. Only the cinematography (though the coloring could have looked less sickly with a little bit more orange or coral) and the premise were interesting and for those, I am going to give it 1 star. The acting was ok, so here is another 1/2 star. I recommend you to do something better with your free time (e.g. watch Pan's Labyrinth)."
"67",4.5,"  Very well done. Deserved the Oscar."
"68",4.5,"  Guillermo takes a fairly generic forbidden love plot and masterfully crafts it into something you've never experienced before. Everything about this movie was well polished. It felt like he was given complete artistic freedom to realize his vision."
"69",1,"  Too violent and predictable"
"70",2,"  A mute fell in love with a ""fish"", take it away fr the research facility f#%k with the fish, got killed but the fish bring her back to life by turning her to a fish~ call me narrow minded but i cant understand how is this a good story telling.. this is the reason im not interestted with Oscar anymore.."
"71",5,"  Del Toro knocks it out of the park with this movie. Well deserving of the best picture."
"72",3.5,"  It was OK. Visuals were amazing - as usual - and I really liked Michael Shannon but an extremely predictable main story pulled it back into mediocrity."
"73",5,"  The best picture, acting and directing I have seen so far. Immersive and so believable. You live through the script with characters."
"74",2,"  An interesting concept squandered by shallow storytelling and forced conflict. Painfully predictable and hollow."
"75",0.5,"  This movie was terrible. Very boring, slow moving, predictable, and hokey."
"76",5,"  An artistic masterpiece. It was like watching a painting that moved."
"77",3.5,"  Good not great movie with del Toro's usual great visuals but best movie of the year?????I think not."
"78",4.5,"  Really like this movie from the way it shot and the characters in the story. The story is unique enough to keep me engaging for the whole time."
"79",3,"  While being masterfully crafted and visually flawless, The Shape Of Water lacks a compelling narrative and dynamic characters. The crude sex scenes served as a cheap and easy way to portray emotions and attributes which could have been depicted much more artistically and tastefully. At times, I was drawn in by the outstanding performances and visual effects. At other times, I was dismayed by the silliness of it all. In addition, I thought the final scenes too closely resembled Del Toro's previous work Pan's Labyrinth. If you're interested in seeing what all the hype is about, give it a watch. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
"80",4,"  The movie ""Shape of Water"" is about a mute and awkward woman, Elisa, who works at a high-security government laboratory where she meets a strange sea creature. The creature was captured from a South American river and is human and fish like. Those at the government are studying and experimenting on it.The Creature is treated poorly by most of the people at the lab, but especially by the lead villain, a guy named Richard. Elisa, on the other hand, treats the creature as a friend, feeding him, trying to do things to make him happy, and this leads to her eventually falling in love with him. The creature is very special as you will notice in the last scene of the movie. Elisa is also very special so the ending was very appropriate.Even though Elisa does not speak a word in the movie the actress who played the part, Sally Hawkins, did a wonderful job of giving us so much emotion and feeling that it didn't matter. I really enjoyed this movie."
"81",2,"  The Shape of Overrated. I just do not see why this won best picture and director."
"82",4.5,"  A spectacular and beautiful fairy tale made for modern audiences. Sally Hawkins as the mute central character puts in a stunning performance and is matched every step of the way by the largely underrated Doug Jones who's physical performance as the Amphibian Man is every bit as raw and emotional as the human characters. The Cold War story line of a Russian spy in the ranks detracts from the core of the film and had it been removed, the story would have played out in exactly the same way, begging the question of why it was there in the first place. A magnificent love story told in a loving manner."
"83",1,"  Corny story line. Didnt get into any of these characters."
"84",5,"  4.5/5. A unique, powerful, and gorgeous film that deserved its Oscar gold. If you think the protagonists' characterizations (Elisa, Giles, & Zelda) are lacking when compared to the villain (Strickland), think about this: writer-director Guillermo del Toro said they form one character, bringing together three voices from characters that were often silenced in monster movies of yore. It's weird, definitely. If you can open your mind, you might just enjoy this excellent flick."
"85",2,"  Visually artistic, story-wise overrated."
"86",1.5,"  Can't believe this movie won an Oscar and has so many good reviews! I loved Pan Labyrinth and fantasy movies in general but this one lacked character dimensions. Predictable and often illogical."
"87",0.5,"  A fascinating fairy tale was ruined by gratuitous, mean-spirited brutality. This movie should have been given an X rating, not an academy awards! The Academy seems to be obsessed with being politically correct. Why are we not all offended by the horrific images left by this movie? Hitler would have loved it!"
"88",3,"  Weird drama with a semi interesting story, many more deserving productions for the Oscar again this year, still far better than Moonlight."
"89",5,"  Wonderfully shot film..."
"90",5,"  loved it. I haven't seen a movie quite like this , beautifully done and kept me engaged the whole time ."
"91",0.5,"  A miserable movie. I can't believe that this movie won best picture. It is dark and simplistic. I felt agitated throughout. Usually I can see a movie that such an overwhelming majority of people rate highly - and know I'll enjoy it at some level - but no, no. no fun. no mystery. no humor. I don't understand it. I want my money back."
"92",0.5,"  What a boring plot can't believe they wasted so much money on the retro scenes."
"93",5,"  Beautiful film... well deserved oscar"
"94",3,"  visually intriguing and emotionally disturbing"
"95",1.5,"  This movie won the Oscar?! The field must have been pretty weak, or it was an honorary hand out. There was nothing unpredictable. I didn't come away going, ""wow! I never thought about that that way!"" I didn't learn anything. It was an action film with the hook of Elisa's handicap. Fishman's eyes made me want to barf. I get the ""neither of us can talk but we can hear"" bond. I give it 1 of its 1.5 stars for the cinematography. Compare it to Coco...yeah I'm a gringo, but I learned a lot about and discovered new respect for the Day of the Dead ritual. The concept of the remember me song and being forgotten was amazing. So many links in that chain. Unpredictability. The Shape of Water didn't hold a candle to it. I was crying for the last 15 minutes of Coco. I was averting my eyes to the gratuitous violence in the last 15 minutes of this movie. I expect Best Picture to be at least as good as Best Animated. Not even close."
"96",3,"  Ok film about forbidden love, just didn't feel Oscar worthy at times. it has impressive visuals and a strong cast, but the story comes off as slow, muddled, and at times even just plain corny."
"97",5,"  I thought the movie was perfectly made. Wasn't boring not by all means I can't wait until they come out with a 2nd one"
"98",4,"  This is fantasy with wonderful scenes , love story, and deep human drama. The relationship between ""him"" and others is the key of this film. It was really interesting."
"99",3.5,"  Very good, heartfelt and at times gripping drama. Visually really gets the feel of 1962 down and the performances are all top notch. But, and it's a big one ... as with so many movies today it is just TOO long. They could have cut 30 minutes and it would have lost nothing. In fact, it would have probably been a better, tighter story arc. SPOILER ALERT - as pointed out by my brother, who I watched this with, they keep the creature ""captive"" in Elisa's apartment for way too long on the thin pretext they need to wait for rain. Why couldn't they just drive down to the ocean?! Worth seeing, but not as good as some of del Toro's other works.PS For what it's worth, the love story element is the mirror opposite of the one in the movie ""Dagon"", a take on Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" - a thrilling, weird, horror flick well worth seeing."
"100",3,"  I liked the acting and most of the plot. There were some twists that kept me guessing. This is not my fave genre but the cinematography was well done."
"101",3,"  I enjoyed it. Wasn?t perfect but was good"
"102",1,"  How could such a stupid plot win so many awards????? A sea creater and a human falling in love."
"103",2.5,"  *SPOILERS*VISUALLY, a strikingly beautiful and stunning pastiche of better films. A painfully obvious direct ripoff and patchwork reassembly of SPLASH and the Dutch short film THE SPACE BETWEEN US. Even the title of the short film is perfectly echoed in one of the feature film's most iconic shots. Even the recurring verdant sets clearly derivative of Edward Hopper's ""The Nighthawks"", which I kept expecting to see as an Easter egg on a wall. Unfortunately, this flagrant copy breaks no new ground in terms of storytelling. The plot feel and characterization are remarkably shallow. The underlying MESSAGE, strongly anti-white, anti-capitalist, and anti-Christian. The utterly detestable Michael Shannon plays the villain, who is painstakingly painted as a married white Christian male. We got it. And as a cheat, a hypocrite, a racist, a sadist, a misogynist, and a rapey sexual pervert. He despises women, even as he uses them only for sexual gratification and menial labor. He commits anti-Christian acts at every turn whilst paying lip service to God. He is so racist that even his blackening, gangrenous fingers offend him so much he rips them off his body. THEMATICALLY, strong arcs of bestiality and homosexuality complete the anti-Christian mix. Even the mechanism of copulation between fish-man and human-fish-woman was carefully described to make sure we couldn't miss it. A gratuitous masturbation scene was thrown in, presumably to make us understand Sally Hawkins' character was lonely and rejected. We got it. The pro-Communist theme completed by the hero of the film being a Russian communist spy. The American military depicted as crude, unthinking fascists bent on jingoism and evil-doing. The lonely outcasts of society were showcased and denigrated aplenty, with a particularly gruesome mockery of mute persons.STRUCTURALLY, a shot-for-shot ripoff of the aforementioned films, with storyboards you could lay on top of each other and identically trace. The twist was obvious from the beginning, and the entire film very predictable.ACTING was top shelf. Octavia Spencer was her typical likeable and comedic self and did a very fine job. Sally Hawkins and the rest of the cast were also excellent.Highly overrated, with the thefts and warts overlooked due to the trending politically correct anti-American and anti-Christian themes, and other SJW-ish factors. It would be far more enjoyable to one who is blind to, or agrees with its messages, and who has never seen SPLASH and doesn't know about the blatant theft from the short film. I couldn't overcome the negatives and was left feeling disappointed and ripped off.**.25/*****. 92/75. PASS."
"104",1.5,"  What is the big deal here? Best picture? Probably will get forgotten like Moonlight, Shakespere in Love, Birdman and a host of other recent best pic winners. It was interesting, but kind of boring and very very predictable. Visuals were overdone in a 1950's way. Bland and Blah."
"105",4.5,"  A truly captivating unorthodox love story that pushes the lesson so severely that love can truly come out of nowhere and can become anything."
"106",3,"  It's highly ovverrated. Critics like it, God knows why! As an audience member it's like a weirder version of Beauty and the Beast, and darker too. Too bloody and ronchy for my liking. Kinda awkward too, like the movie ""amelie"""
"107",0.5,"  92% tomatometer rating?? very telling who Rotten Tomatoes serves. Makes one skeptical of RT's reviews. As for the movie...only movie so far that i actually want my money back."
"108",0.5,"  this script was written by a kindergartener daughterr of a sjw with a crayon"
"109",5,"  Guillermo del Toro's career to date has produced fantasy movies with a dark, oddball quality that makes him a unique figure at the moment. The Shape of Water continues this style and is recognisably his movie but is, I think at least, the sweetest and most heartwarming of his works to date. Yes, there are still some grim scenes that made me squirm uncomfortably in my seat but the overall feel I left with was of a magical and tender story and a perfectly crafted piece of cinema. Sally Hawkins has a smile that could melt the iciest heart and is simply charming as the dumb cleaning lady Eliza, who falls in love with an amphibious creature that is being studied in a military laboratory. The story is populated by a number of characters who are ostracised by the 1960s American society in which the story unfolds. A particular delight is Octavia Spencer as Zelda, Eliza's co-worker who often acts as her interpreter. This is a touching and heartwarming allegory which is very deserving of all the praise and awards it has gathered over the past few months since it was released. I am sure this will become a firm favourite for years to come."
"110",5,"  Everything comes together in this film to make it ""Best Picture."" Story, acting, cinematography, music, and special effects just wonderful."
"111",0.5,"  Guillermo:I really , really want the best picture oscar, It must be mineFlunky :How about you do a movie about a disabled immigrant lesbian who gets to urinate on donald trumps head for 90 mins straight, its a sure thing.Guillermo:I think we can be 1% more subtle than that my fawning brown nosed friend"
"112",5,"  AMAZING MOVIE DESERVES EVERY WIN !"
"113",2,"  Just.. Awful..Beastiality, Disgusting dead fingers and decapitated felines and a rip off of the terrible Creature from the black lagoon live show at universal studios storyline.2017 must've been a particularly bad year for movies for this to win any kind of award."
"114",1.5,"  Seemed pretty formulaic. Definitely over rated"
"115",5,"  A wonderfully imaginative story told in a very beautiful way. Tale as old as time, an unrequited love affair, this Guillermo del Toro fantasy drama not only features incredible acting by the remarbke pool of talent but also an amazing production overall. From color grading to sound design to set, costume and make up. Watching this film, I felt exported into the magical world Del Toro created, overfilled with joy and excitement, sadness and heartbreak, thrill and resolve. It ticks every box for me."
"116",1.5,"  Meh...It didnt do it for me. I think even a Meh is a bit too much credit."
"117",3.5,"  A moving fairy tale that mixers enough reality to keep you engaged in the fanciful story."
"118",5,"  ""The Shape of Water"" is directed with such imaginative and artistic vision that matches an emotionally deep and engaging story that touches intriguing themes."
"119",5,"  excellent excellent stuff. the whole cast is perfect"
"120",5,"  TODAY in Tokyo is very cold, rain and snow. Natually Cherry Blossoms will bloom this weekend. National holiday and Lady's discount day, The Shape of Water is full seated also for Oscars. Chatters are noisy. At the beginning, all quiet and concentrates in the deep story. The Shape of Water is a scene in Baltimore at Cold War. I remember visit TO Maryland UNIVERSITY before. Sensitive Asset < Creature < Friend < Lover; Face transforms terror to fascinate. This is filled with Love for cinemas LIKE LA LA LAND. Pan's Labyrinth is ALSO my favorite. Applause GUILLERMO Del Toro World! Welcome to my TWitter @CINEMAWISHTOKYO"
"121",3,"  its a pretty good movie"
"122",5,"  Magnificent, enchanting, moving!!"
"123",2,"  This was a ridiculous movie, even with the understanding that it was fantasy. Can't wait for the sequel when she has the baby creature from the black lagoon"
"124",2.5,"  don't really get the hype behind this movie.. I thought it was rather boring. the Story is predictable at every turn, the acting is average.. I know it won best movie at the oscars...but...why?"
"125",5,"  Fabulous touching film.."
"126",1.5,"  An adult disney movie under different production banner. Most of the characters were one dimensional except for the russian spy/scientist."
"127",2,"  Being deep underwater is a good metaphor for this movie and the state the world is in right now. It is easy, while immersed in water, to lose sight which way is up. I hate to see what kind of movie gets best picture at the Oscars ten years from now. Nothing will be taboo in the near future."
"128",2.5,"  While this was dreamy from the start, with a lovely opening sequence, the overall film was a bit underwhelming and overly violent IMO, which was disappointing considering all the fanfare."
"129",5,"  such a BIZARRE love story so wonderful, full of unique characters, making unique relationships beautifully weird film"
"130",3,"  I thought it was dumb. the egg eating creature and the sci fi was kinda ridiculous. the creature is total sci fi.....the time is total sci fi......regular bathrooms can hold tens of thousands of pounds of water, but then the next thing, down the hall, everything is just as contemporary and normal as a day in kansas.....so which is it? a sci fi adventure thriller, or a contemporary drama with a woman falling in love with a sea creature,.....so basically it made no sense. acting was not all that."
"131",3,"  Impeccably made, but I needed to fall in love with the fish man, just like she did. He didn't do anything to endear me to him."
"132",2,"  bORING AND PRETENTIOUS LITTLE FILM"
"133",4.5,"  I really loved this movie. Great acting and Ia wonderful story and characters. The sets were outstanding, the period 1960/s was so well done."
"134",1,"  Predictable and hokey"
"135",0.5,"  I didn't like it at all"
"136",2.5,"  A bad remake of ""The Beauty and the beast"". The Oscars won are just the demonstration of how poor the academy's judgmet can become when a diector makes a politcal film during the ""Trump era""..."
"137",2,"  A little too heavy handed and simplistic for me. When the bad guys are that incredibly bad, I can help but roll my eyes. I need a bit more subtlety."
"138",5,"  Unusual, wouldn't say the best movie ever but definitely deserved an oscar for best picture. Brilliant acting, a lot of love, sadness, anger and the sad truth the way humanity would be towards a creature. Definitely a movie masterpiece."
"139",3.5,"  Zoophilia with extra steps"
"140",2,"  Way too goofy and too Hollywood.Frankenstein meets La La Land in an unserious campy film noir treatment."
"141",4,"  The visuals are extremely beautiful, and capture you with its strong lead character, and story telling, however it did have some questionable moments."
"142",0.5,"  Don't waste your time on this fantasy."
"143",5,"  The Shape of Water accurately portrays the best and worst of humanity. We really enjoyed it"
"144",2,"  A subpar remake of ""Beauty and the Beast"" at its best, ""The Shape of Water"" was too cliche. The reasoning of characters does not make any sense and tender moments were heavily influenced."
"145",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is undeniably odd, but also incredibly original. The cast, storyline, cinematography and special effects combined make this film a masterpiece! Sally Hawkins offers one of the best performances in the film."
"146",4,"  Reviewed 1.19.18. You either get it, or you don't. It's a movie for romantic, oddball, nerdy, campy...outsiders. Don't check off most of those boxes? Then probably not for you. It's an indie that borders on B-movie territory, yet is populated by Hollywood elite actors, and helmed by idiosyncratic director Guillermo Del Toro. What's not to like? Everything, or nothing. Depends on whether you'd make love to a benevolent sea creature that digs Glenn Miller, sticks to a high protein diet, and is man enough to ballroom dance. One ticket please."
"147",2.5,"  This film would've worked a lot better film if Octavia Spencer was cast as the lead. The female lead was too old and definitely not charming enough."
"148",2.5,"  Over rated it's so-so"
"149",1,"  What the hell did I just watch. Two and a half hours of high-budget virtue-signaling and fish porn, I guess..."
"150",4,"  Solid. Definitely not quite as good as the professional reviewers thought it was - but yes still top quality here. Certainly not the best film of 2017, but people can't agree on everything. I give it like an 88 out 100. Not 92, as the tomatometer has it on 3/18/2018."
"151",5,"  It was a good movie. Best movie of the year? IDK. But it was pretty good. It could have BENEFITED from more visual appeal - it could have been more beautiful than it was. Also, the fish man looked VERY fake. Like a muppet actually. I mean they needed Avatar level effects for the fish man, but failed, so he looked fake."
"152",1,"  disgusting....worst 10 euros ever spend.....if i wished for animal porn i would googled it :D"
"153",4.5,"  Great movie, some stuff didn't need to be in there."
"154",5,"  Like all great fairy tales, there is usually more going on beneath the surface. The Shape of Water, with it's socially charged subtext and breathtaking performances, is a must see for fans of Del Toro as well as fans of cinema. Definitely recommended."
"155",4,"  one of those movies where the trailers/reviews really didn't give you a sense of what it was about. Much more humor than I had expected. Richard Jenkins was great. it was sweet, and nostalgic, but not syrupy."
"156",3.5,"  I am really happy that the main character was someone with a disability. I really liked how it was set in the 50's. and that it showed some of the fashion and so some of the cars of the decade."
"157",3.5,"  With its interesting visual style, I can see why this made it in the Oscar's. I didn't love the story, though - I just wasn't very invested in the relationship (Hawkins explaining their relationship to Jenkins, though, was stellar).This is sort of like a modern fairytale, I guess. It mixes so many elements - fantasy, noir, drama ... It's difficult to categorise but that's hardly a negative."
"158",0.5,"  Meandering meh... Boring with,, just weird but not in a good way.. Oh and sick of the constant the bad white Christian villain garbage.. pass on this.. a rerun of your favorite tv show is better time spent"
"159",1.5,"  Another Hollywood freak show movie. Meaningless and a waste of time."
"160",5,"  Brilliant story, incredible cinematography, with so much meaning permeating through. Really enjoyed it, especially the quote at the end which brings it all together! - ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, For You are everywhere."""
"161",0.5,"  Well cast and well acted really bad movie. Ridiculous plot. Del Toro imust laughing all the way to the bank. 1/2 star is generous."
"162",2.5,"  Predictable, unbelievable, and boring for a group that saw it."
"163",3,"  Not bad, but Best Picture?? I don't get it!! Especially with Darkest Hour in the running"
"164",0.5,"  I think I am the only human being among my friends that did not like this movie at all. In my opinion this movie is highly disturbing. a human having sex with a unknown aquatic creature... Not to mention the unnecessary scenes of sex, masturbation and nudity..."
"165",2,"  I found this movie boring and the characters one dimensional and cliched. Nice to look at but lipstick on a pig. Hard to make it to the end. The leftist agenda was too obvious and annoyingly distracting. Very disappointed. I liked Pan's Labyrinth better. ."
"166",0.5,"  Sucked, terrible plot. Apparently, human life is worthless when they are only doing their job."
"167",4.5,"  Whenever Guillermo del Toro is working on dark fantasy films, that is like the one thing I want to see more out of him. But that's not me saying that fantasy is the only thing he's good at. I enjoyed his action blockbuster films, (such as the ""Hellboy"" movies and 2013's ""Pacific Rim""). I never got the chance to see his last movie, ""Crimson Peak,"" (which many people are considering it as del Toro's disappointing film). Well, actually, the only least movie he has ever made, in my opinion, was ""Mimic."" I never find his plot and characters of ""Mimic"" to be very interesting, but I realized that del Toro wasn't at all impressed with it either, due to the fact that the Weinstein Company didn't appreciate his vision. Now, he comes up with another dark fantasy film called ""The Shape of Water,"" and the first thing I can say about it is that this is easily his best film since his masterpiece, ""Pan's Labyrinth.""Set in the Cold-War era, Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute, lonely janitor who works at a secret laboratory, and spends her time with her gay neighbor and artist, Giles (Richard Jenkins), whenever she's not working. One day, her life started to change when she and her co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), have discovered a captured creature (Doug Jones) in the lab. Elisa becomes friends with the creature, but as far as their friendship goes, the two of them starts falling in love with each other.Many people were thinking to themselves that this film must be a spinoff to ""Hellboy,"" based on how the creature looked very similar to Abe Sapien. But keep in mind, I knew, right before I saw this movie, that this was pretty much another dark fantasy film by Guillermo del Toro. The concept of the film is heavily inspired by ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" but besides that film, there are also many things to explore in ""The Shape of Water."" It's very easy to see the similarities between this film and ""Pan's labyrinth."" It also features a lot of biblical references and many other classic films, (which I don't want to get into any details about it because I do feel like it'd be me giving away the film). For all of its themes, elements, and the entire cast, this film manages to be so well done because of those things. Recognizing her from movies like ""Happy-Go-Lucky,"" (which was the film she won a Golden Globe for her role), Sally Hawkins's portrayal as Elisa is memorizing. The way how we see her communicating through sign language and the way how she expresses her emotions for herself is undeniably amazing. Even though I like the relationship between Elisa and the creature, I actually like the friendship between her and Giles more. Like the friendship between Ofelia and Mercedes in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" that's exactly what I feel about their friendship in ""The Shape of Water."" Richard Jenkins delivers a warm, gentle performance as Giles, and he and Sally Hawkins deserve to be praised for what they've done in the film.I wouldn't say that Michael Shannon's character, Colonel Strickland, is about as unsettling as Captain Vidal in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but like some of his best performances, he is devilish good when it comes to playing an antagonist quite like this one. Another performance that everyone's been praising is Octavia Spencer, (better known from ""The Help"" and ""Hidden Figures). At first, I never see anything special about her character, but as time goes on, I started to see something out of her character, (which, again, that'd be me giving away the film). Michael Stuhlbarg does a fine job as a scientist who's secretly a soviet spy. He's very similar to Dr. Ferreiro in ""Pan's Labyrinth.""The only input I have with ""The Shape of Water"" is the third act. While it ends on a sweet note, I've found it to be a little too rushed for me. But as much as I love ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" there is so much great imagination that I can't ignore. My full opinion: 9.3/10."
"168",4,"  An absolutely stunning film, featuring beautiful photography, excellent production design and a great soundtrack. The entire cast is phenomenal and the story itself is a brilliant piece of screenwriting in terms of themes, characters and plot. It's a wonderfully resonant movie and a completely immersive experience: taut and relaxing, real and surreal, unsettling and sweet, it's the definition of memorable."
"169",0.5,"  No..just no. This movie is proof that fredom of expression and speach wil be banned in the not to distent future. Leftwing propaganda is the only way i can difine this abomination."
"170",3,"  This movie is an interesting attempt to mingle disparate genres: a fantasy creature and fairy-tale-love story arc, cold-war intrigue, and a modern take on the faults of early 1960s white all-americanism. The result is an interesting blend of tropes, but, unfortunately, for me it lacked the feeling of having created something really novel through the effort. Oh well, the plot is still nicely woven together and the performances are good."
"171",1.5,"  Overrated for sure. This beat Dunkirk for best picture at the Oscars? Too much a political agenda at the awards show. Okay, I have no problem with putting a message in a film so long as the movie is entertaining and watchable. While sets, music, costumes and acting were good, Del Toro usually does a better job of story-telling. So much was predictable with this film and so much is wrong! Del Toro takes many swipes at the ""bad guys"" but delivers no knock out punch as this film just doesn't work. Again Del Torno makes the man in unifom the bad guy. Forget what such people did in two world wars to protect the rest of civilization and keep totlitarianism away, Hollywood is so busy trashing ""old ways"" they neglect the real monsters circling outside the walls. Del Toro takes a Lovecraftain Dagon monster and recasts him as something loveable but the romance is built up with little substance (or even emotion) behind it. The two ""oppressed lovers"" go though an adventure that will likely please malcontents everywhere but the story is too weak to truly make it enjoyable. I agree with other critics - it is a poor remake of the the movie Splash."
"172",4.5,"  Elisa yg bisu dan kesepian, tdk menghalangi dirinya sendiri utk mencari & menemukan makna persahabatan & cinta-kasih sejati dr kehidupan situasi maupun kondisi dmn dia berada. Ketulus-ikhlasannya siap dibayar."
"173",1,"  Too much nudity/porn-ish references. This movie could have been a lot better without hte nudity and violence. And they wonder why kids shoot up schools when this is the kind of crap Hollyweird feeds them. The actress was great (prefer her NOT to be naked). Too much digital crap. Makes me wish for the movies from the 40s and 50s."
"174",3,"  This is a movie that I appreciated more than I liked. The love story between a mute woman and a fish god is beautifully directed and acted. As the mute woman, Sally Hawkins makes melancholy beautiful. Octavia Spencer, as her best friend, is a stand-in for the audience and a welcome dose of comic relief. All the elements are present. But, and it's a big but, it doesn't add up in the long run. The chemistry between Hawkins and the fish just isn't there--the reason for the romance is that ""he doesn't see she is broken,"" not the greatest reason for love. And the graphic sex scenes and violence pulls you out of the elegant visual feast on display. One sex scene has a naked Hawkins getting it on with the fish while the bathroom fills with water to the ceiling from an overflowing tub. This simply is impossible and requires an epic suspension of disbelief. Not the sex part--that a overflowing tub could make a bathroom into an aquarium. And the side story with the great Michael Stuhlbarg makes zero sense. I had high hopes going into the film and give it the rating I did based on degree of difficulty, but I recommend it with very strong reservations."
"175",1,"  EWWWW... this could have been a good movie but they added unnecessary elements to it. I am mad that it won so many awards. I did like the use of Sign language though"
"176",2,"  An inspired fairy tale that winds up pretentious and mundane."
"177",1,"  Unable to emotionally connect with a guy in a plastic suit. Disappointingly bad."
"178",4,"  4/5 starsI went into this expecting to not like it. I tend to find Guillermo del Toro's movies to be too strange and not that interesting. But I really enjoyed this. There were several very strong acting performances, including both Sally Hawkins (she was able to communicate so much without words) and Octavia Spencer.The movie was interesting and touching."
"179",3,"  La forma del agua [2017]"
"180",2,"  Another beauty and the beast. Forced myself to finish watching."
"181",3,"  Best picture?? Not really..."
"182",1,"  Absolute load of rubbish. God knows what the academy members were smoking. Maybe deep and meaningful to a 12 year old but is actually a load of nonsense. Avoid."
"183",4,"  Beautifully Directed And Acted, The Shape Of Water Is That Strange Movie, With A Deeply Touching Story That Can Outcome It's Strangeness.It's Cinematography And Visuals Are Also Fantastic Proving Again That Del Toro Is A Very Talented Man."
"184",5,"  Beautiful movie, I didn't anticipate that I would enjoy the story. I was expecting another mundane superhero movie or worse a less than stellar remake of the ""creature from the black lagoon."" This was not that at all. The love story, and witnessing how the duality of human nature can both inspire as well as corrupt, even when your intentions are good."
"185",3.5,"  The production is top quality, from costume, casting, to music. A well directed film and an unique love story. I think the movie had a creature that could be a focal point in multiple films. Not my favorite movie from 2017, but a solid film."
"186",5,"  there is one word for this film, a fucking masterpiece. The shape of water is one of the most amazing and beautiful film like no other. Its a dark romantic film I can tell you that but its a beautiful dark romantic film with a story that is so poetic and artistic that it will engage you plus I love the visuals in the film very beautiful and the design of the creature very well done I like that. The characters in the film are very likable like zelda and of course Elisa she remains me like Ofelia in Pan's labyrinth but a grown up version of herself which is awesome. Plus I love the whole 1960's look in the film which is very cool and I like that in movies now that is how you make a good film. Overall The shape of water is a beautiful dark romantic and also a artistic film like no other with amazing visuals, lovable characters, and a well crafted and beautiful dark story that is truly amazing and magical and I love that sooo much. Well done Guillermo del Toro you made yet again a beautiful and a very dark romantic and also a artistic film that is truly a masterpiece of a film and you my friend are a awesome film maker and this film I really love it and I will say it again, a fucking masterpiece. Good job and well done. Best film ever and really the best film of 2017 period."
"187",2.5,"  I have watched a lot of movies over 60 years. I am surprised that an old 60s style B movie is propelled to an Oscar. I don't get it despite having apreciated many an arthouse film."
"188",3,"  You can tell the directing and acting are very good, however, other than a woman falling in love with a fish-man, it's the same plot as tons of other movies. Even the twist at the end seems tired."
"189",3,"  Too predictable, bit boring,"
"190",0.5,"  One critic called it soft core fish porn and he was right. More from the liberal hate machine the director so adeptly satisfies."
"191",5,"  ????????????????????????????????"
"192",0.5,"  I registered an account so I can leave a comment. It was such a terrible film, the story was bazaar and having sex with the water creature was so creepy. Have to say the acting from all actors was really good, the scenes were beautiful, only the storyline was cringe."
"193",4,"  The movie is great and amazing but isn't the best. The story is calculable. The perfomance is amazing too. For example: Sally Hawkins or Michael Shannon. I love this movie. This is an adult story with love and brutality."
"194",3,"  This movie is all the rage in the Oscars. So I give it a watch. To me its ...Meh... The premise is not too bad and mood is definable grimy Del Toro style. But I found the story plot BORING. you know whats going to happen so basically when you are watching the flick its just like going thru the motion. So yeah once again the so called professional critics are fawning over something mediocre.."
"195",1.5,"  Not sure why this won so many awards...sure it's beautifully directed, but as far as misunderstood monster movies go...it fails to break new ground"
"196",0.5,"  Nothing but inappropriate comments and scenes. Very odd movie and definitely not the best movie of the year."
"197",5,"  Film of the year! 2017 has given us brilliant coming of age stories like Lady Bird or horror satire like Get Out. We got scares and coming of age stories in It, now Guillermo del Toro enchants the heart with his romantic horror masterpiece The Shape of Water.Sally Hawkins is magnificent as the mute maid Eliza. You will fall in love with her and empathize with her terrible longing and heartfelt desires. Hawkins deserves the Oscar for leading actress for her performance.Doug Jones is captivating as the water creature, perceptive in his movements and facial signals. He brilliantly matches Hawkins' subtle acting. Their faces, mouths, eyes, and hand movements engage you without words.Michael Shannon delivers the villainous performance of a lifetime as the terrifying, yet thrillingly shrewd government agent. You realize he is the true monster of this fairy tale.Alexandre Desplat's score will delight your eyes with gentle and rousing classical music that perfectly fits the tone of the film. It's swells enchant with sonic magic and the subtle music cues parallel the passionate emotions on screen.Guillermo del Toro has surpassed the majesty and mystique of his previous landmark in horror film, Pan's Labyrinth, in spectacular fashion. He should be proud of crafting a movie that is simultaneously, gorgeous to gaze upon, and thrilling to witness. Go see The Shape of Water in theaters immediately! You have never had a cinematic experience quite like this film."
"198",5,"  My husband and our two dearest friends watched this movie last night. The results split right down gender lines. The two women loved it and the two men not so much. Although very predictable, it was a beautiful, and very original love story. I would highly recommend it."
"199",0.5,"  I find extremely disturbing that this movie got nominated and won as best picture from movie industry professionals. the whole movie is a copy-paste from at least ten other successful movies that are impossible to miss. i find unacceptable from a director like del toro to paste together pieces of other movies to create a new one and that no one cries scandal."
"200",4,"  This movie actually felt more original then most movies these days. Held my interest. I loved how the main character didn't even have to speak. I liked how it took place in the 60's. Visually I liked the film, over all I enjoyed it a lot more then I thought I would."
"201",1,"  Life draining crap of a movie, if you thought that ""The English patient"" was a complete soul sucking waste of your finite time on earth you will feel the same about this one."
"202",0.5,"  The Shape Of Water...from a director I used to respect and like, a complete garbage of a white saviour film masquerading as a liberal artsy piece...AKA how to try and fail to be Avatar/ET. Every single character in this film is a stereotype - written from the perspective of a straight white man trying and failing to portray the voice of the oppressed. We have caricatures at every turn - from the deliberately unempowered and literally voiceless, doe-eyed female Latino cleaner Eliza who feels a desperate need to become a saviour but who ends up getting saved, to the magical negro trope in Zelda, to the un-empathetic and law abiding male in her husband, to the evil Caucasian American Gestapo man who rapes his wife, who's only there to make dinner, look pretty and get raped (a rape that's there as a trope, for which there is no consequence), to the 'savage' from the rainforest that is a literal depiction of a white supremacist colonial mindset of the oppressed, needing to be rescued, to the gay neighbour ('the gay sidekick') who suddenly decides to help save a creature he's never seen before because he's rejected by a man in a diner, to the moustache twirling Russians, to the overt female nudity and objectification for which there is no male counterpart. Eliza is such a blank canvas of a personality with no backstory besides being an orphan that her only desire and purpose in this film is to save the 'man' she loves...because obviously female leads are only really concerned with love and men. The experience of oppression is nuanced and varies from person to person - being female or gay, or black, are not the same thing and it's simplistic to bulk every oppressed caricature in the film and gang them up against a cardboard cut-out of an evil white man. Like Three Billboards, a Hollywood wet dream and a shit show of lazy, ignorant stereotypes that does more damage than good."
"203",3,"  The good - production design, camerawork - is sadly outweighed by the bad - a treacly sentimentality and ludicrous plot. It's true I'm not a fan of Del Toro and at least this isn't Pacific Rim, but it's outrageous that this lengthy hybrid of ET and a fifties Norman Wisdom filler beat Phantom Thread and Three Billboards to Best Picture. If you enjoyed Lassie you'll love this."
"204",2,"  Very disappointed with this film. I really had high hopes. I heard so many great things about it. The cinematography was good. I just found it really boring. Very formulaic. I've never really been a fan of Guillermo del Toro anyway. His movies are sometimes pretty to look at but have very little substance. I thought this one might be different but I was wrong. I really don't understand the hype on this one."
"205",2.5,"  And Oscar really?One Oscar would've been a stretch, several Oscars???it's obvious that the fish was sleeping with somebody else ..........."
"206",0.5,"  1/2 star (only because I don't award zero stars)The way they see this villain is the way they see all non-leftists.Honestly, would be 5 stars if it ended the moment he shot them.Words cannot convey how bad this is. The cheerfulness of The Triumph of the Will, and a similar intent (kill the people who stand in the way of our perfect world of ""love"").I'm just going to end up writing a point by point dissertation about everything that makes this such an abortion of a movie...First scene is masturbatory. Obligatory gay mentor. Sassy black woman. Fart jokes. Uptight religious man. Old southern racist white villain. Weapon crazy. Sympathetic communists. Virtue signaling about civil rights. Equating humans with animals. Impugning moral cognizance to animals. Bestiality. Pagan worship. Inherent goodness. This is everything garbage about hollywood. One of the most one-dimensional, virtue-signalling movies I've ever seen. In Splash, she had to become human for sex. Not so, in today's hollywood. smh. No build up. No character complexity. Everything just happens all at once. It's horrible storytelling. Does anyone know how it got there & what it's doing there? Get a puppy! Just don't f it.It displays the selfishness of such people. She wants water sex, despite the damage it will do to the building and neighbors.The idea that a bathroom could stay filled with via towels on the floor is so banally stupid as to be insulting. The 21st century woman. Profane and perverted. Like Kimmel said, the only ""good"" men are gay, soviets, or fish. Pre-torture monologuing villain cliche is such poor writing. Truly, I could never love someone who loved this movie. Additionally, the crap writing of never explaining the scars. But everything else is so bad, a narrative misstep is the least of the problems.""God looks human like you... well, maybe more like me.""They thought this was clever? Seriously, who votes on this? Puerile, banal, cartoon drama. So overplaying the foreign empathy card as to do away with any semblance of reality. Mawkish. They became bff's after one meeting. Cause sea creatures are so common and easily understood. The worst kind of puerile hollywood schlock.Del Toro also overplays his hand in characterizing the heroes. Midway into the film, he reveals that Giles is gay when the character makes a pass at a friendly restaurant owner; the latter promptly kicks Giles out of the restaurant, along with a black couple who want to eat there. Though superfluous to the story, the scene reflects the movie's mission, to inspire sympathy with outsiders and anger toward anyone who would prevent them from experiencing love. This simplistic reduction of cold war-era society divides people into open-minded dreamers and narrow-minded villains. del Toro lays it on so thick that there's no room for counterargument or even independent thought. Ultimately his perspective is every bit as confining as the giant tank housing the creature at the lab, The best movie is now the one which makes me feel most righteous about myself for being a neo-Marxist left-winger. That's it. There is no other criteria.Too comfortable with itself to create any real dramatic tension.The film's heroes are so tolerant that they don't think to question the notion of a woman hooking up with a member of another species...del Toro isn't willing to acknowledge uncertainty or emotional or moral fallibility on the part of his heroesWithout a moment's hesitation, the fish is literally choosing which crappy jazz records to listen to her with. I'm supposed to take this seriously as art. Obligatory bigotry scene that has nothing to do with the story, except that it makes identity politicians feel good about themselves.""Just because I'm being nice, doesn't mean I want to be assaulted, gay neighbor.""If you have family values that don't include sodomy, you're probably a racist.Soviet spy will teach us about immigration.""I like that you're a mute, cuz I don't want my women speaking!"" Gimme a break.I was going for hands on hips pee guy because I felt sympathy for him for being written so one-dimensionally.I'm allowed to commit felony crime if I feel emotional about something.Hollywood demonstrated again that a movie doesn't actually have to be good to win best picture. It only has to offer the opportunity for liberal moral self-congratulation. #OscarsIt looked at her nice, so she obviously needs to keep it & prevent humanity to learn about a new species' biology. The irony is, it's only an immaterialist moral system that puts individual self-worth over collective. However, gillmen don't actually exist.I'm going to murder a human to save the life of an animal, under biological study. They should all hang.Happily ever after movies are usually panned by critics. I guess you have to be a minority or inter-bestial.These stupid people think that any kind of difference must be grounds for acceptance, not realizing there are considerations to acknowledge first, which they themselves admit to & betray.The plot is your basic disney kids dog pound plot. With added SJW. I love how they're portraying the villains as easily duped by ppl other than special forces... doesn't that take away from the ""heroism"" of the kidnapping?Yes, they're so quick to relate to anyone different....except, you know, the one-dimensional nazis the kill.A cold war movie where the creature & the soviet are the good guys. This is not by accident.And of course, the old familiar morally pure animal trope watching human evil in horror. Of course, the white nuclear family is the one where things are awry. Thank you, hollywood, for defending us from the horrors of suburbia.Bottom line, you can dress up crap, but it's still crap. Even if it's Academy awarded. This is nothing more than fish porn. Make no mistake. This is perversion. It is hollywood."
"207",0.5,"  So bad, I can't even put it in words."
"208",0.5,"  Truly a bad movie. When the synopsis says it is an other-worldly fairy tale, what that means is that the characters do not resemble real world people at all in their attitudes and motivations and that even a small child can guess what will happen just as in a fairy tale. This movie is utter garbage."
"209",4,"  The Shape of Water showcases some of the best of director Guillermo del Toro whose distinct vision and love of cinema shines through in this touching story. The characters and themes of acceptance are strongly represented, with Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer and Doug Jones all doing amazing jobs to completely captivate their characters. The music is moving and distinct while the visuals, including the set design are simply fascinating, making even a soap dispenser alluring. The narrative may be predictable with the stakes and twists not so surprising, but its probably the most complete and neat package awards contenders have offered this year, with the movies perfect length working in its favour."
"210",2,"  Movie was mostly just ""Meh"". Not sure how it received best picture. It is strange, in a good way, but mostly boring. The unnecessary nudity and masturbation scenes also prevents this from being a family movie. The reasoning was some BS from the director claiming some purpose of art or empowerment. Not that I mind nudity, I rather enjoy it, but at least say hey we wanted boobs in this cause it's boring and we need to spice it up."
"211",5,"  Have you ever just watched a movie and have just known that it would be one of your favorites. That was me watching this movie. Every ounce of me loves this movie. From how beautiful it is shot, how an amazing job the director did with it, the absolutely perfect acting, and the unique and beautiful story. Everything about this movie is perfect to me. For ever I have always said that The Dark Knight is my favorite movie but I can say that without a doubt that The Shape of Water is my new favorite film. If you haven't seen it you need to. This is a film fans movie."
"212",0.5,"  Rabid female masturbating, homosexuality, bestiality. What other movie would Hollywood want to select as movie of the year.Skip it Middle America"
"213",0.5,"  How this movie won best picture is beyond me. The directing is excellent, the cinematography is breathtaking. However, the story is unbearably boring. I caught myself checking the run time on several occasions to see how much more I had to sit through."
"214",1,"  I was so disappointed with this movie! The actors and cinematography were wonderful but the story was a combination of Beauty and the Beast, ET and Little Mermaid. And there was too much unjustified graphic violence."
"215",1.5,"  A very well-filmed movie. great acting, directing and cinematography. in the end it is just a very very childish stupid movie with gratuitous nudity and violence. movies where the protagonist loves a fish are gaining oscars nowadays. so sad."
"216",1,"  Boring and obvious. What a disappointment."
"217",4.5,"  Great movie......I haven't argued with someone about the ending of a movie in years....I loved having differing opinions.....and that led to more discussions about different parts of the movie....and so on, and so on.........."
"218",2,"  What a disappointment."
"219",1.5,"  TO SEE OR NOT TO SEE? A big NO!Worst unrealistic watching someone play with her self then have sex with the swamp thing! And it was not worth the price of my ticket OR time! Annihilation was worth the money, not this one. This should of been called playing with myself in the water"
"220",3,"  Very beautiful film, but its message is shallow. Taking a fairy tale and just putting it enough spin to turn it into a My-Little-Ponyish film seems like a tremendous waste of potential. This could have been so much more! Aesthetically, it is flawless, It's just the message that belongs more in a corny direct-to-dvd for kids than in a production of this calibre. I don't mean this message shouldn't be there, but we should get more layers, more complexity, more undertones, more subtext, something to make us want to re-watch The Shape Of Water. Instead we get the same thing hammered at us all throughout the film, and it subtracts a lot from the experience."
"221",0.5,"  boring- obvious-stupid"
"222",4,"  absorbing and Imaginative!"
"223",4,"  Sin ser mi estilo de pelcula favorito (prefiero la ciencia ficcin a la fantasa) me pareci muy buena. La historia es buena, el trabajo de del toro es por dems destacado , la actuacin de Sally hawkins me pareci extraordinaria y creo que no se lle ha hecho justicia a Michael shannon (strickland) cuya actuacin tambin es genial."
"224",3.5,"  I wasn't really convinced by the romance and the story developed in a strange pace. I admire the cinematography and visual effects but overall the script isn't as good as the awards could suggest. enjoyable to watch nevertheless."
"225",4,"  It is surprising that this film is seldom recognized as a woman's sexual fantasy. She is, after all, clearly ""engaged"" as she reclines in her tub. She is also clearly of a certain age when her eggs are nearing their ""use by"" date, so cleverly illustrated by the egg timer. She is dreaming about someone who will want her eggs . Her experience with the opposite sex has not been positive, however. Her Macho boss and her effeminate friend are clearly not suitable so she creates a ""body"" for her eggs. Don't miss Sally Hawkins in ""maudie""."
"226",0.5,"  While hollywood limousine liberals scream and rave about the sexual abuse of women, they simultaneously vote ""best movie of the year"" for this filth. the star appears in full frontal nudity, baring her small breasts and pubic hair, then she proceeds to masterbate in her bathtub. the villain loses two fingers and tells his boss ""i still have my pussy finger"" before he appears on screen, screwing his wife. filthy language, needlessly so, filthy actions, needlessly so. these women demeaned themselves voluntarily. in twenty years, will they complain that they were exploited, as so many others have? it's the way of contemporary ""feminists"" - a one word oxymoron.don't see this trash. it is hollywood vulgarity and ignorance, with a monster strangely identical to a human body in a green camo wetsuit. did i say it was ignorant? that is an understatement."
"227",2,"  15 minutes INTO THE MOVIEW, I TOLD MYSELF ""OK I GET IT, CAN I GO"""
"228",2.5,"  Man, i do not understand how this turkey won best picture. not only is it almost completely bereft of nuance or depth (seriously, i think children would love this film were itn ot for the gratuitous 'adult' elements), it's premise is also frankly gross. and nonsensical. you never get a sense of who elisa nor the fish man are...they don't speak a word, but we're supposed to believe theyre in love because they porked a couple of times? I've heard people praise it for giving an allegorical nod to 'love is love is love' type of stuff, but where *are* our queer characters finding love? And the only racism we see is clearly the product of problematic individuals, rather than anything to do with framing the systems at play that encourage / enable them. i don't know. i didn't care for it at all."
"229",1,"  possibly the dumbest movie ever"
"230",0.5,"  This movie was OK, but not a Oscar worthy movie."
"231",2,"  Weak movie, very hyped"
"232",5,"  touchy and weird...but a bittersweet tale that could lead to tears, well played and emotional...I loved it"
"233",5,"  absolutely beautiful movie"
"234",1.5,"  After the first 40 minutes I said to the 3 other people with us ""for a best picture winner this is awfully slow moving"". Going beyond that, it was hard to get into. I had little empathy for the rationale for the untenable relationship and the over the top intelligence operation. I was bored throughout. the motion picture academy is clearly too easily seduced by old world hollywood musical garnish and fairy tale gobbledygook. That this film won best picture is a travesty. By the way, the picture should have had more to overcome to win best picture by virtue of the fact that it borrowed much of the main concept from the movie splash which was a far more entertaining picture."
"235",2,"  iT was so so boring, almost fell asleep. I like the concept but it need something more to keep my interest."
"236",2.5,"  make love to a fish okay!!!"
"237",5,"  I predicted it would win the oscar for the best film...it did! now it's available on dvd/download. One of my Top Two films of the year! When it's over, you'll say, ""What did I just see?"" You'll be glad you did and you will never forget it! A love story like none other. 13 Oscar nominations, my vote for Best Picture, Director and Actress. You must see it twice!"
"238",4,"  ""The Shape of the Water"" is an lovely movie which tells the love story between a mute woman and a ""weird"" water creature. I think Del Toro shows, once again, all his talent, directing a simple yet poignant movie. I have loved the characters who take part to the story: both Octavia Spencer and Nick Searcy are amazing in their supporting roles. The star, of course, is the unbelievable Sally Hawkins, who's able to portray the mute main character with such a class that's impossible not to fall in love with her.Cinematography and the score are as great as you would expect from a Del Toro's movie. I firmly believe that ""The Shape of the Water"" is by far one of the most interesting movies done in these last 5 years."
"239",2,"  A very pedestrian movie that doesn't deserve all the praise it gets"
"240",3,"  Pan's Labyrinth meets Beauty and the Beast"
"241",1,"  I truly do not understand how this movie got best picture, out of all the movies this year. weird plot. just could not connect. the visuals were great, but it could not make up for the fish sex and cat eating. the only redeeming quality was richard jenkins' character, which i loved and wish we would have seen more of. sorry..."
"242",1.5,"  Although the film had some pluses such as the visuals the reality is that it was underwhelming. The film had so many plot holes that it was almost insulting to a moviegoers intelligence. It was almost like a parody of Beauty and the Beast. It was obvious shallow and overdone"
"243",2.5,"  I thought The Shape of Water was OK. Not amazing. Not great. Not mindblowing. Just a basic OK.Yet it won 4 oscars. Why?Complete story with all spoilers: The Shape of Water is the story of a lonely mute woman working as a janitor in an army facility during the 1950s, who falls for a weird sea man creature who's kept captive there by a heartless army man. With the help of her old gay neighboor artist friend who happens to have a lot of free time on his hand because photographs have rendered his work for the advertising industry obsolete, a russian spy scientist, and her black janitor lady friend, she manages to save the weird sea man from being killed and dissected away. As our mute hero takes care of the beast she somehow falls in love with it and reaches orgasmic bliss. The army man tries to find out what happened, and after first being cluesless eventually manages to figure it out and catches the heroic couple as the beast is about to be released back into the sea. They fight, they all die, but turns out the beast has magical powers that can bring himself and his new lover back to life. They both escape into the sea. The end.The visuals, the actors: all great.The story: kind of OKish.The creepiness level: quite high at times.Is that enough to win an oscar? Apparently it's enough to win 4 of them.Why?Well.This movie is about a team of broken people sticking it up to the man, all to save, and fuck, an alien, who somehow happens to have great magical powers.You can't really get more progressive than this.The traditional white man, with his stay-at-home wife and his 2 kids, is portrayed as a sadistical tyrant with no redeeming quality other than his effectiveness at his job (and he's clearly super triggered when that only quality is being questioned), while the team of mute lady, gay old dude, and fat black girl, are super strong super nice and super good. The alien, a creepy and dangerous cat-eating savage beast, is actually a wonderful lover and some kind of God who can bring back the deads.Add the husband of the black lady who's just useless and pathetic, and the guy from the restaurant that the old gay character is in love with who turns out to reject the gay's advances while at the same time clearly signaling he's a racist intolerant asshole, and you end up with a pretty clear message: kill the old traditional western culture as it has no value whatsoever, and chose instead to embrace savagery because it's actually magical and fucking hot.That is a message that Hollywood loves. Hence the Oscars.And I don't even think this message is *entirely* wrong, but where is the nuance here? There's no nuance at all. And zero nuance is almost always entirely wrong."
"244",2,"  Boring and predictable."
"245",5,"  One of the best films of 2017. No doubt it deserved the best picture"
"246",4,"  Splish, splash, it looks a lot like Beauty and Beast with lots of water. More of a chick flick. Listen up guys! Even if you can't swim, bring the ladies They'll love you for it. !!Can't get enough of Beauty and the Beast......For an $8 ticket, you'll get $9 worth of entertainment."
"247",4,"  ""I do not fail, i deliver"" this film delivers. This is a visually beautiful film. All of the performances are exceptional ,the most of which being Michael Shannon's. Michael Shannon plays a very intelligent antagonist. For example, earlier in the movie he makes a statement about how washing your hands before or after urinating says something about your character. Nothing that he says feels pretentious or forced. The practical effects are great. The only downside to this movie is the gratuitous and unnecessary nudity. It adds nothing of merit or importance to the film, and is used way too often. Overall, this is a visually stunning movie with great performances and amazing storytelling, with it's only flaw being the unnecessary and forced nudity."
"248",2.5,"  I cannot believe that this ""Free Willy"" version from Guillermo del Toro won the oscar for best picture. It is not a bad movie, obviously, but nothing compared to ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The latter is a masterpiece and deserves all the kind of awards you throw at it, the former (the movie in question) is a boring story with some gruesome and unnecessary moments. Watch it if you have 2h to kill, but for a some real good time, choose any other nominated movie at the 90th Academy Awards, BUT this one!"
"249",2.5,"  A crude, aquatic version of beauty and the beast. PLOT WAS WAY TOO EASY TO FIGURE OUT. Was expecting a bit more magic."
"250",0.5,"  Terrible, I hated it,EXTREMELy disturbing. DON'T recommend, its a waste of my 2 hours. And the deaf playing GIRL is so bad at acting,did not deserve the Oscar.??"
"251",3.5,"  noT an amazing film as i had been expecting. Just above average. The criteria for winning an oscar must be verY obscure."
"252",3,"  i liked it. kind of creepy but very unique."
"253",0.5,"  I was expecting this to be a lot better than it was especially after seeIng it won so many oscars. Very disappoinTed. The plot was predictaBle and the story was just Weird and creepy altogether."
"254",4.5,"  Crazy weird but extremely interesting and compelling."
"255",1.5,"  There is no way this movie should've won an oscar! This was noT the best picture! This movie sums up the ridiculousness of the ocars voting!"
"256",1,"  Hard TO BELIEVE THAT THIS FILM WON BEST PIC. AN OVERLONG, TEDIOUS, SEXUALIZED RIP-OFF OF SPLASH, ET, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, SLEEPING BEAUTY, FREE WILLY AND PROBABLY SEVERAL OTHERS THAT DONT COME INSTANTLY TO MIND.- SURE TO MAKE FUTURE LISTS OF THE WORST BEST PICTURE"
"257",4.5,"  Maudie & Ed Sapien avoid face time with General Zod with the help of Sitterson from Cabin in the Woods..."
"258",4,"  OK, is it the finest movie I've ever seen, no. But it is a fine movie none the less. The photography, as with all guillermo movies was first rate! Atmospheric and delicate. The actors were first rate! Michael Shannon continues to shine, no matter the part he plays! the story itself is interesting as the 'lovers' are mute--they are outcasts and prisoners at once and so are drawn into an cross-species bond--yes, you'll find parallels between this and 'beauty and the Beast'. Just go with it and lose yourself."
"259",4.5,"  Uma conto de fadas ao estilo dos seus melhores filmes, Guillermo del Toro faz de ""A Forma da gua"" um triunfo a nvel esttico e cultural, com comentrios sociais que no diluem o impacto do romance central e actuaes de topo que ajudam a cimentar a posio do realizador como o melhor contador de histrias do cinema contemporneo."
"260",1.5,"  Overwelmed by the mediocrity of this film. Best movie, not. It's a hodgepod of ""THE THING' AND ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"" WITH GRATUITUS SEX AND VIOLENCE THROWN INTO AN UNPLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE. cOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MUCH BETTERs"
"261",0.5,"  Too much sexual content"
"262",1.5,"  Two hours of my life I shall never get back. Was the target demographic for this movie a vegetable patch?"
"263",4,"  Guillermo del toro's best picture film shows that love has no boundaries. A unique approach to such a film as the main character is mute. The film is beautifully crafted and keeps the audience on its toes as the ending brings the whole film full circle. The film has a dark and eerie overarching mood and theme similar to Guillermo's other film series ""Hell boy"". Some could even go as far as calling this film a prequel to ""Hell Boy"" as this could be a backstory for the ""hell boy"" character Abe Sapien. With the overall mixture of beatuy and darkness is a no brainer why this was nominated for an academy award."
"264",2,"  Why oh why did this movie won an Oscar?? There's nothing here we haven't seen before. It's a fairy tale with every characteristics of it. migh as well have been called The Beauty and The Beast."
"265",1,"  I'll save you 2 hours of your life. It's about a sexual relationship between a strange woman and a sea humanoid. Don't trust the BS rotten tomatoes reviews."
"266",3.5,"  It was like splash, the movie from 194 with tom hanks, but it's from a female perspective. I believe she was a fish too!"
"267",5,"  Great movie. Visually interesting."
"268",2,"  A Thin plot fulled with gimmics to get us to feel. The antagonist belongs in a 2 dimensional commic book, not a full length film. How did this film become ""best picture.""."
"269",5,"  ahhh the sixties!!! an hypocrite era made of apparences, cynic behaviours, bigotry, racism and false ideology...and part of this true horrible american background, a woman in her intricate simplicity and a lonely, superior creature, metaphor of mother nature, exploited, tortured, segregated by a bunch of useless, empty, frustrated characters. a movie manifesto of liberty, love, respect for the different, for the animals, for the environment, for the true emotions that represents the true virtues of a human being."
"270",3,"  Muito bonito, muito bem feito.....mas eu achei apenas ok."
"271",4,"  A bizarre but amazing story about silent love. Extraordinary music and art direction."
"272",0.5,"  watched it because it is the "" best movie,"" turned out to be a complete, utter waste of time,, not entertaining at all!!!"
"273",0.5,"  The only good acting in this was by Octavia Spencer. Otherwise, this was a real Hollywood wet dream--2 women, one Black and one Latin, a Jew, and a Homosexual all battling evil Caucasian men-one American Gestapo like character, his commanding officer, and 2 Russian spies to protect an oppressed God-like creature. Add this to the vast line up of Hollywood movies that injected over-the-top and old-timey Jim Crow racism to their themes and scripts this year-- in light of the Democrats labeling all conservatives as white racists. Hollywood in full swing with early brainwashing for votes."
"274",0.5,"  What did i just watch?"
"275",4.5,"  What a strange, wonderful romance! Great cast, too. Love this movie."
"276",1.5,"  Is it a good movie? Very Average Is it visually stunning? Yeah Did it deserve an Oscar for best movie? NOVery overrated and better movies out there that deserved best Oscar I-Tonya being one of them"
"277",3,"  Starts off very good and very unique. All the character's were well crafted. Some ideas in the story were a bit dumb, but you may not even care as you start to enjoy this movie. As the movie progresses, it dumbs up even more with a dance scene and romance that seems so out of place... To say the least."
"278",0.5,"  now were giving out oscars for having sex with animals?"
"279",1,"  I'm surprised at the accolades this has got. A fairly boring storyline; basically free Willy with a bit of romance thrown in."
"280",5,"  what is more to be said about this movie it is amazing in every aspect a Triumph of human love and surpasses everything emotionally and spiritually :-)"
"281",4.5,"  Imanginitive, funny, sumptuous, and surprisingly complex, Guillermo del Toro's latest stroke of genius is one of many that proves the filmmaker as the master of modern monster movies."
"282",0.5,"  Despite the incredible talent behind this film, it's a failure from start to finish. The inimitable Sally Hawkins is like a duck out of water and fails to bring this character to life. The visuals are recognisably those of Guillermo del Toro but the story telling is not. The story is pedestrian and predictable. Save yourself two hours and steer clear."
"283",4.5,"  Delightful film - the sense of time and place was very strong, as were the characters. The mix of thriller and fantasy was engaging and the storyline kept one guessing albeit that in the end the finale was predictable."
"284",4.5,"  I never really feel things in movies, especially romantic ones. But boy did I feel things in this movie, and it must've been a challenge making a fish such a romantic figure. Dancing scene is my favourite!"
"285",2,"  Pretty. Looks aside, its just weak. Too many micro subjects with characters we are rushed into knowing, and at best form weak attachments to. Like a Disney Date night movie."
"286",4.5,"  IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A ROLLERCOASTER PLOT HERE, KEEP LOOKING. THIS ISN'T A PLOT DRIVEN ENTERPRISE--THERE WILL NOT BE AN ENDING YOU COULDN'T SEE FROM A MILE AWAY (IF YOU WERE EVEN LOOKING FOR AN END FROM THE BEGINNING). IT'S NOT THE POINT, PEOPLE. THIS IS ABOUT ATMOSPHERE AND MOOD. THIS IS ABOUT MYTH AND MAGICAL REALISM, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND CHEMISTRY. IT'S A LOVE LETTER TO CINEMA, AN ESCAPE FROM REALITY VIA HUMANITY. I LOVED THIS FILM."
"287",4,"  7.8/10 Too much water"
"288",2.5,"  VISUALLY RICH AND OVERLY SIMPLISTIC IN IN IT'S RENDITION OF GOOD VS EVIL. NO SURPRISES. A CHILD-LIKE FAIRY TALE WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE BROTHER'S GRIMM."
"289",3.5,"  I think the best part for the film is the very nice picture you get. It makes you really feel like you are in the time period it is based on... story was SATISFYING enough to watch it all to the end."
"290",5,"  I am really happy that the main character was someone with a disability. I really liked how it was set in the 50's. and that it showed some of the fashion and so some of the cars of the decade. I thought it was very insightful to show that some of the ""relationships that were thought of as ""Normal"" relationships were far from perfect."
"291",5,"  One of the most interesting films in a very long time. Absolutely superb and different"
"292",0.5,"  MORE LIKE THE THE SHAPE OF A TURD!I'd give it less if I could. They took the great movie SPLASH, and made it suck. You have problems if you like this movie. All critics that praised this movie should be fired."
"293",5,"  Perfect movie. can't say there is anything wrong with it. best mermaid movie of all time. shannon kills his roll. sally hawkins kills her roll. everyone does a great job. spfx of course were also great. just awesome. great concept, great execution."
"294",2.5,"  Am I the only one who though I felt the story waas interesting it was anti military and police? The General and the head of security were evil, cruel and sexist. The only decent people were disabled, black and a Russian spy. Hollywood doing its best to change our views and make us believe America is bad."
"295",3,"  This movie was weird from beginning to end. It shows our government inhumanly treating a sea creature. The plot makes no sense. Sally Hawkins is fine as a mute but the incredible script or story is not salvigable."
"296",4.5,"  Beautiful reimagining of your classic love story"
"297",1,"  The most horrible oscar winnerS so far."
"298",3,"  A movie that, within a strage setting of events, makes us think about why we choose our companions in life"
"299",5,"  Art in all it's forms"
"300",3,"  Admittedly, this film was OCCASIONALLY uncomfortable and many of its aspects were forced. There was little room to decipher the characters for anything other than what they were obviously made out to be, and the negative stereotypes and issues of the era were so clearly thrown into the script just to show that RACISM, sexism, communism...etc. all existed and are bad. Yet, This movie told a familiar story, all while being unfamiliar all the same. Sally Hawkins DELIVERED a strong moral character of ambition and love through her LONELINESS. The movie provided subtle meaningful cues and addressed important concepts while maintaining its plot, and the visual production ended up as MESMERIZING. It was an interesting watch that understandably landed Del Toro in the Oscars, but not personally Best Picture or anything I'd watch again."
"301",4,"  ???? ?? ???????? ??? ???? ??? ?????!!"
"302",1,"  DEL TORO WORST MOVIE. I REALLY DON'T GET THE HYPE"
"303",1,"  Dull, overrated movie with one-dimentional characters"
"304",1,"  another film where the white males are evil. Big surprise"
"305",3.5,"  I saw this film two Times at the cinema because it is absolutly beutiful"
"306",3.5,"  So, this isn't a bad movie but after watching most of the other nominees I am struggling to see how this managed to get best picture. So, the acting is impeccable with Sally Hawkins beautifully bringing to life a woman who has felt isolated because of her condition. It's visually stunning and the story is enjoyable enough but there is nothing particularly strong and stellar in regards to its plot. And this perhaps for me is the let down; I cannot identify with the central love story that they have tried to create and the need to unnecessarily sexualise the relationship undermines it further. The film relies heavily on the idea of this revolutionary relationship to credit it with its original and outlandish thinking. Strip away this twist and there's not much here that hasn't been done before and to a better standard."
"307",5,"  Intelligent, unique, and revolutionary"
"308",1,"  How this movie won best picture is beyond me just not a good movie."
"309",2,"  I dunno, it just wasn't compelling at all. A lady falling in love with a fish? Really? The last time this idea showed up was the Bee Movie. Look how that turned out. Besides the stupidness and lack of connection, it does appear that they were at least trying to make a good movie, though."
"310",2,"  who is a target audience for this movie? it is Too primitive to keep an adult engaged through, while containing irrelevant sex and violance unsutable for children. Leaves an aftertaste of disappointment and tint of regret for waisted 2 hours of one's life"
"311",5,"  ""The Shape of water"", ES UNA NUEVA ENTREGA DE LA BRILLANTE MENTE DE GUILLERMO DEL TORO, QUIEN MERECIDAMENTE HA RECIBIDO PREMIOS DE LA ACADEMIA Y OTROS FESTIVALES POR SU DEDICACIN Y CUIDADO A LA HORA DE PRESENTAR SUS TRABAJOS VISUALES. ESTE FILM NO DECEPCIONA Y SE MANTIENE A LA ALTURA DE ""EL LABERINTO DEL FAUNO"", YA QUE AMBOS SON RELATADOS COMO UN POEMA, UNA PROSA FANTSTICA QUE COMBINA TANTO ELEMENTOS DE LA VIDA REAL (APROVECHANDO EN HACER CRTICA SOCIAL SOBRE DETERMINADOS TEMAS SOCIO-POLTICOS Y CULTURALES), COMO TAMBIN DE ESE PECULIAR BESTIARIO CON EL CUAL NOS DELEITA. SALLY HAWKINS DA UNA TIERNA Y SENTIDA INTERPRETACIN CON SU PERSONAJE, APROVECHANDO LAS BONDADES DEL LENGUAJE CORPORAL PARA HABLAR TANTO A LOS OTROS PERSONAJES COMO A LA AUDIENCIA. SI BIEN EL DESARROLLO DE LAS CONTRAPARTES DEL FILM PODRAN CATEGORIZARSE COMO UN POCO GENRICAS, NO SE DEBE PASAR POR ALTO EL CONTEXTO Y LAS CIRCUNSTANCIAS QUE SON TRADAS A LA LUZ, PARA SEGUIR TRATANDO TEMAS QUE AN HOY EN DA PERMANECEN. POR TODO ESTO, ""THE SHAPE OF WATER"" MERECE TODA LA ATENCIN DEL MUNDO."
"312",1,"  i did not like the movie. I wasn't able to buy into the conecpt, I thought she fell for this creature very quickly without any real development of relationship, she was able to communicate with him far too quickly also. And, I didn't appreciate the creature killing her cat, and then on top of that she had sex with him not long after. Awful."
"313",2.5,"  nothing special to see here in my opinion. very predictable. no surprises. feels like i've seen this story many times before. it's a decent watch although you're not missing much if you choose to pass on this one."
"314",4,"  It's basically the adult version of ""the Little Mermaid"", but set in the timeline of 1960's in the United States with the gender in opposition to the fairy tale.The love is raw and authentic. A film dedicated to those who believe in the power of love, and perhaps some interest in the fantasy genre"
"315",4.5,"  Well how do I start, I can not say too much about this film. At first glance, I did not knew what to expect (like in every del toro's film). I started watching the movie and I really felt that cinema love. I really really love del toro's art work. You got to love the scenarios and the shots, also The soundtrack is something you really got to enjoy in the movie. The story is something really new and I think some people would find it awkward in some point but if you see it in the point of view that its an original film story and something created out of guillermo del toro's imagination, you really find that special touch. i really hate that now days all the movies got the same story and plot twist so you will know what will happen. in this film its not like this. At least I, will never imagined the ending or the ""theories"" behind it. it really puts guillermo del toro in my top 10 best directors list. he never disappoints on what he does and I really think that this was a film well deserved of an oscar."
"316",0.5,"  Way too long. I for one don't see what the critics saw in this movie. It was quite boring, had a lot of plot holes and situations that made no logical sense. I reckon its just another example of the current hollywood writing/directing scene, ie lackluster and idealess. How its won any awards is beyond my understanding."
"317",2,"  Below average movie. Did not care for it to much"
"318",0.5,"  We watched 40 minutes of it and I am convinced that the PRO critics are really aholes in disguise..."
"319",5,"  Diomerda che FILMONe"
"320",0.5,"  It's a stinky fish of a movie. I can tell you why i think it so, but it would be wasted energy added to the two hours of life i've Lost to this travesty. How did 'Amelie' - which it seems to imitate - not win an Academy over this Tripe? Pun intended."
"321",5,"  Una pelicula excelente, historia, desarrollo y cierre, con unas actuaciones de primer nivel. sin dudas, fue la mejor produccion del ao pasado"
"322",2,"  OK movie at best. How this won best picture still had me baffled."
"323",2.5,"  BORING!! How this won best picture is beyond me."
"324",4,"  beautiful looking movie; however, i did not love the plot"
"325",5,"  The Shape of Water is one of those Hollywood movies that feels like it made with actual passion. Just like other Guillermo Del Toro movies, the makeup for this movie is phenomenal. This man is a master at making movies like Pan's Labyrinth. Sally Hawkins gives an incredible performance. In fact, everyone gives a strong performance, especially Doug Jones. The score created by Alexandre Desplat was incredible. The main thing I love about this movie is the idea of every human being incomplete. It is a theme that is present throughout the movie and I absolutely love it. I don't think The Shape of Water is better than Pan's Labyrinth, but it's pretty damn close."
"326",1.5,"  Recycled story inarticulately told behind a dripping but pretty veneer"
"327",5,"  Mesmerising, romantic, mystifying, thrilling. Its a 50s/60s Kind of homage to aquaman/scifi, and the dread threat america saw in the ussr, played out against a love story of individuals who 'dont fit in' to conentional mores of the time. Well worth seeing ????"
"328",4,"  Visually stunning, and with stellar performances from Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer, The Shape of Water is an interesting fantasy love story full of magic and music."
"329",3,"  Another wildly over-hyped oscar winner. It's OK, with a great PERFORMANCE from Sally Hawkins but a cardboard cut out baddie and a very slight plot. No idea why this is all in Caps."
"330",4,"  Strange. Cant be categorized. Or I cant, but enjoyable."
"331",4.5,"  Was ok. Great actors... Not my Cup of tea, but an yes an elite movie."
"332",0.5,"  DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE - it is porn draped in art. A total humilation of woman. Shame to Oscars. Rotten Tomatoes automatically gave It 4 stars even after I gave it half. Rotten reviews all round."
"333",1,"  The movie Succed,the building of the main CHARACTERS was weak. We dOn't know anything aboit her except she is deaf and was an orphen and apParently likes to fuck fIsh. The fisH was also nameless. It wAs oscar MATERIAL because she DID Not say a word and for nudity."
"334",3,"  The Shape of Water is a very well done film. The casting all the way down to the set design is flawless. However, the plot was not my cup of tea. It was a very basic heart warming romantic story with some nudity and chronic masturbation sprinkled in. The plot was very predictable and half way through the plot really slows down and begins to drag. Overall, this movie was the most artistic but not the most entertaining movie of the year."
"335",3.5,"  Del Toro's dark fairytale is beautifully shot with slow-tracking camera moves drawing us right in to the eyes - and the souls - of the characters. Hawkins is an excellent choice for such an intimate and expressive mute character but the rest of the casting felt very safe. Shannon, Stuhlbarg and Spencer -all actors I admire - are just doing what they've done countless time before. Coupled with the story feeling like countless other fairytales and I left feeling like I hadn't experienced or learnt anything new. It is certainly visually accomplished and for ""best picture"" it deserves its accolades. ""Best story"" or ""movie-going experience""? I'm not convinced."
"336",0.5,"  Take out the gay pushing agenda, the unnecessary sex, nudity and masturbation scenes, and the excessive profanity and it could've been a decent movie, instead liberal Hollyweird shoving their agenda DOwn oir throats. Couldn't even finish the movie..."
"337",3,"  beauty and the beast..again. wonderful acting. How it was chosen best movie is a mystery to me."
"338",2,"  THIS MOVIE WAS A BIG LET DOWN...WAY OVER HYPED...NO PLOT....AND THE ONLY REASON i GAVE IT TWO STARS IS BECAUSE THEY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB ON THE FISH GUYS CHARACTERS APPEARANCE"
"339",3.5,"  It's a good film with good messages, but not quite the movie of the year."
"340",3.5,"  It's definitely good and the craft behind it certainly has an eye, but it feels hollow in many ways, some good, some bad."
"341",1,"  IT was stupid that the creatu killed the cat."
"342",1.5,"  I'm A FAN OF GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S FILMS BUT NOT THIS ONE. sOME OF THE ACTORS AND CHARACTERS WERE EXCELLENT BUT WHOEVER COINED THE TERM 'GRINDING NEMO' SUMMED IT UP. aND FOR THE MANY REVIEWERS SAYING THIS IS A WONDERFUL HOMAGE TO THE MOVIES OF THE 1950S - i DON'T RECALL SEEING ANY FILMS FROM THAT TIME WITH SAY GRACE KELLY OR HUMPHREY BOGART MASTURBATING (WHICH THE MAIN CHARACTER HERE DOES TWICE IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES). tHIS WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER IF THEY HADN'T TRIED TO MAKE IT ROMANTIC. SOME EXCELLENT MOMENTS BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS PREDICTABLE AND NOT LIKEABLE. INTERESTING HOW IT'S HAD SO MANY GREAT CRITIC REVIEWS BUT AUDIENCES AREN'T SO KEEN."
"343",0.5,"  I don't ever want to see this horrifying piece of indulgence ever EVER again."
"344",1,"  Shameless rip-off of the 1962 Soviet film called ""The Amphibian Man"". But hey, it's way too old to even bother comparing the two, right?"
"345",1,"  I waited all the movie for some twist or a saving grace, but it did not come... The plot is like it was invented by a 12 yr old which was late to deliver an essay for the English class. The protagonist, the villain, everything is so schematic like the authors are making fun of their audience... Cheap exploit of the sympathy for the underdog."
"346",1,"  I WAITED ALL THE MOVIE FOR SOME TWIST OR A SAVING GRACE, BUT IT DID NOT COME... THE PLOT IS LIKE IT WAS INVENTED BY A 12 YR OLD WHICH WAS LATE TO DELIVER AN ESSAY FOR THE ENGLISH CLASS. THE PROTAGONIST, THE VILLAIN, EVERYTHING IS SO SCHEMATIC LIKE THE AUTHORS ARE MAKING FUN OF THEIR AUDIENCE... CHEAP EXPLOIT OF THE SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG."
"347",4,"  I mean, it's cute, but best picture worthy, nah."
"348",2,"  Wow. Hollywood has become so incredibly transparent. So after The Artist, this is the movie that we have to fall in love with now. Because it is set in the early 60's, so nostalgia. Because the characters watch old black and white movies in their retro tv sets, while talking about how wonderful they are, so meta-nostalgia. Because the movie theater, the signs, the cars, the clothes, the pies and the diner...because nostalgia.Honestly, the story seems forced. Some characters and their relationships seem forced and placed/written just to make a point. The sassy black woman who complains throughout the movie about her husband (one could say she's actually complaining about all husbands, on behalf of all women), and finally puts him down at the end as the spineless coward he is. The old man who is unnecessarily shown to be a homosexual just so we can feel bad for him when he makes a totally uncalled for advance on the man who works the diner, who is an obviously straight white dude, who, for a twofer, gets to have a random black couple walk into the diner just so he can be racist on top of homophobic. I'm not going to focus on the other ""good guy"" being an actual communist, because even though the whole Russians subplot felt unnecessary and a bit forced, I understood his character as a scientist with a conscience, which made me understand his actions beyond his political and patriotic allegiances. And I honestly don't believe there is any relevance to him being a communist good guy. It's more about him being a non-U.S. citizen good guy. Did you know russians can be good people too? now you know.Now on to the bad guy. I'm not going to remark on him being a heterosexual white male, because a person in his position, in that time, would invariably fit that description. It's the fact that he is cold, emotionless, detached, cruel, racist, arrogant, classist, sadistic, tortures animals, is probably misogynistic, and is a general ""meanie"". the only thing missing is if they had literally named him ""donald"". the character feels like the product of the worst fears of a group of radical liberals assembled in a safe space, for the purpose of symbolizing in one man everything they consider to be evil in today's world. The funny thing is how they attempt to make the character profound or interesting, by making him get philosophical about pissing/washing your hands, and teaching us, I mean, the protagonists, about biblical characters and the meaning of certain complex-sounding words. And the whole bit about the candy. I don't get it. I don't buy it.I'll admit I was impacted by the loneliness and detachment that the protagonist must have felt to have engaged in such a relationship with a non-human creature, and I actually had no issue with the sexual aspect of the relationship, because, love is love. This is undoubtedly the most extreme version possible of that message, but it was only the underlying theme of the main story, as opposed to feeling like a message disguised as a story/character. and yet, upon reflection, i can't agree with this either. their romance is incredibly forced and rushed, and she basically has sex with him just because he has a humanoid shape. consider the relationships we build with cats, dogs, or other pets. it never crosses our minds, no matter how lonely we get, to have sex with them, because they look like animals. this creature barely communicates with her, but she decides to have sex with it because it resembles a human and stands on two feet. she's basically fucking her dog, if the dog could stand on two feet and had longer legs and arms. Think about this: There are gorillas who can communicate with sign language. you can have entire conversations with them, hundreds of times more complex than the 2 things the creature ""says"" to her. The gorilla has the most humanoid shape of any animal. so, basically, if he could stand on two feet and look her in the eyes, you could replace the lab with a zoo, the creature with a gorilla who knows sign language, and she ends up, inevitably, fucking a gorilla.The scene that perfectly encapsulates why you will be told to love this movie, is the fantasy sequence where the mute girl starts singing beautifully, and then tap dances with the sea creature on a beautiful stage backed by a big band. All in black and white, of course. Because, nostalgia. even people who liked the movie find this scene laughable and forced.The end also comes out of nowhere, when the creature somehow turns her scar tissue into functional gills. This is the only moment, other than the intro, when the movie felt to me like a fairy tale story. The movie itself didn't feel to me like it was trying to emulate Beauty and The Beast or some other tale, rather it was just inspired by it and other similar tales. The story felt like it was doing its own thing (unlike something like Pacific Rim, for example, which is meant to be viewed as an anime), which makes the fairytale intro and ending feel out of place and forced. If you like Guillermo Del Toro, who I'm not too much of a fan of, other than of his visual imagination, check out any of his other stuff. If you liked Sally Hawkins' performance (which is not ""stellar"", or ""phenomenal""), you'll be much better off seeing her in Happy-Go-Lucky or Made In Dagenham. Or watch her in this too (she does a good job) and make up your own mind about the whole thing. Just don't let Hollywood awards shows and critics dictate what you should watch and much less what you should like and love. Remember The Artist. Remember The Last Jedi. Remember The Shape Of Water."
"349",3.5,"  partendo dal presupposto che l'oscar l'avrei dato a ""I, tonya"", film politicamente scorretto, cinico e divertentissimo di tale Craig Gillespie e nemmeno inserito in nomination da questi stronzoli di americani che non capiscono una sega. ""La forma dell'acqua""  un bel film, molto ben confezionato (impacchettato per gli oscar) direbbero i critici paganti, ma ""il labirinto del fauno"" rimane per il momento il vero capolavoro di guillermone one one. il grande Michael Shannon, un cattivo decisamente sfigato, andava nominato come miglior attore non protagonista. mezzo punto in pi per la scena con la ""gatta sul piatto che scotta""."
"350",3,"  As visually delightful as it is simple in narrative, the shape of water is poetry in motion. Filled with allegorical characters and motifs, the shape of water has more to it than meets the eye. having said that, I Believe that the shape of water relies a bit too much on the audience reading between the lines, appreciating its visual appeal and drooling over del toro's craftsmanship. the film looks great, flows well but there is nothing new to appreciate, in terms of content and aesthetics. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY UNI-DIMENSIONAL AND OTHER THAN SALLY HAWKINS, THERE IS NO PERFORMANCE THAT ONE CAN MAKE A SPECIAL MENTION OF. THE SHAPE OF WATER IS STRICTLY A GOOD ONE-TIME WATCH."
"351",4.5,"  ""The Shape Of Water"" is a fairytale for adults, featuring all the fantasy weirdness that we've come to expect by Del Toro. It also features tons of originality, amazing effects and visuals, plus all around great performances."
"352",4,"  Its an odd match with an absorbing story"
"353",4,"  the movie brings a social critic behind the acceptation of South american creature IN times of trump's wall. not judging if it deserved the best Picture award though, the story was weak but the metaphor is genious"
"354",5,"  The shape of water is a perfect blend of sci-fi and romance so elegant that even in an unforgiving society the universal power of love still flows through. This film is so perfect that both can be beautiful and neither has to be beastly in the pedestal of love."
"355",2.5,"  I definitely wasn't the target audience for this kind of movie. the best thing about this was octavia spencer's comicrelieve. also sallys performance was really powerfull but the rest i couldn't really connect with it."
"356",0.5,"  Another of Hollywood's ""originals"". For the ones with short memory that is. We've read it years ago in Alexander Belyaev's book The Amphibian Man. The movie is nothing short of approx. 2 hours of boredom and clichs."
"357",5,"  beautiful, just beautiful, it deserved best picture and the acting is just magnificient."
"358",1,"  It is shite! Terrible on all levels."
"359",3,"  Heavy handed and just weird. This may be del Toro's weakest effort since Cowboys and Aliens... which was actually more entertaining."
"360",1,"  The reason I give this movie a 1.5 stars is because the monster costume was cool, good actors. The story is so stupid, the main character shows nudity...who cares, she plays with herself in the tub.....who cares and what relevance is that. The main character puts a towel under the bathroom door to fill up the room with water, like this really happens. Then she is in the room filled water and swims with the creature. WHO CARES. I wasted my money and cant get back the 2 hrs of my life. Thumbs down!!!"
"361",1,"  Perverse and sick. What happen to sanity. Study history 13 civilations went down the same path of self destruction embracing a mind like this that destroys any moral compass. There is nothing new about this."
"362",3,"  Looks and sounds great but there's not much substance to it."
"363",1,"  I'm sorry but I just don't get it. The best description I've seen so far for this movie is ""soft core fish porn"" So, I'm sure many of you will simply say I'm shallow and not ""deep enough"" (yes it's my play on words) to understand this movie, but really?? It's just dumb."
"364",4,"  Pathetic lefty drivel. Save your money"
"365",0.5,"  This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen! It is bad at the beginning, in the middle and at the end! Acting, script and substance are totally missing!It was a complete waste of time watching it. Imagine, a woman making love to a FISH ?And Hollywood tells me this is one of their best? Joke is on us for paying to see it. Forget the hype and forget this movie."
"366",2,"  Not much here that was novel, engaging, awe inspiring or moving. Go see Sally Hawkins in Maudie if you want to see her best work in a truly great movie."
"367",3.5,"  The Shape of Water is no Abe Sapien prequel, well yes it is. Even though del Toro tried to distance it from the Hellboy connection it was. I enjoyed the film, even though it was a spin on Beauty and the Beast. Was actually hoping for a bit more of a fresh storyline, but got much of the formulaic storyline and expected results. Good rental for Blueray, not so much a theater must. Will still consider it part of the Hellboy world. Fits the DieselPunk Genre."
"368",1,"  If Racism could be made into motion art, then this movie deserves an Oscar. Amazing acting, except for the stereotypical bad guy. Reference that ""she"" was found by the river and already had dormant gills. The ""wetback"" from South American who does not belong. The balding white guy who repentantly has to step in to save the day, and the Russian who has the best of intentions... Everyone gets to live happily ever after... but only after the first generation wetback goes back to her own kind, the real wetback from SA, and they both leave the country... Oh, the the poor suffering housewife, who nobody cares about, and the dead white patriot who was doing his best to protect his country."
"369",0.5,"  This movie is a messy fish porn."
"370",2,"  No idea how the community of rotten tomatoes gave this movie such a high review considering how great this site usually is at determining how good a movie actually is. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen and there are some good things about it. The setting of the movie with the music are awesome. The characters are enjoyable but with all that being said the movie really drags on and is plagued with tons of awkward scenes that don't contributed to the movie in anyway. Tons of masturbation scenes just to show how lonely the main actress is. I guess to justify the sex scene she has with a fish man later, which is totally disgusting. You can't compare this to something like beauty and the beast. Anyone who says this is a great piece of art is delusional and look into things way to much to the point its borderline idiotic. It's the equivalent of finding some deep meaning to opening a can of spaghettios. If you choose to watch this movie, make sure not to do it around family because it is slow and extremely awkward."
"371",5,"  Story was a little predictable but the acting, directing, and visual look were all AMAZING"
"372",5,"  SPOILER I find it incredibly sad so many narrow minded people didn't either a. get the message of the movie, or b. were to engrossed stuffing popcorn in their traps they missed the critical information about WHY Elisa is attracted to the creature. She was found on a river bank in South America. She has scars on her neck that have been there since childhood. She controls the water on the window with her hand when riding the bus. The signals were all there for anyone who paid attention to the movie to see but most didn't. She was the same creature but she evolved differently. Even the doctor comments that the creature can breathe in and out of water. It wasn't a degree in physics needed to understand the film. It is not a liberal agenda film either. Gays and blacks had very little rights despite supposedly having them during this era. It was a time period in history where many of US citizens lived in fear of nuclear attack by Russia and bombing drills were held in school. The creature can sense what Elisa is but fears her slightly because she appears human. It is a beautiful tale of acceptance, love, and bravery by a woman the world sees as defective. The cinematography was stunning. The ethereal use of the blues and greens was just as stunning. Actually watch the movie and see the clues, and maybe those who hated it might actually see what I am talking about."
"373",5,"  This movie is a cruveball, never seen anything like it before. Story is similar to beautify and the beast but real, gritty and thought provoking. MUST SEE!"
"374",2.5,"  Boring with silly interspecies love."
"375",0.5,"  Pointless. I seldom walk out of a movie. Did this time."
"376",1.5,"  It's ET reimagined from the ultra liberal point of view. You now get to see Eliot jerking off in the tub & bangin ET in his closet!A rediculus story on so many levels.To be fair, the cinematography was really well done."
"377",2.5,"  This is basically Free Willy with a Merman instead of a whale. It's just about watchable."
"378",0.5,"  A leftist liberal Holywood propaganda where female has to be in a leading role. Her husband is a failure (lost hist job, can't sexually satisfy his wife, is a coward, can't cook etc). Other male figure potrays men as tirans. Who can save this courageous and empathic female from self-empowering masturbation? A transsexual fish! ""Progressive"" propaganda with some bestiality. What a joke!"
"379",0.5,"  Movie that promotes inter-species sex. There is a word for that. Might as well go to a donkey show. Next year they will make a film about Catherine the Great and her horse, it too will receive critical acclaim."
"380",0.5,"  Third class picture. Unnecessarily disgusting and poorly made with a cliche story line and screen play."
"381",0.5,"  There were so many ways this film could have been amazing, and it stopped short at every turn. The character development was lazy and it felt like the powerful acting was overpowered by the unnecessary sexual scenes. I'm sorry I even went to see this movie."
"382",5,"  I watched this movie and I loved it. It was a beautiful romantic love story. I see how some can call it a remake of ""Splash"" but that was a children's story this is a full on adult fairy tale with depth and drama. This is ""Beauty and the Beast"" imagined in a whole new wonderful way. The best movie I've seen in a long while."
"383",3.5,"  The 'little' person is often the smartest. A very Hollywood film from the talented Mexican director."
"384",3,"  The Shape of Water is a very creative and stunningly visual and sounding film, but with an underwhelming story and slower pace. Sally Hawkins' Elisa is mute and communicates through sign language. She lives a boring life as a janitor for a secret government laboratory, with the only the only people close to her being a woman named Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins). The leader of the facility, Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) captures a creature in South America and houses it in his facility. Elisa slowly develops a strong bond with this creature, who is actually very intelligent and able to understand human language and emotions. The film focuses on this relationship, which is a very weird concept between a mute woman and a creature from far away. The plot is also very predictable too once audiences figure out the premise, have seen the trailer, or heard anything about the film. The pacing can also be a bit slow at times, as not much occurs in the way of meaningful events for long durations of the film. There are many positives to the film however. The story is very creative unlike many modern Hollywood films. The movie is also visually stunning and the music and sound mixing is well done. 1960's America is captured perfectly and there are some great songs that add to the emotion of certain scenes. There are also standout performances from all of the actors and actresses, who are deservingly being considered for numerous awards. Overall, The Shape of Water is a creative, well acted, and visually stunning film, but it overshadowed by a simple and predictable premise and long duration of slow pace scenes."
"385",0.5,"  F*ck this movie. It should never have won Best Picture. The real movie that should've won was Get Out. I mean seriously, some drugged woman falls in love with an amphibian or what ever that thing is. While Get Out had a message that racism is still around today and we need to do something about it. The Shape of Water is like a big this is what happens when you get stoned and dream of when you go into a coma. I didn't like this film."
"386",1,"  *** ""CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON"" + ""SPLASH"" = ""BOOTY CALL AND THE BEAST"" ***"
"387",2,"  The film looked great, other than that its really weak, completely overhyped and definitely not the best work from Del Toro"
"388",4.5,"  In what is hands down Guillermo Del Toro's best film since ""Pans Labyrinth"", ""The Shape of Water"" shows Del Toro is best when working with a smaller budget. With the budget coming in at 20 million, I was amazed by how much they were able to accomplish with this film and how the movie never looks cheap. Shot by cinematographer Dan Lausten, the movie is beautiful to look at. Whether it be in the water or in a hotel room the movie looks gorgeous. The performances from Sally Hawkins and the supporting cast was fantastic. Playing a mute woman, Hawkins has to convincingly rely on facial expressions throughout the film. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are great and Michael Shannon plays a fantastic villain.The only problem I had with this movie was some parts of the relationship between Sally Hawkins and the sea creature. I found that the relationship was somewhat underwritten and rushed along. They maybe could have added a couple of extra scenes to flesh out their connection.Overall, we got a beautiful film that will rank as one of Guillermo Del Toro's best films to date.Final Score: 4.5/5 or 9 out of 10"
"389",5,"  Images that are impossible to forget."
"390",4.5,"  Solid movie all around with a great story...there were a couple of points I have questions about, but don't want to spoil anything."
"391",0.5,"  I would have walked out if I didn't value my effort to earn a dollar - which this movie doesn't deserve. Watch ""Splash"" and Creature from the Black Lagoon."" and you're seeing the same movie - ONLY they are both much better films."
"392",4.5,"  Looks to be a great film"
"393",1,"  Somehow this movie is both incredibly simple and childish while also being gruesome and graphically sexual. The entire plot is obvious from the movie poster, and the gratuitous sexual scenes take away more than they help the main story.Admittedly there is a high level of discipline demonstrated in creating a consistent aesthetic in the production, but outside of that almost black and white old time-y vibe, I almost found nothing in this movie enjoyable. The amphibian man is far too simple to care strongly for, the protagonist is so relentlessly driven and fearless that she comes off as childish. The main supporting role of her friend is fairly likable, but everyone else is at best a mixed case. The script is at times laughable, which I guess is the one clearly redeeming quality."
"394",2,"  I have no problem with inter-racial, homosexual, lesbian or trans-sexual relationships. But fish? I can't go there. I found the whole premise something of a joke... which is too bad because the production was top notch. It's the concept I just couldn't get past."
"395",5,"  poss the best film ive ever seen - a love story -a thriller- a fantasy - wonderful performances character studies-sally hawkins is a revelation and i fell in love with  her and the sea creature's wonderful relationship. and beautiful soundtrack/ music-TOTALLY MAGICAL. WONDERFUL FILM. you ,must have a cold heart not to fall in love with this film. when i saw it the whole audience loved it so much they stayed till the end of the credits with the song 'you'll never know' magic till the end GO SEE!"
"396",4,"  If you're not sure what The Shape of Water is about by just watching the trailer, and if you're confused because water doesn't have a shape when it comes down to it, you're not the only one. Basically, it is an R-rated girlish dream love story about a mute janitor who falls in love with a mutant fish-man.It is a fairy tale like The Little Mermaid except the roles are reversed. The man of the water meets the woman of the land. It is the ultimate fish out of water tale because to keep him alive she must logically, keep him in a bathtub. Ironically, this film is also a great resource for how to keep a fish alive in a tub for over a week.This very magical film becomes interesting when the character who we will affectionately call ""Fish-Jesus"" performs an act of God, healing a bald man of male pattern baldness by simply touching the top of his head. Insta-hair. This was hilarious!The Shape of Water is a film that I see could be part of a Shark Week special titled 'Sleeping With Sharks' on the next Shark Week. It is a romance we have not yet seen on the big screen. A love story that Director Guilermo Del Toro says was inspired by the 1960s character Gill-man from the film Creature from the Black Lagoon. Some may say she ""goes overboard"", or ""went off the deep end"" when she falls in love with the fish-man.Spoiler: There is a scene where water starts falling from the ceiling of the Theatre which I will not spoil but because of this film, the next time I am in the theatre and a water drops fall from the ceiling I am going to think twice. ""Tut tut it looks like rain."" -In the words of the animated iconic character Pooh Bear. But very positively for The Shape of Water, the award nominations are raining down. The film leads all films with 13 Oscar Nominations."
"397",0.5,"  I find this rating hard to believe! Hated it!"
"398",3,"  Another grossly overrated, ridiculous, predictable and rather boring film. If I could get my money back I would but more importantly I mourn the loss of my time."
"399",0.5,"  Awful. Preachy, leftist propaganda. No room for independent thought. Hated it so much they'll probably send me to the gulag. Stereotypical characters and cringey love story."
"400",4,"  It might be a story you've seen before, but The Shape of Water is still a very well-made movie that has great direction from Guillermo del Toro and really good performances from Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon."
"401",5,"  bravo Guillermo del Toro, I hope you win Best Picture tonight at the Oscars. The colours, the story, the cinematography. It's divine perfection. It brought to mind, Amelie - the movie was red and this is green. But that fantasy world is magical"
"402",5,"  By far the best of the Best Pictures. Gorgeous film, and the best since Moonlight."
"403",5,"  WOW! Visual poetry. The Shape of Water is a perfect example of masterclass filmmaking."
"404",0.5,"  Literally one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. Sally hawkins was wonderful the story aside fromBeing stolen is god awful."
"405",3,"  Strange movie, very artisty"
"406",2,"  64 years of watching movies under my belt and I still cannot understand when such a bad movie gets such great reviews. I could have stayed home warm in my bed watching MASH reruns with David Ogden Stiers and had a much more enjoyable evening. A waste of time."
"407",0.5,"  Horrible movie. Tons of nudity and female masturbation to keep a shallow audience interested."
"408",1.5,"  I honestly don't get the praise for this movie. The basic logic of this movie is completely unbelievable and down right dumb. Now I'm very cool with weird fantasy movies and honestly a maybe fish girl falling for a fishy, amazonian river god doesn't bother me. What bothers me is ever other dumb aspect of this movies story. The main plot focuses on how the U.S. want to study and disect the creature because it some how will give them an edge in the space race. That premise is flimsy at best as its never really explained why fish guy is important other than he can breath for a while outside of water. How that translates to traveling in space is beyond me, but thats the main plot. So the story focuses on a mute maid, who works at a top secret facility with the worlds worst security. The main bad guy gets two of his fingers bitten off early in the film, but the maids are apparently allowed to work alone in the room with the creature, so long as they only spend twenty minutes in there. The mute girl manages to form a relationship with fish guy and smuggles eggs and a fuckin record player in to the room where she loudly plays music and dances and nobody notices except the secret russian spy. Come on! They dont even put a cover on the damn things tank, thats a basic requirement for a home fish tank, let alone a creature that just bit a guys fingers off. And then of course there is the russians who want to kill the creature, so americans cant use it to win the space race (it justs so fucking stupid). Also our mute maid girl is an orphan found on a river bank in mexico and has weird scars on her neck which surprise, surprise turn into gills at the end of the film. The movie is in general just an uneven mess, much of the plot doesn't really matter and the characters are constantly questioning why their life sucks and they feel out of place. And hey, I get that the message of the movie is about feeling out of place and unloved, but the characters don't go anywhere, or evolve. Mute girl spends the movie in a constant child like fog where she eventually bangs a fish guy. Her gay artist friend is a failed artist, looking for love in all the wrong places and is the same guy at the beginning of the movie that he is at the end. Mute girls maid friend, just complains about being in a unloving relationship and just seems to be there as mute girls stereotypical black Jimminy Cricket friend. This movie simply does not deserve an oscar nomination."
"409",5,"  M-F-O8.9[C][Guillermo del Toro]"
"410",2,"  Really? Really? This got nominations for the Oscars or the razzies?Why make such a visually beautiful film with a stunning performance from Sally Hawkins only to ruin it with such a thin, patronising script with more plot holes my grans doily."
"411",1,"  Omg and wtf how does this crap end up being nominated for best pic?"
"412",1,"  One of the dumbest, most pointless movies I ever watched."
"413",0.5,"  Heavily sentimental and anodyne."
"414",3.5,"  While the set-up, production design, acting and directing is flawless I found myself a tad underwhelmed by the film after so much praise. It's the story. Once you heard the premise you can pretty much figure out the entire plot. That's a little disappointing for such an unusual and ambitious project. A lot of Del Toro's quirky trademarks are there, but it's a surprisingly mainstream film, if bestiality doesn't bother you."
"415",4.5,"  ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, for You are everywhere"" It is this beautiful poem which graces director, Guillermo del Toro's (Pan's Labyrinth) latest film, The Shape of Water. an outing that has been praised by critics and viewers alike, including 13 nominations at the Academy Awards. I watched this movie a day before the awards themselves, curious to see whether the ecstasy surrounding this film was deserved. Del Toro is a director whose work I occasionally struggle to enjoy and sometimes even understand, his work often being somewhat surreal and unusual to say the least. But, I was wrong to doubt. The Shape of Water is a mesmerising film, unique and stunningly executed. The story tells of the touching romance between cleaner, Elisa and an aquatic creature captured in the lab she works in. Helped by her isolated neighbour, Giles (played with lovely humanity by Richard Jenkins) and co-worker Zelda (portrayed, if slightly safely, by Octavia Spencer), Elisa attempts to help rescue her lover, against the threatening backdrop of a Cold War- espionage scheme.The film plays nice homage to movies of the 1950s, the time in which it is set; production design and visual style really emanate the Frankensteins and Flash Gordons of this time period very nicely, whilst all giving a new level of elegance and charm making SOW, visually, a treat. The direction is clever and succinct by Del Toro, with subtle references to social-historical context that interweaves and compliments the narrative. Del Toro is a seasoned veteran and it is easy to see why.Sally Hawkins is fantastic as the mute Elisa, performing almost entirely through sign language yet still conveying a real sense of emotion and believability. Doug Jones also portrays real humanity as the Creature; it is a compliment to these two actors that the romance between Elisa and the Creature is not only believable but beautiful too. Michael Shannon is suitably terrifying as Streckland, ambitious and longing to have the Creature in his grasp. Whilst Streckland's turn from racist scumbag to complete psychopath seems a little unbelievable (all it took was two fingers), Shannon's performance is fantastic, as is Michael Stuhlbarg, playing a Cold War spy with conviction.Accompanying the movie is Alexandre Desplat's mystical score, which is perfectly compatible with the feel of the film, as is the film's whole design, which is minimalistic, yet exquisite.Perhaps the greatest part of The Shape of Water however is its profound message of inclusivity and acceptance. Elisa and the Creature find love with one another as incomplete and isolated beings which accept eachother as they are and do not try to change eachother. Jenkin's Giles remains isolated from all but Elisa, due to the homosexuality he attempts to closet and Spencer's Zelda faces an unhappy marriage and racist snipes in her workplace. Through the film, we come to understand and empathise with these characters and through it we can understand the truly important message Del Toro is presenting; one of acceptance, respect and love.Overall, The Shape of Water is one of the finest films of 2017; crisply directed, heart-breaking yet witty, and visually breathtaking, here stands a picture well deserving of its acclaim, holding an important and timeless message."
"416",0.5,"  Absolutely terrible film, I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. Nothing remotely intelligent or well crafted about the while thing."
"417",4,"  Rating: A-Guillermo del Toro proves that his visuals are as impeccable as ever. Such a beautifully directed film, with so much vivid colors and wonderful production design. The editing is flawless, the score is magical and the cinematography is incredibly gorgeous.Sally Hawkins (Elisa Esposito) has a phenomenal performance. She is able to transmit her feelings in such a classy way and without saying a single word throughout the entire movie. Oscar-worthy display as well as the rest of the fantastic cast. Michael Shannon (Strickland) and Octavia Spencer (Zelda) are great, but Richard Jenkins (Giles) is right up there with Sally. An all-star cast delivers perfect performances that carry a meaningful, romantic and unique story.Unfortunately, not everything is perfect. The tone and the pacing are a bit unbalanced, but my main issue is the cheesy and predictable third act. Even though the story alone justifies watching this film, some people might find creepy the relationship between Elisa and the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones).Still, it is a brilliant screenplay with a lot of important messages and del Toro does an outstanding job directing The Shape of Water, which will surely get him a win at the 90th Academy Awards. It does not do enough for entering my Top10: Best Movies of 2017, but it gets a well-deserved Honorable Mention."
"418",4,"  ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, For You are everywhere.""It might not be as magical as Pan's Labyrinth but it certainly has the soul of the former. Its a love story, a fairy tale, a healing tale for the troubled times.One of my favorites of 2017. Oscar for probably Best Original Score and Director."
"419",3,"  While the cinematography was absolutely beautiful, I found the movie to be boring. I knew what to expect (i.e., that this was a fantasy story), but I could not emotionally engage with the characters at all. I was checking the time throughout the entire movie and was definitely happy when it ended. The film should definitely receive an award for cinematography, but if this wins best picture, I will be extremely disappointed."
"420",4,"  Visually stunning and distinct, it feels like a fairy tale shoved into the cold war era. Sally Hawkins delivers a brilliant performance as a mute character while the legendary Doug Jones makes a fish man real."
"421",0.5,"  A movie that picks up as a neo-Beauty and the Beast theme, it delivers a nice musical score and artistic merit. For that it fails in content, however, and screenplay, not shy to overview too much the main character's morning self pleasure scene and, not the least, bestiality scenes. How did this movie make it to the Academy for ? It is a profound mistery- the same way as Moonlight inexplicably won. Perhaps the Academy is under pressure to reward movies depicting minorities or an anti-state theme, such as this one."
"422",5,"  How very romantic and perfect. M Shannon pretty good as a character. Olivia Spencer as usual very funny with her talk and language of her face hmmm...Miss cheeky way"
"423",3,"  Too well crafted that sometimes it feels like it is emotionally mechanic."
"424",5,"  The fish was hot af. also good ost"
"425",4,"  ????????? , ?????????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?? ???????. ?????? ????? ????????????? ?? ???????? ????? ?????? ???????? ????? ????? ?????."
"426",3,"  In my opinion the film is overrated: the ET story this time narrated for adults with unnecessary violent scenes type Tarantino."
"427",5,"  This is beauty and the beast & Pans Labyrinth?s love child!"
"428",1,"  The Shape of Water essentially stole some of the look&feel from Amelie and turned it into a horrifically ridiculous movie with no interesting story line or plot containing flat one-dimensional characters who I could not understand or care for, it was utterly boring and predictable until the end without any depth or message. By the end I was ready to jump into the same river to drown myself."
"429",5,"  What is there to say about this movie hasn't been said already so worth seeing and such beautifully directed. His best work yet."
"430",5,"  The Shape of Water was a delightfully surprising movie that showcased, not only disabled characters but queer characters and people of colour beautifully. It brought forth the need to be accepted for who you are, eve if that is only by one person, and that love really knows no bounds. This is a movie I would see again in a heart beat!"
"431",2,"  I was really wanting to like this movie. The sex scenes were not necessary. The cinematography was excellent; most of the scenes were at night or underground & had a bluish tint. The storyline had holes even after forgetting the sex scenes. The doctor knows he is going to die: why does he give up the ladies. The healing power thing. I don't care how hungry you are don't eat cats. For me, The Shape of Water does not hold water."
"432",0.5,"  The most disturbing, weird and shitty movie I've ever seen. Whoever wrote it must have been on crack or something."
"433",0.5,"  Twilight is a better love story than this. Hollywood really needs to step up their game."
"434",0.5,"  Can not believe this movie would ever be considered for an Academy Award. Lousy movie!!!"
"435",1,"  This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. There is nothing artsy or remotely good about it. You quite literally have to have an extraordinarily low IQ to sit through that and think it all resembles anything worthy of acclaim. Utterly terrible!"
"436",3,"  Michael Shannon is a great villain, and del Toro directed well with his typical style. I was just not impressed by what is not a very original story. It's pretty much Free Willy, turned into a love story with the creature from the black lagoon. I liked it, but it is over-rated in my opinion."
"437",0.5,"  Terrible, it was predictable and boring . I do not understand what the fuss is about."
"438",5,"  Stunning to watch. Mesmerizing scenery and backdrops play masterfully with the hauntingly gorgeous performance of Sally Hawkins."
"439",4.5,"  If this is not the 2017 Best Picture winner at the Oscars then I don't know what. Del Toro, writer and director, chooses to keep his leads silent, thereby broadening their appeal in this story about loneliness and separation, and the joy of discovering that that is not exactly so. Like lasagna, there are many levels to this, kudos to cinema, music, dance, photography, to humanity, to love ... it is a tour de force of a work, meant to be experienced more than simply just once. And Hawkins is a revelation."
"440",4.5,"  Visual poetry. The Shape of Water is a perfect example of masterclass filmmaking."
"441",3.5,"  The Shape of Water is undeniably unique. The production design, cinematography, visual effects and score make you feel like you're in another world. The story, however, feels a little watered down. It takes an interesting concept and stretches it a little too thin, while patting itself on the back for being so artistic. I really enjoyed watching Sally Hawkins' and Doug Jones' performances, but this isn't Guillermo del Toro's best work."
"442",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is a wonderful modern fairy tale where the technical aspects are the highlights: the use of lighting in recreating the mood of the protagonist is superb, the film looks splendid and visually arresting, the score is understated but very pleasing, the pacing is excellent and del Toro's direction is reliably great. The acting is terrific across the board with the highlights being Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer and Sally Hawkins. It is not a fantastic film as it is undone by its excessive, distracting and entirely unnecessary gore and violence plus it needed more romance in it. The second half is more straightforward and predictable, but the first half is almost flawless. It is in the end a flawed, but still excellent film which is consistently involving to watch and populated by highly likable, wonderful characters."
"443",5,"  This is fantasy storytelling at its best, always balanced and well designed. The direction and production are flawless and precise; it reminds me of the best films by Stanley Kubrick in its approach and craftsmanship. The design of the film is very well planned, the gloomy, dark blue green atmosphere with retro mechanical devises and furniture combined and of course together with the creature give that special Del Toro feeling that now is so characteristic of his films like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" ""Crimson Peak"" ""Hellboy"" ""The Devils Backbone"" and many others both as director and writer.I suppose the creature is the same from the film ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" from 1954 who as far as I know, was also misunderstood and mistreated, this is not strange Del Toro is surely a fan of old monster and adventure films from the past. What is really extraordinary with his films is that all these ""creatures"" or ""monsters"" have a human dimension and breathe in the realm of empathy just as other normal human being would, so this creature has a special quality that is very related to humans but at the same time, there is no way out: it is a beast, ambivalence which creates an interesting situation, similar to the one in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with unknown consequences for the characters involved. So it's not necessary with so much explanation for where is this creature from or how was it taken, only a few short words that it is coming from the swamps of the jungle somewhere in the far south.Del Toro goes even farther out than Mary Shelley with the feelings of his monster as he makes him almost human in some aspects, special when it comes to his libido where together with his innate empathy for other beings that are nice with him, can express it wonderfully. And I must say that all the actors make a very good job, each with a very distinctive personality, the cruel torturist, the well-intended, the helpful, the leader, even the homosexual is represented and acting extremely well. All in all I must say I enjoyed this film and popcorn was very well spent. Highly recommended."
"444",3.5,"  A modern fairy tale. While the plot takes a few leaps of logic, the performances , the visuals, and the overall direction by Guillermo del Toro make for entertaining cinematic viewing."
"445",4,"  Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece is a contorted romantic journey in the (in)human condition, Its extremely engaging, stunningly cute, harsh, musical, violent and breathtaking. He is and always been a very particular in storytelling, Pan's labyrinth & Crimson Peak[1] are the perfect example of it.Movie plot took place around 1960 - a cold war era. Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a mute character, works as cleaning woman in an underground facility where scientific experiments took place. The place is run by General Hoyt and his security team. Story revolved around Elisa's daily life who has a co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer ) and a gay-neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins) to express her muteness. Story took a turn when Hawkins falls in love with a Gilled Amphibian Monster(Doug Jones) captured by a greedy human monster Richard (Michael Shannon). Bond gets stronger between Elisa and Amphibian man. Occam facility's decision to use amazon god for a cruel experiments left no choice to Hawkins but to stage an escape plan with whatsoever resources she has so far.Yet, No brief synopsis can fully convey the projection of Del Toro's beautiful imagination, Its treat which is to just feel rather than watch.Elisa's character is so powerful, a quietness with curious and observational eyes add more power to her character, she has literally used every muscle to express her emotions. An Opening scenes established Elisa's character with the great details. Bathtub scene with a timer portrait her loneliness and sexual enthusiasm due to that, Tearing calendar pages shows purposeless routine life, Early scenes with Giles portrait her as Dreamy Princess. Number of scenes like expressing her first meeting with creature to Giles or convincing for the rescue attempt of creature to Giles, creature's first touch at Bathtub are beautifully performed with intense emotions, she definitely delivered an performance that come along rarely in an artist's life.That scene between her and Giles when she asks Giles to help in the escape plan is the best scene of the movie, best enough to get the nomination for best actress.Movie concept is really ordinary, certainly a risky concept for a director like Del Toro but as movie proceeds, you'll feel that its Del Toro through and through. Combination of Hawkin's quietness, amphibious inhuman, Shannnon's powerful and monstrous character built a perfect fairy tale. Story telling with the great details is the gem of the movie. Cadillac showroom scene was somehow irritant to the plot but it was the perfect example of portraying Shannon's power. Green tone is nicely synced in all the scenes to create 60s effect. The art direction of the climax is extraordinary.The Shape of water is stunningly beautiful. Just go with it and get the best dive you'll ever had."
"446",0.5,"  FUGG-A-FISH had too many bubbles in its plot, its story line did not hold water; and overall was a pile of crap... Or, better stated: A POOL of CARP."
"447",0.5,"  Such a boring movie, I could watch only 40 minutes, so naive and predictable. It is a true wonder how the critics are accepting the movie. One of the worst of 2017, sorry."
"448",3.5,"  I didn't think I would like a movie about bestiality with an aquatic animal this much outside of a Troy McClure biopic...but here we are, and if you would have told me to pick which Best Picture nominee featured the most masturbation scenes and finger trauma I would have put ""Call Me By Your Name"" as a heavy -2500 favorite...but here we are. Fish love, egg timers and gangrenous appendages aside, this was a really good movie and although not my favorite of the year I wouldn't be mad at all if it won the Oscar."
"449",3.5,"  not as good as Toro's previous works as it lack the distinctive elements of horror, mystery. Otherwise its a definitely watchable film."
"450",5,"  Simplemente hermosa."
"451",5,"  I lved this flick. I've lays loved the tale of the maiden rescuing the knight. Here we have it very well told with an excellent sociopath of a bad guy. I loved that it was set In the early 60's during the Cold War. Before there was any success In combating racism or homophobia or zemophobia."
"452",0.5,"  You're kidding right? Welcome to Hollywood Bestiality. Coming up next..a man in a wheelchair falls in love with pony and the sex scenes are NOT underwater!"
"453",5,"  So beautiful, imaginative, and honest in its perfection of those at the margins. The script: folklore dancing with Americana peppered with the brutality of prejudice. Wow, just wow. I had not read any reviews of The Shape of Water but had seen one trailer. Now, I want to see it again."
"454",0.5,"  Otra pelicula sobrevalorada como La La Land. Podra estar bien filmada, no lo niego, pero la historia es lenta y sosa, con escenas de desnudo y sexo gratuitas e injustificadas que no aportan a la historia, la criatura con poderes curativos y mgicos (hacia falta?) y, entre otras cosas, un final bien a lo Disney. Con otro final hubiera sido, por lo menos para empezar a cambiar algo, mucho mejor. Pero no, habia que hacer uno para que la gente salga feliz y de que el amor existe y que todo lo puede, por sobre todo si es entre un humano y un reptil. La bella y La Bestia es un poroto..."

"456",1.5,"  Hirve skeidaa ja suuri pettymys. Katsokaa ennemmin Three Bilboards Outside Ebbing toistamiseen. Tmn elokuvan lopussa toivoin, ett kaikki hahmot kuolisivat. Spoiler: ei kuole."
"457",4,"  En plus d'une trs belle prestation de l'actrice Sally Hawkins, The Shape of Water est probablement l'une des plus belles ralisation de Guillermo Del Toro et parvient en mme temps  rendre hommage de faon assez originale aux classiques du cinma"
"458",4,"  A surprisingly good movie! Couched amongst the standard Hollywood Cold War cliches is an off beat science fiction love story between a woman and a fishman. Impressively, it actually works very well."
"459",4,"  My wife loved it. I thought the relationship was rushed. But a beautifully shot fantasy nonetheless."
"460",4,"  I knew I'd love this movie because I'm a sucker for unconventional love stories and I'm already in love with the creature. Such an amazing story with great acting."
"461",5,"  The Shape of Water (2017) was an absolute delight. It was a perfect adult fairy tale and not what I was expecting at all. It has an otherworldly feel to it, great soundtrack, amazing story, and suitable effects. Wasn't expecting a Cold War period drama but it's that too! A+ movie"
"462",5,"  Del Toro really drives the notion of: if you ever felt you were from another time and place, but having to live with the reality of this is where I am right now. The period the movie's set in matches the mood of the story - grim with a bit of hope. Shannon's instant karma is somewhat funny and tragic. I feel sorry for him...almost. Great acting by all! Beautiful set design and the amphibian man's costume is flawless."
"463",1.5,"  Strong acting, but a terrible plot. Dull, slow moving, and not very thought inspiring. Scenes have a tendency to drag with very little progression. After enjoying Pan's Labrynth immensely, I expected to be delighted with this movie, but was completely underwhelmed."
"464",0.5,"  No need for sexual content or nudity. The point was clear without that nonsense."
"465",2,"  With all the Oscar talk and plagiarism controversy swirling around it, I don't know what I really expected out of this flick... It has Guillermo del Toro written all over it, undoubtedly, with a surreal atmosphere like a combination of ""Hell Boy"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" as well as a strong ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" vibe.By the way, the Universal Studios ""Creature"" trilogy of the 1950s is one of del Toro's favorite monster treatments, and it's one that he wanted to remake in his own style, but Universal rejected his repeated proposals for years.This movie, however, doesn't really adhere to the aforementioned influences; rather, it enters the realm of Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" with the same simplistic storyline: An intelligent (even ""magical"") monster is brought into a dreamy caricature of ""modern"" mid-20th Century civilization, where it manages to make both loving friends and brutal enemies and eventually escapes back to its remote origins once more.Yes, there is the much-touted love interest between the monster and a human female; but this is no more derivative than ""The Creature"" was derivative of ""King Kong"" or a dozen other films in which the monster falls for the girl. That's just a time-worn Hollywood trope.I suppose I expected to see the elements that made ""The Shape of Water"" worthy of an Academy Award nomination...and I came away disappointed, because I just don't see it as Oscar-worthy.Production-wise, ""Shape of Water"" is only so-so: the story is a Hollywood standard; the sets are colorful but not especially innovative; the great majority of the monster effects are just latex; the musical score is not particularly memorable; and the acting is only adequate.Then there are the numerous stereotypes: the black and latino ""cleaning ladies"" who become ""empowered""; the bible-thumping white ""big boss man"" who sadistically bullies and tortures and shoots anyone that crosses his path; the ""devious Russians"" carrying out covert operations; and, of course, the ""lonely homosexual"" who has been alienated all his life by 20th Century Western society.Please, Guillermo. A 21st-Century ""social justice"" monster movie? Sheesh.These stereotypes are politically-correct cardboard cut-outs (unlike the characters in most del Toro films), which left me thinking that del Toro didn't work his usual magic on this one.So, no. No Oscar vote here."
"466",3,"  What's all the praise for on this one. Good love story but you can play it all out before it happens."
"467",4.5,"  Del Toro at his best since Pan's Labyrinth, with a story beautifully portrayed by a stellar cast and powerfully led by Sally Hawkins as a strong and unique heroine paired with Doug Jones at his best performance yet. A uniquely beautiful, and thrilling tale of love, The Shape of Water is not a film to be missed."
"468",1,"  The Shape of Cliche. Can't believe this totally predictable, schmaltzy rehash of twenty other movies got high audience reviews. The entire thing felt like it was thrown together in a week from a grab bag of cliches--not an original idea in it. And after you think the saccharine can't be piled on any higher in this long, drawn out mess, we get a POEM at the end--the narrator just can't shut up. All I can say is I guess most of the viewers didn't see the twenty other movies this one stole from. Maybe this could work for children, but sex with a reptile? I don't think so. Hollywood, get a grip, you have lost all touch with reality."
"469",3,"  I was a bit disappointed by this film. Admittedly my expectations were high going into it. The premise is magnificent and the trailer got me so excited to see what looked like a wonderful mix of Amelie's charm with Pan's Labyrinth's visuals and ultimately that is exactly what this film is, no less but nothing more either. The highlights were in the performances across the board and also the creature design. Overall it was an enjoyable watch but pretty much exactly what you might expect."
"470",5,"  Guillermo at his dark romantic best, shape of water is so much more than what you think. Like most toro films, the darkness of the characters and bleak story makes you feel like a horror film almost at first, but what seems so dark turns so romantic. Strong acting work from Shannon (extremely dark character) and a game stopping turn from Sally Hawkins, shape of water will leave you breahless"
"471",4.5,"  Ferociously unique, deliciously romantic, an ode to humble generosity and improbable love as well as an uncontrollable hate cry against big brother. Charming! Gripping! Horrifying! What else do you want?"
"472",5,"  Absolutely Beautiful - I love this movie - every minute is a delight. tears of joy... so good. so so good"
"473",4.5,"  im not here for graphic violence, everything else is great"
"474",3,"  Where to start with this one...To start off this movie is visually beautiful. The production design was very detailed and you could obviously tell that there was house of planning to make sure that every detail was executed perfectly. Now for the actually movie. I felt that this movie was very artistic in its approach which at some times made it hard to see the time of the movie. At times it was very lighthearted, funny, and fairy tale like. At other times it was very dark, extremely violent, and disturbing. The movie wasn't bad at all though, most of the characters were easy to relate too and the main actress, Sally Hawkins (Best Actress) is amazing. Her character is mute, but it doesn't seem like it. You could tell all of her emotion just by the way she carries herself. The main villain, Strickland was oddly menacing even though the actor, Michael Shannon is known for his funny roles. One the main woman's best friends, Giles, played by Richard Jenkings (Best Supporting Actor) brings such light to the movie that you would want him to be your own neighbor. The other best friend, who is played by Octavia Spencer (Best Supporting Actress) is funny and emotion in all of her screen time. I did not like the ending because I felt it was too unrealistic, even for a fantasy, but it made sense as to the type of love story they were trying to convey."
"475",3.5,"  A bit weird but not bad"
"476",0.5,"  Cliched characters, dull storyline and ridiculous premise. I tried to like this film but it was awful and weird."
"477",4,"  I loved the first half, and it was beautifully directed throughout (with exceptional production design) with a man intangible fairytale feeling but I could have definitely done without the overtly romantic relationship. You could have removed the sex scenes, kept everything else the same, and it wouldn't have lost any of its specialness."
"478",5,"  Beautiful in every sense of the word. Guilermo del Toro does a wonderful job that shows not only the good in the world, but also the bad. The soundtrack of the film is absolutely haunting, and adds to the beautiful narrative that is presented. One of the best films I've ever seen."
"479",4,"  I've been waiting to watch this film since its announcement, long before all the nominations in the various award ceremonies started making headlines. Imagine my surprise when I heard it was nominated for a ""Best Picture"" award from The Academy. As rare an occasion as they come because The Academy tends to not bother with films of such nature. Needless to say, my excitement to watch it grew exponentially. Unfortunately, 20 minutes in, I realized the film was clearly selected as a nominee for all the wrong reasons. Films should not have to be praising the things of old, the old era & old Hollywood in order to suck up to people in power & vice versa. People in power should know better than to be affected by elements such as these. It's the same cliche over & over again. Now when it comes to the movie itself, it's actually really good. Hawkins definitely steals the show by making something so absurd & inconceivable look believable & even lovable. Jenkins is brilliant as Giles & has justifiably snatched a ""supporting actor"" nomination though Spencer's nomination is rather questionable. She is fine in the film but does not provide anything spectacular or jaw-dropping, she is just a good supporting actress, nothing more. Del Toro's shots are often so mesmerizing you just want to pause & regard them & Desplat's music flows majestically through the film's dreamy sequences. The noir element is ever-present & Shannon elevates & glorifies it with his stellar performance as the film's villain.(Updated from 20/02/2018)"
"480",0.5,"  This movie is really bad. Apparently all white straight men are evil, and all minorities, women and gay people are angels. American white straight men are the worst, of course, and the 50's and 60's should not be thought of with any positive nostalgia. That's it. That's how Del Toro wants us to think, apparently. Wow. It's just dumb"
"481",5,"  Ho amato la delicatezza di questa pellicola, il rapporto fra la creatura (aspetto incredibile e recitazione magistrale) ed Elisa da sempre prigioniera di un mondo silenzioso.Guillermo Del Toro ci ha finalmente regalato un lieto fine!"
"482",4.5,"  I thought this a very surprising, interesting and at times down right magical. Superb cast, magnificent music and a eclectic vision of a special world. Highly recommend to classic movie goers"
"483",4,"  Artistically this film is fantastic. Every space is like its own character with its own mood and atmosphere. A lot of it has to do with light, whether it's the dimly lit hallway of Elisa's apartment, her bus rides in the twighlight, or harsh fluorescent lighting of the laboratory. This is the world in which the characters dwell. Outcasts of society - a mute woman, a gay man, an African American woman (to an extent), and a merman like creature - they find friendship and support and love in each other. The movie is a love story and a little bit of a thriller and a visual poem. But I feel that in order to fully appreciate it one needed to be fully immersed, and I kept getting thrown out. One problem was that as a native Russian speaker I found Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian hilarious and thus distracting. I also thought the whole Russian story line was rather wobbly, like it was there just to serve a purpose. Another element that felt contrived was the presence of three scars on Elisa's neck. The explanation they offered accounted for one scar, the other two seemed to be there for the sole purpose of being transformed at the end. The relationship between Elisa and the creature was beautiful, but I had to squash my queasiness when it went sexual. I mean, yes, he was intelligent and sensitive, and could sit at the table like a person eating his beloved eggs, but he wasn't human. Was it really necessary? And lastly, maybe that's just me and my dislike of gore, but was the last scene with the fingers necessary?The ending was really beautiful. I just wish I could stay with the film the whole time."
"484",3.5,"  Pleasurable, but not lasting."
"485",3.5,"  Another over-rated movie. Interesting premise but ultimately too engrossed in titillating the audience."
"486",5,"  Great movie!! Very surprised at just how good this film was! My favorite Del Toro film by far!!!!"
"487",5,"  One of the best movies of all time ! Last time I saw a good original movies like this was Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" 17 years ago !! Hollywood need more movies like this ,they have lost their way on remakes ,hope writers and producers take notice that you can still be creative and a commercial success at the same time !! If the movie didn't have the sexual connotations and scenes ,would definitely been a Family Golden Era Hollywood classic ! But this will definitely become a Cult Classic for sure !!"
"488",4.5,"  86/100""The Shape of Water"" marca el fantstico regreso de Guillermo del Toro al cine que ms aprecia y que mejor le sale, y es que consigue facturar con una magnifica puesta en escena y un inmejorable diseo de produccin; una tierna fbula sobre el amor y la diversidad que obviamente as como consigue maravillarte, tambin puede resultar algo difcil creerle su ingenuidad e inocencia pura, en la que Del Toro reimagina los clsicos de antao a su antojo para entregar su historia ms emotiva hasta la fecha, cargada de romance y algo de thriller perfectamente narrado, apoyada por el buen hacer de su reparto (Sally Hawkins est bien aunque no termina de bordarlo con su personaje, un siempre comprometido Doug Jones y un entraable Richard Jenkins), y la maravillosa banda sonora de Alexandre Desplat."
"489",1.5,"  Yet another La La Land in which the critics are bribe and cajoled into giving over zealous reviews of cheap mediocre films, La La Land got 98% ripe tomatoes when in reality it was 5 out of 100 at best at least this sorry excuse for a movie is probably 55% as opposed to the 92% being banded about. Don't be fooled into going to see this film it will just be a waste of your evening, I for one will not be taking any notice of of these bent critics in the future."
"490",5,"  Stunning visually and wonderfully paces, though it feels as if it drags in places- it doesn't stay that way for long. Beautiful, compelling and oddly sexy- this is totally a must see."
"491",3,"  Ok. Weird film. Didn't rate as highly as critics do."
"492",3.5,"  Es bonita, est bien hecha, tiene buenos actores (en especial la protagonista), la fotografa, el uso del color, los decorados... destila calidad y buen hacer. Ahora, no creo que sea para nominarla a 13 oscars. El principal problema que tiene es que la historia est muy vista. Es la Bella y la Bestia de nuevo. Pero bueno, an as entretiene bastante."
"493",3.5,"  I'm not sure I totally bought into this. Not sure how people think this is better than Pan's Labyrinth."
"494",0.5,"  I was a big fan of Del Toro but this one was the shape of my snoring"
"495",5,"  Everything is magnificent,the direction,photography,actors,music TRULY AMAZING"
"496",4.5,"  Good:Looks beautiful, like a fairy tale.Special effects top notchsally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins steal the filmMichael Shannon plays his role excellently( although it's nothing new for him)Admirably strange and memorable romanceFantastic musicBad:Although she's good in the film, Octavia Spencer plays the same role she always doesThe plot is well told but can be predictableBrilliant film."
"497",4.5,"  Gorgeous. The emotional beats sing, the acting is great across the board, and the limited special effects required are wonderfully executed."
"498",0.5,"  Talk about Zoofilia This movie disgusted me so bad, i left the theaters when i saw the directors demented movie and sickening way of infecting our minds in hope to see this as ""normal""Whats worse hollywood is filled with freaks who enjoy this and think this is art"
"499",4.5,"  This film is quite special for me. It's the first film (aside from standard Marvel/Star Wars etc. films) that I've actually been excited for, and anxiously awaiting it's release. Since it came out in America first, I also heard how good many people thought it was.Now, I haven't watched nearly as much of Guillermo Del Toro's work as I would have liked, and that's something i'm working to change, but I've enjoyed everything I've seen that he was linked to. This is the first of his works that I've seen in the cinema, and at this rate, he may end up as one of my favourite directors. Everything he does has tremendous style, whether it's a surreal 1960s romance featuring a fish man, or monoliths of metal and monsters clashing. Of course, The Shape of Water looks gorgeous despite it's relatively small budget of 19 million dollars. Despite how much I enjoyed Black Panther, TSoW had a budget 1/10th of the size and in my opinion, looked better. The creature effects were brilliant, and Del Toro captured the feel of the setting wonderfully. The music was quite gorgeous, and fit the setting remarkably. The soundtrack sounds like songs you might have heard at the time. It also captures much of the morbid whimsy the film holds throughout.Speaking of morbidity, I was surprised by the violence throughout the film. Despite my excitement for it's release, I'd never actually noted it's rating. I'd assumed it to be a PG-13 or something of the sort, but it holds (and earns) a hard R rating. The gore was almost distractingly good, and depending on the scene somebody watches, they could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a horror film.Surprisingly, I enjoyed every performance in the film. Sally Hawkins made good on a tremendous task; her character Elisa is mute throughout the film, and as a result, all of ehr acting must be done through body language and facial expression. This fact, coupled with the older setting, often reminded me of the classic silent films. Octavia Spencer also does wonderfully, and the duo have great chemistry despite the lack of words between the pair. Richard Jenkins also brought some much needed levity to many situations, while Michael Shannon gave our antagonist legitimate vulnerability, keeping him from remaining a simple, bland villain.Every character is interesting in their own way, and it's quite interesting seeing how this group of outcasts interacts with one another all throughout. There is a mute woman, a black lady, a gay gentleman, a Russian spy and a literal fishman, yet they all feel more human than our villain, despite how the world of the film may portray them.The plot, for the most part, is rather odd though I imagine this was intentional. The whole film feels rather akin to a fairytale, albeit a far more mature one with nudity and blood. Many times throughout the film, I felt extremely uncomfortable, though I feel this was the intended reaction; it really added to the scene, and the film overall. Even though I could tell the vague direction of the plot from the trailer alone, I wasn't at all disappointed after watching the film. The journey to the destination was far more important in this instance. I imagine you could even watch this film chopped up and reassembled in the wrong order; it looks simply gorgeous.Though, of course, I may be biased due to how excited I was for this film, I struggle to find many flaws with it. It just seems to have clicked with me, and at the risk of rating two films extremely highly right next to each other, I shall give this film a 9.5/10, especially due to it's budget. I don't give it a 10 simply because there was a few scenes which didn't land for me, though others seemed to enjoy them."
"500",5,"  One of the most sensational and sensitive movie I've ever seen!"
"501",2,"  Classic story of Girl meets fish, Girl falls in love with Fish; Girl and Fish run away. This was not a great movie by any stretch."
"502",5,"  One of the most amazing and sensitive movies I've ever seen!"
"503",5,"  Literally one of the best movies I've ever seen."
"504",3.5,"  I really like this movie. I like the visuals, I like the unusual story. So far from the movies I have seen nominated for Best Picture in 2017 this movie has my vote."
"505",5,"  The Shape of Water is an excellent film. It is about a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature in the 1960s. Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer give fantastic performances. The screenplay is well written. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the adventure and drama. The Shape of Water is is a must see."
"506",4,"  Visuals were cool, the look and feel of the movie were interesting, but I thought it moved too slowly."
"507",1.5,"  Amazingly boring. You'll probably be bored out of your mind too. Superbly pointless movie."
"508",4.5,"  emotional ad profound, really well done. it is a new story of love that go far beyond the use of speach."
"509",5,"  Cute. Maybe too much."
"510",4.5,"  An odd, visually stunning fairytale that is also immensely endearing, & magical. It is the first time in years that Guillermo del Toro has matched his absorbing imagination with an emotionally satisfying narrative, despite handling his villain once again with largely two-dimensional, obvious hand. The cast is all-around stellar but Sally Hawkins's performance is particularly phenomenal and Richard Jenkins is perfect in his supporting role. Both in story & filmmaking, this is arguably Del Toro's finest achievement and the ""most-complete"" film of the 2017 Best Picture nominees - 9/10"
"511",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is the type of film you could go to high and think is perfectly normal and go to sober and think is totally nuts, it was still a beautiful love story, albeit insane. Depends on what your motivation for seeing the movie was. If you went in thinking it was a cold war government conspiracy movie then that's really not the main focus of the film so you may not be all that interested. yes, there is some back story relating to the russians and the USA and there is some cold war tactics and it centered around that time but it's mainly the story of an alien and a human falling in love. It's mental but strangely beautiful."
"512",4.5,"  A delightfully constructed love letter the entire cinematic experience, and the golden era of filmmaking that inspired such talented minds that write and direct today such as Guillermo del Toro. The first time you watch this movie, you'll no doubt enjoy it. But by the second or third viewing, you'll realize The Shape of Water is del Toro's best film he's made - which is quite the statement if you're not someone who knows how great some of his earlier projects are.It leaves one with a sense of wonder, and what's most interesting is the impression that you're imbued with by the time the credits roll, which is the idea that del Toro could actually continue this upward trend and make EVEN BETTER movies; that he's perhaps only getting started...quite an impression, indeed. An instant classic, something often referred to these days, but rarely appropriated or assigned correctly. This time though the label has been earned and then some. Believe the hype. The fantastical romance with imagination may not be dead to all adults...when was the last time a work of art made us think about THAT?!?"
"513",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is a fascinating story well written and directed by Guillermo de Toro that shows the power of love and that doing the right thing and going with your instinct is usually the right thing to do. Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins all give amazing and emotional performances as well as Doug Jones playing the amphibian man. This romantic story has stunning visual work and cinematography that make the film what it is."
"514",3,"  Guillermo del Toro has come close to perfecting his own style that can be seen in most of his movies to date; stylistic historical fantasy put together with a classic but refreshing structure. However no matter how close it comes to perfection, it's a style I've never been too big of a fan of. The Shape of Water, among his other films, all feel like they're promising something that could really immerse us and give an emotional experience, but come out feeling it hasn't quite got there (at times it gets very close, the story surrounding Giles almost made me wanting it as a movie of its own). It's definitely worth a watch, but confirms that del Toro's style isn't wasted potential but a choice I just can't get into."
"515",5,"  Love this movie! One of my top 3 right here. Hope there is part 2, part 3 and so on!!"
"516",0.5,"  I am shocked this movie has received such acclaim. It is devoid of any real magic, full of plot holes and isn't worth your time. It attempts to gain your trust by referencing golden Hollywood classics, flounders to be deep by throwing in some Biblical references, and tries to be ""real"" by being gratuitously gritty, and instead ends up being a shallow dribble devoid of imagination."
"517",3,"  The expectation for this movie was higher."
"518",1,"  Terrible movie! The irrelevant nudity and masturbation scenes did not bother me as much as the horrible script which was chock full of negative stereotypes, grotesque personality flaws, and meaningless gruesome scenes. The joke is on the Oscar committee and us.... this was a satire designed to make movie critics look foolish, and it worked. But nothing else for this movie works. Guys, the Emperor has no clothes!"
"519",2,"  Overrated. Sorta Lame."
"520",0.5,"  Creature from the Black Lagoon with a big budget. Two hours of my life wasted. The best part of the experience was that ads before the feature. The movie's plot is as subtle as a brick. The bad guys all wear black hats. You have to completely suspend disbelief but for no good purpose. Hollywood has lost its mind. I can't imagine how this drivel garnered as many Academy Award nominations as it did. Clearly the PC nature of this film was playing a bigger role than something as banal as having a good storyline."
"521",5,"  A beautiful homage to movies like Creature from the Black Lagoon."
"522",5,"  My wife and I saw this movie twice, that's how much we enjoyed it. We enjoyed how it blended so many influences to create a magical world, magical characters and an interplay of stereotype and unique characters to provide insight and meaningful resonance."
"523",2,"  ""del Toro remakes Splash"""
"524",1,"  Movie not worth watching. It's boring and kinda weird. The protagonist is being intimate with ""It', unimaginable and kinda disgusting. Waste of time and money."
"525",4.5,"  Damn it, this film is gorgeous. A perfect example of how storytelling is better than a novel story. The direction, acting, cinematography, and soundtrack are excellent."
"526",0.5,"  I sat through 45 minutes of boredom to be rewarded by animal cruelty, there for I turned it off"
"527",5,"  Let your imagination wonder!"
"528",3.5,"  Quite enjoyable film that can't live up to its super high expectations. They call it a masterpiece, I beg to disagree."
"529",2,"  What the hell was this movie? Weird."
"530",3,"  Aquaman meets Cinderella! This film is one of the strangest romance fantasies I've seen in a long time. How the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" falls in love with a young mute woman, who gives him some hard-boiled eggs, plays some classical music, and she imagines dancing in a muscial film with the creature. It's a fun, interesting play on the possiblity of cross-species romance. If you can put you brain on hold, you might enjoy this movie."
"531",3.5,"  to keep it short, I thought the ""bad guy"" character was a Little forced and was given too much screen time, we get it, he's a bad person. I found this kept me from being emersied fully into this world. i would loved to have seen more of the relationship development in the laboratory.the film's music and cinematography was mesmerising i had a big smile on my face watching those beautiful scenes, i felt like i was falling in love which fully convinced me of the romantic relationship in the movie and erased any doubts in my mind about it. But some of gruesome scenes in my opinion where a little unnecessary, they overpowered the amazing romantic and magical feeling of the film.in conclusion, this film to me was a roller coater one minute im falling in love, and the next im feeling uncomfortable by the gruesome/dark scenes"
"532",0.5,"  This is one of the stupidest, most ridiculous films of all time!"
"533",4,"  Beautiful movie. Not my top choice for Best Picture, but I'm OK with it."
"534",5,"  The Shape of Water is an incredible, beautiful and sweet film that will touch hearts of moviegoers worldwide. A cautionary tale with a plethora of themes and messages that anyone can identify with. This will be a beloved classic, loved more and more with every re-watch. A magical, 'adult fairytale'."
"535",5,"  Wonderful history and awesome 50's adaptation. JUST GREAT!"
"536",1,"  One the worst movies I've seen! I walked out and asked for my money back. Sad because it had potential to be really good. It wasn't a movie about love at all... more like lust for a fish man. It was gory and disturbing. How could anyone want to get down with a fish man who's scales are decaying and flaking off? Then there's the mean boss with the rotten hand... just gross! Don't waste your money! If you really want to see it wait until it's for rent at the library."
"537",5,"  I believe now that the fish man saves her. Not the other way around. She was an evolved fish. The meeting was not really random because the fish man was a god. Great film"
"538",3,"  A very good movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it although I wish they'd gone into more detail and made it a bit longer."
"539",5,"  This movie was really well done. It is not very often that we can find a movie that involves a love story between a human woman and a male sea creature. There is still quite a bit of violence in this movie. Sally Hawkins character is wonderful."
"540",5,"  Essential cinema, an instant classic in my eyes. 20 years from now everyone will be saying you need to watch this (all those top 100 films before you die kinda thing!). The cinematography alone will keep this film beating for years to come. Go watch this!"
"541",4,"  incredibly well acted, fairly slow paced but magical at the same time. Not one to rush back to but a great watch at the same time."
"542",2.5,"  Not emotionally absorbing for me. At all. In the end I felt that I just could not care less about the characters."
"543",4.5,"  In what has now become known as his most gifted craft, Guillermo del Toro shares another facet of his fantastic ability to intertwine modern cinema with classic storytelling to create a mesmerizing picture that seems both warmly familiar and yet excitingly unique all at once. His tale is carefully articulated, molded with incredible performances from a perfectly cast ensemble, and ultimately delivers a love tale that transcends our cinema standards without the need for overbearing technologic reliance or cheapened screenwriting. This is a film that explores the art of the mise en scne in a glistening new lens, leaving us bewildered and stricken by its shape and form. Few could ever hope to capture the strangeness of such a love story and succeed as magnificently, but here we see Del Toro at his best, and with that we see pure, unfaltering beauty."
"544",0.5,"  It would have been a pretty good movie if it didn't have any of the following.- Showing the naked body in a bath scene is always unnecessary. We all have an imagination and I would rather use mine. -I don't think it's at all interesting or necessary to show someone masturbating. If they had left that out, the whole love scene with the creature would have been less gross and disgusting. And more innocent and beautiful. This backfired of them. - The animal cruelty. I cannot believe that they got away with having the creature eat the cat. And that they showed the cat's half eaten body. This was just wrong. Why couldn't they have stopped the creature before the cat got attacked?? Once again cruelty and images that were simply UNNECESSARY. - The way the sex scene with the security guy and his wife was filmed was also just really pointless. They couldn't have been under the blanket? Come on!It's always sad to see how all of the things that made the movie rated R, also ruined the whole experience. Because of the things I mentioned above, the movie lost its beauty. Nothing was even as funny as it could have been. I was just waiting for the movie to be over so I could find out how it ends. But it was NOT worth it."
"545",3.5,"  Nice fairy tale story and romance in cold war times."
"546",3.5,"  Puntaje Original: 7.5Cinematogrficamente hermosa y con un guin audaz, brillantes actuaciones, pero cabe resaltar el trabajo de Sally Hawkins, quien logra un nivel estelar. Notoria direccin de Del Toro y soberbio trabajo de produccin y maquillaje; un film muy completo en todos sus sentido, con una marcada tnica de Guillermo."
"547",0.5,"  One of the worst movies i've ever seen!"
"548",4,"  Sally Hawkins deserves better!"
"549",0.5,"  Probably the most pointless film ever...What a lot o single fish!!!"
"550",3.5,"  Superb cinematography. Great casting. Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon offers terrific performances. However, the unfortunate happy-ending seemed forced."
"551",5,"  The best film of 2018."
"552",5,"  This is a film about Iove. Sally Hawkins expresses it with with a a sensitiviy requiring not one word. Sure, it's a fairytale but it touches on the reality that love is a phenomenon outside of accepted norms and it does it beautifully. I loved the film."
"553",3.5,"  Between 3 and 3.5. Although sometimes too simple and difficult to believe (it seems to much easy to operate in a military-security building), it results a beautiful fable. Hawkins and the magic of Guillermo del Toro for scenography are great"
"554",5,"  I loved this movie, but its definitely not for everyone. Its a bit offbeat and not everyone's cup of tea."
"555",2,"  Amazing performances by Hawkins, Spencer, Shannon, and Jenkins. Enchanting production design, VFX, and original score. Yet I was not satisfied with this film especially all the hype about it. The concept of the film was original and the storytelling was good, but I felt uncomfortable while watching and wasn't mesmerized and gripped by the story as I hoped to be, I only felt disappointed if anything about the story."
"556",4,"  A POETIC PORTRAIT OF LOVEUnder the signature of the acclaimed Mexican director, Guillermo del Toro, The Shape of Water introduces us to a universe set in Baltimore (United States), during the Cold War period. With a unique aesthetic and under a green light filter, we witness a narrative that faithfully portrays the human species and its mechanisms of marginalization, where aspects such as belonging and loneliness, love and death are combined in a fantastic fable.At the beginning of the film, the director invites us to enter to the private life of Elisa Esposito, a young woman who lives in a small apartment above a movie theater, to which life is solitary and routine. Every day she makes the same trip by train to her work; a government laboratory designed to investigate and develop tools to combat the war. There she spends her working day accompanied by Zelda, an African-American woman who shares her marital problems while cleaning the laboratory facilities.During her free time, she shares lots of sweet pie with Giles, a frustrated illustrator who does not find recognition with his works, and is constantly questioned about his sexual orientation.However, one day Elisa's reality seems to break down, and little by little she finds herself involved in a special relationship with a captive being that means a danger (or an advantage) for the group of scientists.Where she begins to recognize herself in him, and he in her, as beings capable of achieving a unique and special communication, devoid of speech but enriched by movement and music. Because at the end of the day, both are social phenomena, locked in and forced to stay out of a society that excludes them because of their uniqueness and uses them to the extent of their functionality.This is how Richard Strickland, the antagonistic character is forced to kill the amphibian, hastening Elisa to draw up a rescue plan, which will have the help of a Russian spy scientist, and that will lead to the coexistence of both on the floor of her apartment, bringing a host of inconveniences that will further narrow their relationship, moving the link to the more carnal aspects of relationships.Finally, we must not forget that it is not accidental that the director has included the presence of a cinema, so close to our protagonist, who, along with the stories told there, lives in a dream world, where everything is possible, mainly extraordinary love"
"557",1,"  I love original film, especially the ones that challenge the viewer and even offend many (mother! last year is a great example). This, while definitely original, is just a very bad film in general. Creating a sexual romance between a human and a fishman just.. did not work for me at all. I felt absolutely nothing for either of these characters because we're given nothing to care about, other than the fact that they feel alone. A+ writing right there! The plot is offensively predictable, and so, so dull. It has quite possibly one of the worst endings to a film I have ever seen. Dreadful. Watch at your own risk."
"558",0.5,"  Save your money.This movie was completely and utterly stupid, and I wish I could have my time and money back."
"559",4,"  I never really bought fully into the central romance. But it was beautiful, the tone was perfect, the characters wonderfully full, the performances delightfully nuanced, and the outsider theme resonated. I didn't love it, but I did like it, very much so."
"560",0.5,"  falls in love with a fish and has sex with it. So boring."
"561",5,"  truly mesmerising fantasy movie epic in style and as a story. really enjoyed it"
"562",3.5,"  Is it called beastiality if it's with a humanoid but interspecies creature?"
"563",1,"  Perhaps the most overrated movie of the year. It is aimed at making any type of love, including that between a woman and an animal or thing, acceptable. It takes the liberal agenda one step too far."
"564",2,"  One of the most cheapest story ever."
"565",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro has captured the sensation of loneliness. Sally Hawkins dazzles with a rare grace and Doug Jones radiates as always. Together, mixed with the outstanding score from Alexander Desplat, they wordlessly and beautifully guide us from scene to scene."
"566",3.5,"  Brilliantly different."
"567",5,"  Not usually a fan of romance films, but this is by far the best romance film I've ever seen."
"568",4,"  Excellent extremely well acted and completely bonkers at the same time. Well worth a watch.."
"569",5,"  A perfect fairytale of a film. We both loved it."
"570",4,"  Guillermo del Toro tervnder till sina ""Pans labyrint""-dagars glans fr en modern saga med stmning och skdespelande i toppklass"
"571",1,"  I'm with critic Rex Reed. I saw this at the Napa Valley Film Festival. I left 10 minutes before it was over. A ""nice, lovable"" monster having sex with a mute? The real monster in the movie reinforced that we have enough real life monsters in our lives! I couldn't take another minute of this one! I did return after the credits rolled for the interview with the actors. Everybody agreed afterwards that Shannon was bizarre and seemed stoned which reinforced my poor impression of the film and the people responsible for making it."
"572",5,"  Qu experiencia ms hermosa y conmovedora La Forma Del Agua. Guillermo del Toro logra algo excepcional aqu. Sally Hawkins est perfecta en su bellsimo rol y Doug Jones entrega otro de sus icnicos papeles. Michael Shannon, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, todos brillantes."
"573",2,"  Fantastically shot and very atmospheric but a poorly assembled plot that defies belief and logic.Only watch if you are interested in Human + Non Human intercourse cause that's what you will get half way through this film."
"574",3,"  Hmmm...ok but not much more than that. It's a sort of Beauty and the Beast/ King Kong thing. We were fascinated that everyone decides the creature is a male when there is no visible evidence of wedding tackle. Luckily for the heroine, he has, as she explains to all of us pondering this mystery, some sort of retractable trouser snake, which appears concealed behind some sort of sliding door arrangement. If l had been her l would have checked this out first. But then she does appear to have pretty low standards in her choice of men. She could have saved herself the trouble and got herself something equally slimy by going clubbing in Wrexham of a night."
"575",4.5,"  Thanks to its deeply immersive production design, gorgeous imagery, one deeply emotional and thought-provoking story about love, xenophobia, political interests and moral ambiguity, profound symbolism, a stellar cast led by one outstading Sally Hawkings and Alexandre Desplat's wonderful score, Guillermo del Toro's romantic drama ""The Shape of Water"" easily stands out as one of the best films of 2017."
"576",5,"  amazing. acting is beautiful, cinematography is wonderfully done. in my opinion, it's a must see."
"577",4,"  Finally I got around to see the shape of water. Its full of wonderful performances, sharp screenplay and supreme visuals. It has some charming characters. It has some awkward moments for sure but that is just part of the charm and innocence. My only criticism is the rushed and fairytale like ending. This should have been better explained. Still very nice cinema and a wonderful story."
"578",5,"  The Shape of Water tells a beautiful story that breaks your heart and heals it. It is a little on the nose, with cut-out-for-children morals and almost caricatures of characters, but it WORKS."
"579",4,"  Beautiful movie well crafted a fairytail on an adult level!"
"580",4.5,"  Rarely, a movie so bizarre, so dark sometimes and so fantastic like only Guillermo del Toro can do, can be simultaneasly so romantic and beautiful. ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the most beautiful romances f 2017 and of the decada. Del Toro shined in the direction chair and created one of his best. Sally Hawkins plays one of the most passioning characters of the year, Michael Shannon is just pure evil, Richard Jenkis is extremely kind and Octavia Spencer is absolutely hilarious. A Cold War drama like we never watched before. Love each other, people!"
"581",0.5,"  Awful movie...period!"
"582",5,"  A cherish-able treat for film fans. This entrancing visual spectacle bubbles with a delightful mystery. It celebrates love and individual difference through the well-told story's wholesome characters, all superbly performed."
"583",4,"  Visually mesmerising. A couple of clue scenes that are so vividely impressed in my mind. Octavia Spencer and Sally Hawkins are incredibly talented. The plot is so, so but the characters make up for all that was missing in the depth of the story. Vote: 7.5"
"584",3,"  'The Shape Of Water' feels like the realization of a del Toro fan-fiction that spawned somewhere between Hellboy and Pacific Rim. The drawback is that not much of the movie feels original. and most of the rest seems staged and overly dramatized, going out of its way to break my suspension of disbelief. The stars of the show are the romantic focus of the story: they do an amazing job of feeling authentic and passionate, making the bizarre love aspect my absolute favourite part of the film. It's kind of sad though that it was so underutilized. Either way, the movie does a good enough job of not being a wreck, and amid all the cliche cutout characters and the eye-roll-inducing quoting of Bible verses, there's a decent, heartwarming story."
"585",3.5,"  Less is more... a rich, detailed mounting. Sally Hawkins is quiet, confident and ably supported by Richard Jenkins and the rest of the cast."
"586",1,"  How does this movie have 92% movie full of naked / sex references that brings nothing to the movie. Intercourse woman / manfish? close to zoophilia ! This was carp (got the joke?)"
"587",0.5,"  It was the most disturbing movie I ever saw.It was a struggle to watch until the end.I didn't like it at all. I found it completely out of logic or meaning.I hate this movie."
"588",4.5,"  Some of Del Toro's best directing. Only issue is Eliza and The Amphibian Man's relationship felt a little one-sided, and I needed more of a personality from him. But the more they give him, the more risk of him becoming a stock/cliched character, so I understand they were cautious about that."
"589",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro once again brings his love for monster horror and makes it naturally sweet. What this film does is develop certain characters scene by scene, in no small part by the performances by Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, and especially Doug Jones as the one creature. And the heavy-handed Cold War ideas that were prevalent make it all the more fitting for the chance to sympathize - and fall in love - with what is essentially a B-movie monster."
"590",0.5,"  King Kong with Russians. This is what happens when you have wonderful set designers, a great cinematographer but no story. Avoid this drivel."
"591",3,"  Yes, this is a beautifully-crafted love story, the colors are stunning, the acting is generally solid (not incredible, though, but read on for more on that), and there is some curious magic to an inter-species sex scene. But, I have just covered all that is great about this film. The rest is simply good. Sally Hawkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer were all good-to-very-good, depending on the scene. And I'm also a big fan of all of them, it should be said. But man, were they all actiiiiiiiiiiing. The only great performance in the movie was Richard Jenkins, who surprised the hell out of me. Otherwise, acting as well as the writing both made me like I was watching a movie, not being immersed into this great, modern Fairy Tale that everyone is talking about. The Shape of Water is Oscar bait (pardon the pun) at its core and it is likely to be rewarded as such despite being a highly derivative story and borrowing its entire style from video games of the past (e.g. BioShock). This is a good movie and this is bound to be a safe year for the Oscars as they go in cycles. It's the perfect, glittery follow-up winner to the raw Moonlight, which won out over glitter-bomb La La Land last year. A final note: Can we talk about how we know nothing about the relationship between Hawkins and Jenkins' characters and never find out anything out about the Monster outside of him being inexplicably friendly towards a mute girl?"
"592",0.5,"  just a rehashing of Pan's Labyrinth. Virtually identical in every way."
"593",5,"  Beautifully done - beautifully acted - it has the strange del toro edge which i am not always fond of, but he softened it a bit for this movie and it worked. Excellent cast and effects"
"594",5,"  Visionrio no  um adjetivo que se aplique a qualquer diretor, mas encaixa que nem uma luva a Guillermo del Toro. O seu cunho pessoal na direo  algo que podemos observar desde a sua primeira longa-metragem, Cronos (1993), uma abordagem diferente aos filmes de vampiros. Desde ento, o seu trabalho tem sido admirado, mas foi fora de Hollywood que o diretor orquestrou a sua obra-prima: Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Os seus filmes espanhis possuem uma voz distinta no mundo cinematogrfico, algo que se distancia do blockbuster de 2013, Pacific Rim. Agora, com o seu mais recente projeto premiado (co-escrito com Vanessa Taylor), Del Toro criou um hbrido que  to pessoal como universal, um romance melodramtico que reestrutura os temas clssicos de Beauty and the Best (1991) e alarga os horizontes da mensagem.Uma voz estabelece a fbula que se avizinha, introduzindo a histria ""h muito tempo atrs"", numa ""pequena cidade perto da costa, mas longe de tudo o resto"". Estamos a falar dos Estado Unidos em meados dos anos 60, com a Guerra Fria e a corrida para chegar ao espao a funcionar enquanto plano de fundo da narrativa, que envolve vrios gneros cinematogrficos, mas que  mais do que a soma das suas partes.Num laboratrio subterrneo secreto, cientistas estudam uma criatura (Doug Jones) que foi capturada na Amrica do Sul.  humanoide, mas luxuosamente anfbia, com guelras, espinhos e dentes afiados. Um temvel agente do governo, Strickland (Michael Shannon), supervisiona os experimentos na criatura, na esperana de conseguir informaes que colocariam os Estados Unidos em vantagem sob os russos. neste ambiente obscuro que Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) brilha, muda desde o dia em que foi encontrada ""ao p de um rio, na gua"", com cicatrizes no pescoo que justificam o seu silncio. Elisa trabalha nas limpezas do laboratrio e vive por cima de uma sala de cinema, um palcio  moda antiga onde The Story of Ruth (1960) e Mardi Gras (1958) esto em cartaz, mas com poucos interessados. Os seus melhores amigos so o seu vizinho (Richard Jenkins), um homem homossexual e a sua colega de trabalho (Octavia Spencer), uma mulher afro-americana. Como o seu trabalho lhe permite entrar em reas restritas do laboratrio, ao aperceber-se da criatura e dos maus tratos a que era submetida, Elisa tenta conectar-se com ele e faz-lo sentir melhor.O que se segue  um estranho e maravilhoso romance de suspense, inspirado em filmes de monstros dos anos 50 como Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), at  comdia romntica dos anos 80 de Ron Howard, Splash (1984). Personalidades do cinema mudo como Keaton e Chaplin e musicais ao estilo de Astaire e Ginger Rogers, fazem parte da fundao para The Shape of Water.Pode at suar ridculo no papel, mas a astcia de Del Toro faz com que tudo resulte. O facto de Elisa ser muda coloca-a em p de igualdade com a criatura. Sinais, linguagem gestual e msica so os veculos da sua unio, e atravs de uma estranha magia, tudo parece fazer sentido.Existem sequncias musicais onricas e realismo mgico, mas tambm violncia, sangue e duras realidades.  um conto de fadas, sim, mas tambm um grito de luta pelas minorias, algo que podemos observar na caracterizao das personagens que esto to bem escritas como interpretadas.Embora seja difcil encontrar destaques nas atuaes, o corao do filme  a performance de Hawkins, que utiliza cada msculo da sua expresso para interpretar uma mulher que no consegue emitir sons mas cujas emoes trespassam plenamente.O guarda-roupa de Luis Sequeira e a produo de design de Paul D. Austerberry do vida a este fantstico mundo verde-azulado, enquanto a direo de fotografia de Dan Laustsen flui com naturalidade pelas guas da narrativa.The Shape of Water  um filme para descobrir e redescobrir.  primeira vista,  um banho de maravilhosos e sinistros momentos, com imagem esbelta. Com o tempo, a sua melancolia sedutora e os seus significados ganham forma, e emergem  superfcie.9,2/10"
"595",4,"  Not quite as touching, colorful or brutal as Pan's Labyrinth, but a masterpiece nonetheless. Has a quiet sweetness to it without emotion or tension being absent, and terrific performances."
"596",5,"  A truly beautiful story and movie. Guillermo del Toro is a genius."
"597",2,"  I love art house movies! But not this one. Being arty just for the sake of being artistic works to get Oscar nominations, apparently. It does not work for me. The story is an indirect copy of the amazing French movie 'Amelie' with a sea monster added. If characters are not well introduced they will not get sympathy from the audience. I didn't feel anything for the fake love story between the protagonist and the monster, because it was based on nothing. Great cast and of course great acting from experienced actors, but if the story is not right it doesn't elevate, it doesn't move and it will not inspire you. Let's be honest, that's what we all look for in a movie. The committee of the Oscars must have had a hard time making choices. The selection seems to be a confusing one, from intense love dramas to fantasy stories without depth. If this movie wins more than 1 Oscar the credibility of the ceremony will be under fire, as it is every year. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter"
"598",5,"  this was a sleeper hit I thought it was great loved Doug Jones as the creature"
"599",3.5,"  The movie has very good visuals. I think the under eye level camera shooting was fantastic cinematography. It was tight and in your face. The acting was spot on. I loved the film but for the plot - the plot was very simple and has been. Good cinema, yet not powerful."
"600",4.5,"  I thought it was beautiful, well-crafted, and original. Cinematography was beautifully shot, it was well acted all around. This is an instant classic. Possibly Guillermo's best movie."
"601",3,"  Hard to buy into this plot, but it's another story of a woman that can see past physical attraction and fall in love."
"602",4.5,"  This is a beautiful, love story combining fantasy with reality. I was mesmerized for two hours. I love Sally Hawkins and this movie doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb. It is a true good vs evil story, where I found that I was rooting for an Amazonian monster, believing he was real. See this movie with a group of friends and save time for discussion after the film. There are so many layers to this film. I am so grateful that I saw it, I can't wait to see how it does on Oscar night."
"603",3,"  This film is certainly 'different' and that seems to get the high scores on Rotten Tomatoes. But that does not mean it's always brilliant. I saw this one at the Cinema, but probably should have waited for the DVD. Quite good, but watching this one time is enough."
"604",5,"  Could not fault it. Alot of plot packed in to 2 hours."
"605",4,"  This was a great movie! Hits all the boxes. Won't be surprised to see Guillermo win the Best Director Oscar!"
"606",1,"  Porn meets alien. Disturbing and main character masturbates 5 minutes into the movie! Very bizarre. Horny, lonely girl meets, falls in love with and has sex with fish, monster man. Sick. Skip this one."
"607",1,"  Not so subtle attack on American culture. Whites bad, blacks good; men weak or cruel, women intelligent and brave; American government bad, Russian scientist compassionate. Heterosexual characters seen as obtuse and mean, while homosexual characters portrayed as caring and loving. Married father is distant and self absorbed and seeking extramarital affair, while single female is portrayed as loyal. The name of the movie should have been called ""I hate white, heterosexual, patriotic gun owning males""."
"608",4,"  A bizarre story but a great film and well worth all the Oscar nominations. Eliza is a mute janitor at a top secret government building holding a sea creature found in South America. She becomes curious and gains actress to the lab. Slowly she grows fond of the creature and builds a friendship with the help of eggs, sign language and music. When she heard they plan to kill the monster she plans to help it escape with the help of friends Zelda and Giles and houses the creature at her house and and to set him free. Very enjoyable tender love story of a mute woman and sea creature who find they have a lot in common. Very imaginative film from Guillermo del Toro"
"609",5,"  It's like an Abe Sapien origin movie!"
"610",5,"  excellent movie, what we come to expect from Del Toro."
"611",4,"  Trzy Kolory: Zielony"
"612",4.5,"  What to say about this movie? Gorgeous?Beatiful?Spectacular?Or the three together?The Shape Of Water is a film that can transmit beatiful emotions, in a very simple way.We recognize the ""Fish"" as an human, and we can the understand the fury of the villain, and the love of the protagonistThe 13 nominations for the Oscars are understandable, so as the great critic response..It can be sometimes boring, for those who don't care much about emotions and art.The Shape of Water can be funny, or be the most cruel movie of the world, but Del Toro can balance both very well, great perfomances, musics and great story."
"613",4,"  Spielbergian in its setting and atmosphere, 'Shape of Water' is a bewitching blend of fantasy, romance and spy thriller. GDT has created something instantly memorable."
"614",4,"  I ended up watching this movie as I am a huge fan of Doug Jones (Star Trek-Discovery, Hellboy,...) and Guillermo del Toro. This is a beautiful love story in told in that special way Guillermo has. Michael Shannon's part was definitely made for him. Enjoy!"
"615",3.5,"  First class del toro, Amelie crosses with pans labyrinth, with a very stylish 1960s Cold War look. Always rated sally hawkins since happy go lucky, but I am pleased and at the same time amazed that she was picked for this role over any other Hollywood ubiquitous actress. This is a fascinating story, the sets and visuals are on a par with pans labyrinth. Not sure del toro will ever top this"
"616",3.5,"  Original story. I enjoyed it."
"617",3,"  Everything is perfect but not a single thrill of emotion"
"618",3,"  Like all del Toro and Shyamalan movies this is 75% a good movie. Then it goes off the rails. This could have been a prequel to Abe Sapien but isn't. There are some disturbing concepts."
"619",4,"  Weird & wonderful. Another hit from Guillermo del Toro![8/10]"
"620",3,"  Like marmite, I hate it. Oscar seeking production which drifts off into wild laughable fantasy. Time I cannot ever get back wasted."
"621",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro made Pan's Labyrinth, which in my humble opinion is one of the greatest films ever made. This isn't tehre, but it's very good. An achingly beautiful story about alienation, love and loneliness. It's cinematically gorgeous, as you would expect from Del Toro, and the acting is splendid throughout."
"622",5,"  a totally different movie than what is playing right now. I totally enjoyed it and I've seen it two times."
"623",4,"  4/5 Guillermo Del Toro is, in my opinion, one of the greatest directors out there especially when it comes to creature features. I've seen all of his films and loved every single one. This one is along the lines of The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. A fantastic drama about a woman who falls in love with an amphibian man who looks an awful lot like Abe Sapien from Del Toro's Hellboy films. Overall this movie was a fantastic, almost throwback to Del Toro's earlier, less action oriented films."
"624",3.5,"  The Creature from the Black Lagoon finds out the deaf, dumb, and mute girl is really one of his species with neck gills and all. Aquaman dates Debbie Does Dallas!"
"625",5,"  This movie is pure magic!"
"626",4,"  The Shape of Water is a surprisingly engrossing romantic fantasy tale, and is a visual treat. Sally Hawkins gives an impressive performance as the mute cleaner who works a highly secretive government laboratory. The ensemble cast is top class, but Michael Shannon is simply brilliant as the antagonist - the civil servant and government agent - and makes you wonder who's really the true monster. He's the actor to watch! A work of ambitious direction, as the following themes are played out: isolation vs freedom; deception vs truth; lust vs love. I especially enjoyed the different levels of loyalties being played out and tested. Absorbing and enjoyable."
"627",4.5,"  Loved it uniquely entertaining."
"628",5,"  Clear Oscar winner for me. It has everything."
"629",0.5,"  SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH A FISH"
"630",4,"  While the movie starts out rather strangely, with two masturbation scenes and one overdrawn sex scene in the first thirty minutes, it becomes a genuinely enchanting experience. The new, more adult, romance between a human and a monster completely overshadows the pure cliche-fest of Beauty and The Beast. The finale is perfectly played out, with the relatable anti-hero meeting his doom and the heroine getting her wish. Underlying tones, such as racial issues and discrimination against women in the workforce, and a charming story, make this one of Del Toro's best movies."
"631",5,"  Intresting plot really makes us think about life after watching defenitly recommending it."
"632",1.5,"  Or the return of the Creature of the black Lagoon. 64 years later, the shape of water fits well in the category of a B movie from the 1950s, but with expensive taste: the classic cold war characters, the misunderstood and exploited class, the oppressive elites... and among all this, a surprising love. Visually recreating faithfully the atmosphere of the late 1950s-early 1960s, del Toro mixes the 1950s B movie monster genre with magic realism. The result is not a success. Characters are flat although well acted, dialogues are obvious, and except for a few moments, the 2h movie feels loooong. I wanted to empathise but after waiting too long, I got bored. How it has been nominated for an Oscar is beyond me."
"633",4,"  Falta sentimento ao que  exposto."
"634",5,"  One of the best movies i have ever seen.Definitely worth a watch !"
"635",3,"  ?????????? ?????????? ??? Amelie, ???? ????, ???? ???? ????, ???? ?????????? ? ??????????????, ??????? ???????? ???????, ?? ?? ???? ????????. ??? ?? ????? ?? ?? ???????, ???????? ??????????? ??????, ?????? ???? ??????? ???????????"
"636",4.5,"  A modern fairytale set in a classic time with superb special effects and nostalgic setting. Great acting and story which, although plays out pretty much as expected, was still a treat to watch. Emotional and heartwarming with a sprinkle of dark, funny and ""magic"" moments, the film is entertaining and good throughout."
"637",4.5,"  The Shape Of Water is an emotional tale of lonely people and outsiders meeting each other, disguised as an exquisite romance between two people incapable of speech. The fact that this was made for $20 million is a testament to the producers as this looks like it would rather have cost $100 million. Sally Hawkins gives a fantastic performance, as does Octavia Spencer, and the two make a perfect mash. Richard Jenkins also served as a subtle comedic relief, that actually worked, and stayed integral to the plot. For me, personally, Michael Stuhlbarg was the stand out character. The fact that del Toro can handle a Soviet spy in such a respectful, and understanding way, without having him fall into any kind of clichs that a less skilful director would resort to. The creature effects, as is in character for del Toro, were excellent. The use of colour throughout was fairy-tale lack, giving the story a certain enchantment. While no elements of the score particularly stood out to me, I still remember in particular silent scenes, that it carried the entire emotional drive. The cinematography gave such a wide breadth of 1962 America and completely sucked one into the environment. The only error that I could point out throughout was Michael Shannon's character, who was an incredible missed opportunity, for yet another lonely person seeking real love in this world. I have never been more convinced of two character's love for each other in my life. A fantastic film by a fantastic visionary."
"638",5,"  Now that is a movie. I always liked Del Toro, but he moved to a new height here..."
"639",4.5,"  A film that goes from the playful French play ""the fabulous destiny of Amlie Poulain"" to the Japanese trash ""Guinea Ping"". A film of immersion and construction of impeccable characters. Guilherme Del Toro builds a plot with several narrative mirrors to the ""labyrinth of the faun"", a fairy tale that blends the brutality of human nature, a conjecture about love. hatred, depression and self-assertion. The screenplay for ""La forma da Agua"" tells us a bizarre, gothic love story that brings with it a series of characteristics, which are supported by its many and fabulous characters, which for me is the high point of script, the construction of characters, we have a character in search of love and its counterpoint, the one that is already sick of love, we have characters in search of self discovery, and in contrast, a character who has already discovered himself, and why , must be self-affirming. That is, the romance between a woman and a sea creature is only an excuse to explore and unite the most diverse human feelings and anguishes, and even this novel being diminished in my text in the film, it is absurdly explored, from this solitude and abstinence lived by the character of Sally Hawkins that ends up triggering in her a curiosity to the new, and even the fact that it is mute, this creates a bond with the creature, and leaves the scenes very the most beautiful because we have only the visual resource to contemplate the passion of the two, passion that transcends morality or language, is only one character completing the emptiness of the other and communicating through the universal language of love, Romantic too? may be, because the whole movie behaves like a French novel of the 90s, with some small shocks of reality, we can not fail to mention how much the dialogues are sharp and very clever. The moral of the film is really talking about the peculiarities of its characters, that although the world was in the 60s, the most primitive human feelings still stood out, and people, even the ""Villains"" had their dramas, because the Michael Shannon's character is completely broken, he's a villain who needs to stay down every second self-asserting, that leaves him completely meticulous and scary, yet human. Technically the film is impeccable, with a palette of greenish colors, an edition that cadenza well the rhythm of the film, great edition and sound mixing, besides an enviable production design and impeccable costumes and a soundtrack that strolls through songs of the years 40,50,60 always in a light way that combines a lot with the film and makes the viewer fall in love with Del Toro's feature film. Guilherme Del Toro, alias, who can win his first Oscar, the fabulous director directs a film almost completely perfect, showing that ""The Labyrinth of Fauno"" was not only luck but the competence of the Mexican director, who enchants with his monsters, script and technique, although I think that ""Labyrinth Do Fauno"" is still his masterpiece, but ""The form of Agu"" is the film that will open the director's quality to the world. All the actors in the film are spectacularly great, Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins make a perfect trio of performances, and all of them were very well rewarded for their great performances, but I wanted to mention also Michael Shannon, who even a little forgotten in awards, looks great in his role, the actor has a magnificent screen presence. The film only ends in its act of completion, the film ends at the wrong time, and we do not have the dualism between real and ludic that I expected, in addition to the film little explore the drama of Michael Stuhlbarg, finally, ""The form of Water"" is one of the great films of 2018, is a work indispensable to the lovers of cinema."
"640",3,"  The Shape of water depends on it's container. Very miss leading title"
"641",3.5,"  Grade: A-Rating: R, 119 minutesIn a Nutshell: Certified fresh! This ""adult fairy tale"" was produced, directed, and written by Guillermo Del Toro. The film combines a love story with science fiction and Cold War drama. Some critics have likened it to Beauty And The Beast meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. It's odd, for sure.This film has received more Oscar nominations than any other film! Many of them are technical noms. We'll see how many they win.Tips for parents: This movie is rated R for a reason. It's not appropriate for children's viewing.A LOT of full frontal nudity of a woman. Another woman opens her shirt to reveal her bare chest.Woman pleasures herself in a bathtubCrude language, F-bombs, and profanityYou see a married couple have sex.You learn sign language for some words.RacismHomosexualityHypocrisy Hope, compassion, humanityUplifting theme: Feeling incomplete and unfulfilled in life and how we fill that void.Love can't be defined.Humanity, outsidersFriendship, loyaltyThings I liked:Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance with no words. Guillermo Del Toro said that he wrote the movie with only her in mind. Her character's last name is ""Esposito"" which is Italian, given to orphaned children, meaning ""exposed"" or ""abandoned.""Michael Shannon is fantastic, as always. He successfully makes you hate his guts. The talented ensemble also includes Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, and Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer.Some people watch a classic scene from a Shirley Temple movie. Music and dance play a role in the movie.Beautiful production design with incredible colors. It uses practically every shade of green.I loved the Old Hollywood nods to lots of other movies.A surprising musical number.Doug Jones spent three hours every day to get into his costume.Things I didn't like:Way too much nudity, awkward sex, and crude language.The end is pretty predictable.A bit of a creepy love affair.Interesting lines:""He's not even human."" - Giles (Richard Jenkins)""If we do nothing, neither are we."" - Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins)""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans."" - Daily Thought""I'm not a good liar...except Bruster. It takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going."" - Zelda (Octavia Spencer)"
"642",5,"  This movie was fantastic, in my opinion. I went into it thinking it would be weird and kind of awkward. Yes, it was, but in the best kind of way. I actually came to love this story and it did get me to feel the feels."
"643",5,"  I loved this movie. The romance is great and the villan makes you want him to die"
"644",3,"  I felt it couldn't decide what it wanted to be - science fiction, thriller, spy or love story - perhaps that was the point, to surprise you, but it would have been better to concentrate on one genre. The Water character looked amazing, but the reality holes were too glaring. Had it been on TV, I would have switched over"
"645",0.5,"  simply a horribly boring movie"
"646",4,"  I loved the beginning of the movie when a very innocent looking girl (hawkins) gets in a bad and start masturbation. Not at all what I was expectation. It set's the tone for the rest of the movie. It doens't really mind the you know precisely where the movie is going. Sally is just a wonderfull actress and also the suporting roles (Shannon, Jenkins and Spencer) are superb. Love it!"
"647",3.5,"  I enjoyed the movie, but I don't see what all of the praise is about. It is a generic romance movie, but substitute the misunderstood man with a misunderstood monster."
"648",0.5,"  Still mopping up the mess."
"649",5,"  GDT at his best! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! His best film thus far!!"
"650",0.5,"  I honestly think I watched a different movie then anyone who thought this movie was good. I didn't like any characters, and when did bestiality become cool. worst movie I've ever seen and in a bad way. At least bad movies like The Room are fun to talk about, this is just horrible."
"651",5,"  Stunningly beautiful film. Guillermo del Toro found the same muse that inspired Pan's Labyrinth. Michael Shannon is on point. His character was as grotesque and evil as Sally Hawkins' was pure and loving."
"652",3.5,"  Underwhelmed as far as my expectations.. BUT.. still the likely Best Picture winner"
"653",1,"  I was not emotionally engaged at all. Movie tries, but tries too hard"
"654",5,"  This is a fabulous, humanistic movie! Great cinematography, great sound track, incredible special effects, and deeply moving and emotional story-line!"
"655",4.5,"  A film full of meanings about the differences of the living beings in this planet. Everyone deserves to be loved and accepted for what we are."
"656",4,"  It's like Amelie and Beauty and the Beast had some weird ass sex and also more nude scenes. Really cool though."
"657",5,"  (6.0 out of 6)- Discomfort to ComfortWhen we see what places are safe and sound to enjoy the comforts of what such time will bring. When what places we see sounds for another day in our comforting life we see it's time to get up. When we don't see what other places are discomforting to know what sounds those bring when it's time to fight crime.*When we see what brings all sights, sounds, comforts of life in one place and time that takes us to other places more comforting. When we see what place and time it is to know all discomforts we may face being who we are in a man's world that puts us out of place. When we see what places those hold for us when the time is strict that puts us out of the workplace to know what discomforts we live by. When we see its always comforting to have those in the same place as we are amongst those in high places to know how time flys with those by our side. When we see what place others rather be when it's home to see all comforting places & time we are put in our place. When we see what place we make time for when it is comforting, to make such places routine when we have to be in other places less comforting to make time for the place that takes us to other comforting places. When we see what place could use our time and company when it's places of comfort that others don't have time to go see when busy places don't have time for timeless places like movie theatres. When we see what places others enjoy when it's being served, having everything prepared and handed to them when the time of full functionality in the workplace keeps everyone in place and time to know what comforts those on top keep an eye on and discomforts of those who are being watched need to abide to. When we see what places that come from higher places to see what such places has to offer, we see a time of discomfort when the world is in competition from business to politics to know what such discomfort brings to deliver the next technological revolution. When we see it is always great to share what we see is comforting with others who share what is comforting to know what place we share in common that the world doesn't see, when the time of change pushes power ahead of powerless that we see transitioning from one time to another we lose such places. When we see what place those will lose to only break them out, when old places and new places are no longer wanted that they find themselves in a time where higher places wish to move forward to a more comforting place in weaponry to protect what discomforts us, threats from our enemies. When we see that there is no place and time moving forward with those who we share such comforting place with we see what we must protect to get out. When we see what place we go to protect those from threats we see that time only puts those in discomfort when it isn't real and we see a comforting time turn discomforting when we see ourselves as threatening to the world when our actions in the pursuit of power dehumanizes us. When we see living in such comforting places of promise, we see it's compromised when it comes at the cost of other places when time reveals all scars and lack of authenticity in the places we live in, that it becomes discomforting to know it's not real. When we see the only place that we can share such places with those that share in the comforts of natural places we see what time will takes us, when it's hidden, below those who are shallow, and in discomforting places that we need to get used to.When we don't always see how great advancements come to be that we see that we put many in discomfort for the pursue of science when time & competition was a stake to know what comforts we enjoy today came from those we thank. When we see time has always made discomforting patterns in all places before comfort is restored to know we have to accept discomfort when building a comfortable world. When we see a discomforting time where women are put in their place we expect them to abide by a men's place to not see if such places applys to any men why not fishmen?"
"658",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is an ingenious fantasy romance that utilizes cold war era elements to the advantage of its premise while subtly challenging our preconceived notions of established archetypes.Del Toro has an innate understanding of portraying beauty of purity in all it's forms while simultaneously showing us the grotesque underbelly and brutality of what it is to be human.These skills help him build a boy meets girl (or girl meets creature xP) fairytale with a believable yet dynamic supporting cast.The story is equal parts gripping as it is touching, overcoming it's formulaic approach by using unlikely characterization and story elements that come seamlessly together. Adding the films success to his repertoire definitely showcases Del Toro's ability to adapt and excel in multiple genres."
"659",5,"  I loved it, I simply did. Guillermo del Toro's latest feature has so much soul and heart that elevate this story to other levels. ""The Shape Of Water"" is an otherwordly experience and the movie that made me finally fall for del Toro's style. A very unique story,a very poetic story, a beautiul fairytale. So many themes hidden in this movie,so many subtle points were made. Sally Hawkins dazzled me with her performance, she was magnificent! All performances were exceptional but hers and Jenkins' brought so much soul to their characters. A really great movie!"
"660",1,"  Jesus H, that was the most bizarre film I think I've ever watched. It was like a mix between Amelie and Beauty and the Beast, which might be acceptable, at least, were it not for the fact that a) the beast looked like a mutant lizard fish out of predator, b) Amelie didn't have the good sense not to have intercourse with it, three times c) we were reliably informed by the lead actress (who had to use hand gestures because she couldn't speak) that the predator's 'funangulator' sprouted from behind its pelvic bone. Call me over imaginative, but a 'funangulator' sprouting from a space more commonly designated (in humans) for a female's 'trunundular' is surely never going to be pretty, heaven forbid 'sexy'?! If you can magnanimously put the beastiality that gradually blossoms between these two creatures to one side - which, call me old fashioned, never seemed to quite go away (but rather kept haemorrhaging, perhaps in syncopation with the beasts throbbing funangulator) - I don't think I can say I've ever watched a film that has moved me so violently back and fore between gripping humanity to such disturbing depravity so quickly within the space of two hours in my entire life. It was like experiencing life with a split personality disorder. I couldn't watch the grizzly bits either, but it was clearly a powerful movie and well acted. My only wish would be to see some of the outtakes of the actors describing the funangulator. It must have caused a few laughs; if not made them question whether anything in the film was 'right'? America concerns me sometimes. How did they even..? Ugh"
"661",0.5,"  Pornographic filth - poorly written and uninteresting."
"662",4.5,"  The Shape of Water basically has it all, a great story, stunning visuals, superb acting and a sweeping soundtrack. Furthermore, It's not that often that B stories are so well woven into the main plot and that every single set-up has a satisfying pay-off. To sum it up, Del Torro's vision applied to a modern day faery tale is a near perfect match."
"663",5,"  Best film Ive seen for ages, interesting, silly and just fun to watch, some critics are so full of their own importance they seem to forget about entertainment!"
"664",4.5,"  The love story between a non-human fish God and a mute human was seen and seen again over the past decades, but Del Toro has a unique way of telling a story and it's poetic.The choice of the actors is amazing and having a non-speaking first role practically reinvent the story telling.The image is amazing and I had a really good time watching this movie."
"665",5,"  Great! Inspiring movie about the power of love."
"666",2,"  The Shape Of Water is a derivative, uncomfortable, snoozefest with an overly gratuitous script and directing more worthy of a high school film student than someone as accomplished as Del Toro. Some of the cinematography is worth it and the score and sound editing are fabulous."
"667",2.5,"  While the film is somewhat entertaining, I kinda wince at how the value of transgression is reduced to whether a sea creature has a penis or not so that it/he can have intercourse with a human. It makes me miss something like Under the Skin more than ever. Of course, being del Toro film, The Shape of Water can't help but displaying one-dimensional characters. Its failure to dig deep into the theme of alienation is also much expected, given that the film is less interested in that, in comparison with drawing up some senseless fantasy for the audiences to wow at."
"668",5,"  Astonishingly beautiful. At its core, a somewhat familiar story, but told in an amazingly unique and touching way. A creature film that is truly a love story. Told in the simplest yet most profound terms possible. I find increasingly that Guillermo del Toro's work now surpasses what Tim Burton's work was for me in my youth (i.e. Edward Scissorhands). A great film."
"669",2.5,"  ...She had sex with a water monster! How is that not more disturbing and absurd with people? This utterly bizarre, really rather gross ""romance"" is probably going to win all the Oscars in the world, and I cannot for the life of me understand why. Gillermo Del Toro deserves an academy award. Absolutely. But while ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was a modern fairy tale masterpiece, this was just offsetting and creepy. Inter-species romance-I'm just not ready for it, I guess. Call me a prude, but the idea of a human actually mating with what is basically a space alien is NOT for me. But the performances were great. The cinematography, effects, lighting, costumes, sets and music were through the roof. From a technical standpoint, this film is a wonder. The actors have been rightly nominated for Oscars. For those reasons, I gave it 2.5/5 stars. But the plot was ABSURD. And the moment when a sea beast starts dancing on a '30s style bandstand is howlingly insane. I'll give it this: it was certainly memorable. And to be honest, perhaps that's enough these days. Creativity should be lauded, and this movie's going to win big at those all-important academy awards. Del Toro will be rightly recognized for his fantastic work. And so it goes."
"670",3.5,"  THE SHAPE OF WATER is a romantic fairy tale about an Amazonian River creature. The film is set during the Cold War of the early '60's with culturally attentive pragmatic attitudes and an excellent attention to detail. This film is not the fun-loving HELLBOY movies, nor the PAN'S LABYRINTH masterpiece; it is a piece of art and architecture all its own, and the production designers should receive as much credit as the director. The performances are convincing in every nuance. What this story reminds me of are stories from dolphin trainers who work with stressed dolphins that've spent too much time in captivity and need stress releases. While that comparison may sound bland, knowing characters' motivations for being in a relationship can make the relationship seem matter-of-fact; then comparatively, the neighbor's illustrations show the woman and creature's relationship as having a mythically romantic quality. It's interesting that Del Toro has the neighbor's illustrations to show that art may add romanticism to what are otherwise pragmatic and practical decisions just like this film's designs add a strangely romantic quality to the otherwise familiar story. In addition to the above, and not as an afterthought, this film is a tale of marginalized and misunderstood individuals who gain the strength from one another and from their differences to act against oppressive dominance. It's also a good reflection of how fear can create scary and violent people. Fear in the face of threats to one's values and family. While TIME magazine warns this has an interspecies sex scene, viewers who pay special attention to the mute woman's origin, having been found along a river, and scarification on the sides of her neck, along with the creature's peculiar abilities, may see the plot from a different point of view."
"671",5,"  Alittle slow but Excellent movie!"
"672",5,"  Me guato mucho la forma del agua por la historia,actuaciones,ambientaciones,etc muy buena pelicula"
"673",2.5,"  Very disappointed. I really dont know where is the charm in this film, everything is forced absurd and creepy."
"674",4.5,"  My favorite movie of 2017 and maybe the only I've seen multiple times in the theatre. Del Toro's visuals, the fantastic score and a fantastic performance delivered from Sally Hawkins without having her even utter a word all tie together into the strangest and most delightful cold war love story to ever exist."
"675",3,"  Just so-so, okay, nothing special by any means. Acting was very good, I like the visuals and the color of the film, it had some interesting themes and a nice mix of the sad and sweet, but ultimately I think the film was somewhat formulaic, been there done that, nothing much original. Overrated."
"676",5,"  Del Toro teki sen vihdoin... Nimittin viiden thden englanninkielisen elokuvan. Toimii kuin se kuuluisa junan vessa. Sally Hawkins on mahtava ja ansaitsee kaiken suitsutuksen. Sivurooleissa luottoporukkaa vaikka kuinka. ***** /5"
"677",4.5,"  Just amazes me. Only some parts do not make me fell into the story."
"678",3,"  Good movie but it could have been so much better"
"679",5,"  Guillermo del Toro logra darle forma de una manera magnfica a una historia que marc el cine, eligiendo con sublime excelencia cada uno de los detalles y argumento. Sin duda todo un poema y tributo."
"680",5,"  Sally Hawkins shines beginning to end. If you require characters to care about, you will find them in this film including the water bound male lead. Despite its watery environment, SofW sizzles hotter than some of its dryer counterparts. Yes, it is primarily a watery romance but friendship takes a strong second seat. This film gives you people to love as it portrays villians to hate, I will watch this again on DVD."
"681",1.5,"  Ridiculous movie about a mute who has sex with a lizard man in a flooded bathroom. Avoid at all costs."
"682",1.5,"  filmul devine mai interesant in actul 3, dar nu este convingator emotional. m-am plictisit pana la final."
"683",5,"  I would call it an impeccable reconstruction of The Beauty and the Beast, perfect soundtrack, I loved the photography, excellent performance by Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon."
"684",4,"  del Toro's latest dark fantasy boasts an excellent cast, orchestrated by a rhythmic feel from start to finish. Sally Hawkins perfectly exudes emotion, despite her character being mute. Her performance is backed by solid turns from Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Jenkins, and an impressively dark ambiance from Michael Shannon. A complex and moving score, as well as immersive production design make the fairytale more of a vintage love story with added flare. With the complexity of characters and style, ""The Shape of Water"" falls only slightly short of perfection with an underdeveloped storyline shared between the two leading lovers."
"685",3,"  In this unusual mesh of fantasy, romance and science fiction, a mute woman working as a lab custodian in the late 60s falls for an abused, captive sea monster. The film dons many hats, several at the same time, which distract and compete for attention: that central relationship, the military's plans for the creature, a neighbor's quest to reclaim his job with an ad agency, a coworker's marriage, a supervisor's frustrated home life. Each adds a layer to the onion skin, and color to the world, but ultimately they feel like light diversions from the main course. On a technical level, it's exceptional. Guillermo del Toro's work has never been short on conceptual know-how, and The Shape of Water merely continues his habit of one-upping the preceding film. The beast itself, heavily influenced by The Creature from the Black Lagoon with a hint or two of Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy, looks fantastic. Lifelike and expressive, it's easy to buy into as a thinking, feeling participant in the story. Sally Hawkins is wonderful as the human lead, drawing inspiration from dozens of classic silent films in her flourishing role as a mousey, passionate, eloquent young woman. Set designs, too, are distinct and remarkable, from the slimy, clinical confines of the military science lab to her crusty, crumbling apartment just above an active movie theater. The plot drags, though, and more than once edges awfully close to cliche. I enjoyed it, particularly on a thematic level, but I wish it was about twenty minutes shorter."
"686",5,"  This is a gorgeous movie. A luscious cinematic confection, with a thoroughly engaging and original story made even better by the beautiful performances it hosts. Richard Jenkins was a standout for me, giving a deep humanity and humor to what could have been a mere supporting role. The actors all gave tremendous credibility to this fantastic story, and worked so very well together as an ensemble. Beautifully directed and shot, it has to be seen to be believed. So glad I saw it on the big screen."
"687",3,"  Well acted and beautiful sets, but in the end it's just another very predictable ""Beauty and the Beast"" movie which has been done a hundred times."
"688",1.5,"  The Creature was having sex with the girl come on!!! I have no idea how the critics can think this was a great movie. The acting was good no issue their and the way it was filmed looked amazing but it was the movie itself that was bad. I understand the storyline about the girl who was kinda a little different cause she can't talk and she feels lonely see a creature who is being mistreated because he is different and misunderstood I understand .It started off okay not good but by the time the creature started having sex with the girl I couldn't help but to start shaking my head and start laughing. Also what was up with Giles trying to hit on the guy at the cafe.The director Guillermo del Toro took the whole idea from the creature from the black lagoon but put his own spin on it and took out the good parts of the movie and added a muted girl and a creature who can dance,heal people and even save life or two. They tired to save it at the end but when the girl all of a sudden grew gills like a fish just put the nail in the coffin. The critics need to be drug tested and hopefully a good director will see this be upset and get the rights to make the Creature from the black lagoon the way it was supposed to be. It will be a very long time before I go see a Guillermo del Toro movie. He's weird but not a good weird but an awful weird. I'm glad I only paid 6 dollars to see the movie!!!! even that was about 3 dollars to much."
"689",3,"  If the best a ""master storyteller"" can come up with is such a harsh drama peopled by all the current stereotypes in vogue, then we who love good stories are in trouble. What could have been a truly touching love story was marred by trite reruns of bigotry, meanness and sex in most of the characters. A disappointment."
"690",3.5,"  This film is a remarkably unique and powerful love story that has already become a classic. It was great to imagine what the creature might look down there but at the same time it all feels a little too cringeworthy. I appreciated the concept of water and the uninterrupted floating of the camera throughout the entire film. Congrats to Del Toro, still I wouldn't say this is worthy of Best Picture at the Academy Awards."
"691",5,"  Great movie, emotionally moving, action, discrimination and, in the end, redemption."
"692",3.5,"  I get the Oscar love, its a very well directed, beautiful movie. The cinematography, editing and music are impeccable. The Cold War Era theme is nailed. The story doesn't match up to the elements though."
"693",2,"  Not what I expected from the trailer. Unnecessary violence and gore. Weird story. Disappointing"
"694",5,"  Hauntingly beautiful, if quirky, love story. Loved, loved, loved it!"
"695",4,"  I love how this movie just goes all in, no half-measures."
"696",5,"  Beautiful movie, great work, visually stunning!!!"
"697",4,"  It was honestly quite odd. I think I walked away from it liking it overall though. It was a beautiful looking movie and the cinematography was very good, also the actresses and actors made the characters really come to life. Once again though, it was strange, definitely a monster movie."
"698",4,"  Great movie with lots of thrills right to the end of the movie. An Oscar for best picture."
"699",5,"  Del Toro bounces back after what others would call a weak film, Crimson Peak, I enjoyed that film. This film plays out like The Creature from the Black Lagoon but is much more beautiful and a labour of love by the director. The film balances a horror film but also a mystery and love that is not commonly shared in this day and age. I'm shocked Del Toro has never made a film at Universal as he has the scope and ambition to remake the Wolfman or Frankenstein something unique. I hope this wins big as it deserves all the focus it is receiving by audiences and critics. 08-02-2018."
"700",4,"  It pulls you back to a time with a time machine direction into a gritty, wet, cold war time that is so true it somehow brings the strange fictional ""monster"" legitimacy. Sally Hawkins and Micheal Shannon performances were Oscar worthy. How the director, Del Toto brings this plot to reality seems impossible, yet you are pulled into a reality you dont want to escape from.. One of the BEST films of the year!"
"701",3.5,"  The movie started so intriguingly. This new and unusual creature, in need of the help of a strong heroine. The antagonist is gritty and easy to hate, I appreciated all the casting. However some of the scenes seemed forced. Like morning masturbation seemed unnecessary, or the uncomfortable husband& wife scene, they were not poetic or brave; just gross. At other times the movie dragged, altogether Iwould have watched again, maybe with the remote close next time."
"702",1,"  Disconnected and awkward"
"703",5,"  What a visual masterpiece! Sally Hawkins was fantastic! The movie was intriguing and stunning, with pleasing music and a fairytale ending! Highly recommend!"
"704",5,"  Excellent film indeed. Stunning cinematography and a great story. A mix of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon, ""Splash"" and Beauty and the ""Beast"". The actors were quite excellent. It deserves the Academy Award nominations it has. Only one scene bothered me and that was the black and white dance scene. It interupted the film in terms of style and seemed unnecessary."
"705",0.5,"  like a dark comedy on all hollywood favorites. Just missing a car chase. I would not see this again."
"706",4,"  Great movie, very beautiful love story!"
"707",3,"  Sally Hawkins does a very good job of playing the lead and I really liked all the other characters but was not that crazy of the movie in general."
"708",2,"  A cross between Beauty and the Beast + E.T.Truly, this is a kid's storyline made ""adult"" by softcore porn and liberal violence. I'm reviewing this the this the next morning and feeling used. The plot is just a hash of downtrodden outcasts vs. Evil Establishment Males. I will say that the acting and computer effects were very good."
"709",3,"  The Shape of Water is, as I heard, the pontential oscar winner, but I have to admit that it seemed a little overrated in my eyes. I think that in this story there isn't anything so much original, touching, heartfelting, or unpredictable. I think that what distinguish this movie of other movies with similar stories is the fact that this story is carefully well-told, the photography is amazing too and it has an amazing powerfull unexpected musical number, but despite that I found the story so predictable and vulgar that I don't think it deserves the oscar of the best picture of the year."
"710",5,"  ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. The performances in this film are brilliant, with a unique female lead who cannot speak and must communicate with sign language.One of the things that works really well in this film is the way that it takes certain genres or certain norms in film and it will flip them upside down. For instance, Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with the ""asset"" or the Amphibian man (Doug Jones), the film takes a departure from the classic monster-romance film and Elisa is the one who makes a transformation into a ""monster"" or mermaid as the case may be. This up-ends our classical representation of a monster-romance such as ""Beauty And The Beast"" in which a beast is civilized by a woman. Another thing that is done so well that other films attempt but fail to succeed in is that it calls back to different styles of performing arts. The Gene Kelly-like dream sequence that covers a large portion in the ""second act"" if you can call it that, reminds us of the time of musical theater adaptations. This is done masterfully, while not startling an audience with a palate for action and thrills. The dream-sequence is completely in sync with the tone of the rest of the film. There are certainly many more great things about this film that I could go on writing for hours - but these were the highlights whichever stood out the most to me. Go see this movie, you won't regret it!"
"711",0.5,"  This movie contrasts too many ideas that conflict with one another. He's an animal, okay. No, wait, he's intelligent, so he's humanized. Okay. No, hold on, he ate a cat, and I can't hold him responsible because he's a wild animal after all. Wait, cancel that, he's still humanized enough for sex... Oh wait, GODLIKE. Because what this story really needed was ""I can heal myself-ex-machina"".There are just other movies that handle the concepts attempted to be explored here, such as in Amelie. It just feels like the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, evidenced by some characters becoming completely irrelevant by the end, and much of the story not being fleshed out in exchange for a badmy written romance (which is ruined as soon as the cat scene shows up).And I can't even give credit to the design of the creature, because there's like, 5 things already in fantasy that look way too similar for coincidence. Watch another movie, this one isn't worth it."
"712",3,"  Just could not get into the picture. I didn't care about any of the characters and the whole romance between it/him and Elisa was not believable . The picture was also very long"
"713",4,"  Solid movie. Excellent acting. Good plot."
"714",3,"  Liked the movie a lot but could not help wonder if the movie would be deserving of 13 Oscar nominations were it not for the political under tones (or were they that obvious?). All the schmucks were a left stereotyped Trumpster while all of the compassionate, loving people were a mute a black a gay and a creature who encompasses every other so-called oppressed. I'm so tired of Hollywood preachers."
"715",5,"  Del Toro revisits his Pans Labyrinth days and creates one of the most beautiful love stories ever told in cinematic history."
"716",5,"  Yeh, it is qwerky, but it is beautifully done. Definitely worth consideration for Best Picture."
"717",5,"  Sally Hawkins her usual great performance"
"718",5,"  I apologize if I'm saying too much-I normally can't stand this piss stain on the slacks of the internet website or the virtue signaling mockery it has made of movie critique. But I'm going to try my hardest nonetheless while I'm still overwhelmed with the film I just saw. I'm going to try to explain why I'm still crying after an hour after leaving the theater. The Shape of Water is perhaps one of the most perfect films ever made, at least to me. The kind in which you have a *need* to see even the credits to completion, and your feet don't work until you do. There was never a moment that felt out of place in this film--the performance by each and every actor in this film was perfection crafted by one of the most beautiful minds to have ever sat in a director's chair. I loved Elisa within two minutes of her initial presence on the screen--every moment in her daily routine revealing something about her character that words simply couldn't express. Even the scene where the actress appears completely naked serves a purpose: Elisa possesses a beauty that most people don't readily see. Her appearance is that of a reserved and timid young woman, but this scene shows us that she has features not unlike the most delicate of flowers. And later when she begins to form ties with her ""Romeo"", we see that this flower has an extremely strong stem. The performance between Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones makes you completely forget that you're seeing a mute woman have sex with a water monster-what you'll see instead is a relationship stripped away of misleading nature of words, and instead built by the subtle power of touch. I'm not sure what to say other than to congratulate every actor that brought this film to life and the crew that built it's world. Mr. del Toro, The Shape of Water is one of the greatest films I ever had the good fortune to see. Thank you for sharing it with me."
"719",3.5,"  A love story that actually makes perfect sense. Never sloppy, though a little predictable, but the music line-up, the vintage air, and the screenplay is monumental. It draws us all back to how perplexed and entangled love is, yet it is still our refuge. I didn't like the feel of relief in the end, but it was still heart-warming and the best romantic stories in decades."
"720",4,"  The Shape of Water is an elegant throwback to classic love story that will indeed captivate your heart from the tantalizing beginning to its bitter-sweet end."
"721",2,"  Very slow, predictable, and pretentious."
"722",1,"  Visually interesting but otherwise lacked depth. I didn't buy into any of it. Very confused as to why all of the award nominations."
"723",0.5,"  Ever sit with a dog petting him then he silently farts, then you smell something horrible. This is my comparison to this turd of a movie. Visually dark and dumb down perfect for the member's of the academy. Walked out after 45 minutes and was not alone."
"724",4,"  it's wild but like it. very romantic."
"725",5,"  The Shape Of Water is truly what it means to create a perfect film. It's a story that would work in no other medium. No other director could make this material seem plausible, let alone phenomenal. Every actor could not have been better cast, there isn't a frame of the film that could be removed or added that would make it better. This is what it means to be a great film, this is the kind of art we so rarely get to see but when we do it's truly magical and will never be forgotten."
"726",4,"  Guillermo del Toro dissolves ingredients of human horror, gothic romance, vintage cinema love and marginalised identities to concoct a most absorbing fairytale for troubled times echoing the silence of love."
"727",5,"  its a beautiful movie"
"728",4.5,"  A good movie and my respect to guillermo del Toro"
"729",0.5,"  Do you like fishsticks, do you like fishsticks in your mouth? Well this is the gist of the movie, a PETA mute falling in ""love"" and making horrible decisions."
"730",2.5,"  If this film is supposed to be a satirical comedy then I'd have to change my rating because it's great in that regard, but if it's intention is to be a serious, romantic drama well...it falls very very far of that. Great visuals typical of del Toro films, a strong performance from Sally Hawkins and a strong middle half are the only things this movie has to offer...oh and maybe some (unintentional) laughs."
"731",4,"  Beautiful visuals and strong characters, but I have high expectations for Guillermo so I expected a little more."
"732",3,"  Visually outstanding, but the script does not make you fall in love with the creature as Elisa did, nor make this love development appealing. Great acting though."
"733",5,"  One word: beautiful."
"734",3,"  I didn't love this movie. But it was okay I guess..."
"735",1,"  Just did not like it. Old stale story."
"736",2,"  Overhyped. Best looking stupid movie I've ever seen. If it were low budget it would be a fantastic comedy."
"737",3,"  Movie was interesting, and well acted, but It live up to the hype"
"738",5,"  A absolutely brilliant take on the 'what makes a monster, what makes a man' narrative."
"739",4,"  Life is but the shipwreck of our plans."
"740",0.5,"  As boring and vapid as boring and vapid can be. The van used to take the fish man could drive through the holes in the story. I disagree with other one star reviewers that it was visually appealing and well acted. The dark hues and interior scenes were depressing and anything but appealing. Hawkins overacted several times- though if she hadn't it wouldn't have mattered. I'm so grateful we walked out mid-way as apparently rather than getting better, it actually got worse. Will never trust the TM again."
"741",1,"  E.T. for adults. This movie was very predictabe. This movie could have been very good but when it became a romance, it just became stupid. Once again Hollywood is out of touch. Of course because it has a big name producer, the critics in general must go ga-ga over it. Save your money!"
"742",0.5,"  Dont see what the big hype was. ""Visually a masterpiece""? What?I was excited as i really liked pans labyrinth but this movie was weird, boring and really nothing special. I did not syphazize with neither the creature or the protagonist. Im not a fan of The fact i felt you were supposed to cheer this strange romance on.Prepping us for future bending of what society think its ok and acceptable perhaps.Also, The only one who was good in this movie was Octavia."
"743",4,"  A very unique movie. A mix of drama/romance/fantasy. Pretty good and worth seeing."
"744",0.5,"  This was awful. I wanted to try and watch all the Oscar nominees. I tried to like it but it was too stupid, moronic. I don't get what you say about this movie, the story or the actors. Just awful. We walked out"
"745",5,"  Brilliant, smart, visually impeccable, touching, sensible, emotional and amazing. The Shape of Water deserves all the praises and more, once again Guilhermo Del Toro create a marvelous narrative so sensible, dark and fantastic that make the audiences feel everything in it, the cast also delivers a impeccable work (Sally Hawkins deliver one of the best performances of the decade). A masterpiece. (5/5)"
"746",5,"  Excelent in all aspects"
"747",5,"  Brilliant. Stunning. Beautiful. Guillermo is a visionary genius.Some scenes feel as though you're actually under the water. In other scenes you feel as though your heart will burst with love and heartbreak. This is an unexpected, gorgeously orchestrated Romance with touches of humor peppered throughout.The story is so unlikely but you never question it. It just works beautifully. Although the relationship between the two main characters seems familiar the obvious fact that well, he's not human...makes it enthralling to watch. Michael Shannon's character in this movie was great even though he is the ""villain"" in the movie, I couldn't help but enjoy his character. He's a wonderful actor. And can we talk about Doug Jones!? Being able to portray such deep emotions through layers of makeup and prosthetics is a testament to his genius as an actor and Del Toro no doubt recognizes that. What a duo! Just amazing.This entire film was a joy and privilege to watch."
"748",3.5,"  I did not dislike watching this movie and I am glad that Guillermo del Toro made a movie that he loves completely. The Creature has a fantastic design and Sally Hawkins, Doug Jones, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer are great in their roles, The story being unflinchingly a love story, as well as the film not hiding from aspects like sex was bold and worked. But... how do I put this, Guillermo very much genuinely loves movies and not just Hollywood movies that celebrate the golden era and Los Angeles - but Monster films and actually good movies. Yet it's terribly obvious why this movie got 13 Oscar nods as it's elements definitely will get the Academy's socks off on how much it celebrates movies and actors and that thing. When I would have preferred that that wasn't done, if that's what it had to do for the Academy to finally recognize Guillermo del Toro for the fantastic storyteller that he is, I guess it's a necessary sacrifice. Though this brings up negative feelings - the entire Academy and critic culture needs to fall down a hole - I would say the movie is still good regardless. Maybe though some aspects didn't deserve Oscar nods - like Richard Jenkins as best supporting actor? He wasn't bad but like... 2017 had many more supporting actors more worthy of that, amongst other things. It's not a bad movie, good, but great would be a stretch. The movie does have the best big lipped aligator moment though that might be my favorite scene. You'll know it when you see it and despite how ridiculous it is, despite how it's clearly giving the Oscars and Academy and Hollywood a handjob, it works because of the good writing of the film that makes a love story between a freaky fish guy and a mute woman work."
"749",4.5,"  This film lives up to its hype. It fits well with the popular theme of what it means to be human, but does this in a unique way as compared to others, like the resurgence of Blade Runner. Not only is this film aesthetically beautiful, the writing is incredible and Sally Hawkins' performance is compelling. A must see"
"750",5,"  This movie captures a spark that brings you into this world. It's a fairy tale like none before. Guillermo del Torros's directing is so creative that it makes you believe that the creature is a real person and not a monster. Though she barley speaks Sally Hawkins' makes you fell for her character and root for them survive."
"751",5,"  It's a very good movie directed by a genius director!!!! they explained so well the history that everybody can understand all the scenes!!!!!!"
"752",4,"  Es una pelcula bella y extraa, como suelen ser los productos de Guillermo del Toro, mi nica pega es esa cercana visual de su bestia, al Abe Sapiens del universo de Hellboy, del que sin duda tom inspiracin. Un romance inusual y un final esperado, incluso, predecible, aunque ello no afectara mi disfrute de la pelcula."
"753",3,"  I just don't get it!"
"754",1,"  If you've seen free willy you pretty much seen this movie as well. Except with some very odd sex scenes.Very disappointed I wasted my money on this."
"755",5,"  Saw ""The Shape of Water"" tonight. It is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It is exquisite. The story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" retold, with shades of ""Sleeping Beauty."" Wonderful symbolism with water as the leitmotif of rebirth and new beginnings. Winter into spring=Separation leading into rebirth. Fantastic Realism, fantasy and realism blending together until the line between them disappears. The story comes full circle. She as found as a child beside a river. The scars on her neck turn to gills. . . ."
"756",1,"  I will neither get back my money nor the two hours I wasted on watching this movie. Little to nothing was done to humanize the creature which essentially makes the romantic and sexual aspects of this movie beastiality"
"757",2.5,"  Guillermo Del Toro's entry to this years Oscar is a fantasy romantic drama set in 1960. It is more like a fairy tale like beauty & the beast. Sally Hawkins as Elisa has done well. But I felt the story did not have substance to support it. Not Del Toro's finest."
"758",4.5,"  Beautifully shot, acted and directed, The Shape of Water is an ethereal beauty, a marvel of filmmaking. Sally Hawkins shines in leading a talented cast that includes the always-wonderful Richard Jenkins (appropriately nominated for Best Supporting Actor) and Michael Shannon. Interestingly enough, Octavia Spencer, nominated for an Oscar in the Supporting Actress category, might have been the least impressive thing in the film. Nominated for 13-Oscars, this one is going to get some hardware. Another one destined to make the Top 10 list. 4.5/5."
"759",0.5,"  No, yes I get the artsy stuff once in a while but this is just not it"
"760",4,"  Loved it although it was slow to start."
"761",2,"  Ridiculous chick flick version of splash. Spoiler alert its the same movie down to the escaping from scientists and government to live happily ever after under the sea but in a dark unfunny way. Ultimately it failed to make the romantic connection required to risk ones life. A few eggs and some music does not mean love."
"762",4.5,"  Del Toro has a distinct ability to pull off magical realism, and the mastery is matched here with fantastic performance of all leading roles, making a niche subject enjoyable to a broad audience."
"763",5,"  Guillermo del Toro is back!!! and not to mention has crafted out another if not the.. most accomplished and outstanding effort of his career, this film may as well deserve to be called his 'Magnum Opus'. In saying that, the film itself is a mix of a surrealistic fantasy underlined by it's cold war America setting and political context, while at the same time it's an unlikely and uncanny romance that works so well, I can't help but think ""it's like nothing I've ever seen before"", unparalleled and unprecedented in any shape or form (unintended pun XD). While the story is almost a lot more character driven than plot from Sally Hawkins' outstanding performance (high hopes to win gold), del Toro never loses focus on any of the film's characters whose conflict's as well as their developments are just as compelling as the overarching plotting of the film. Even as outstanding as the film is to experience from it's story and characters, it's visual palette is every bit as outstanding as del Toro's direction dictates and the flawless editing and flow of the film's construction alone. Not one moment was I bored throughout the entire run-time of this film, I can't recommend it highly enough for what it's worth and that is; 'every minute of your time and every cent of your money you may pay to see this film, it's an instant classic for the ages and not just for Guillermo del Toro alone."
"764",5,"  In an age of Marvel and Fast and the Furious it's just oh so refreshing to come across a piece of film that is actually art as well. The Shape of Water is by no means a perfect film, regardless of it's Oscar nominations. In fact, at it's core it's a very excellent retelling of Beauty & The Beast. In film, and life, it's never about the destination. The journey is the story. This story has a journey. One that will keep you interested and wondering and maybe even spark some inspiration deep inside you that you never knew you had. This is a story of humanity and love and maybe moreover, who exactly gets to define what either of those things are.I haven't seen all of the Best Picture noms, but I have changed my mind from Three Billboards to Shape. Three is more than deserving. The story and performances are stellar and deserved of recognition. Sally Hawkins however, steals the show. He performance as a meek, caring, loving mute is simply masterful. The emotion expressed in her face and through every sign (sign language) can be felt by the audience. She seems to transcend what it means to connect with a character when all you can do is feel what they feel instead of simply agreeing or disagreeing.If Shape ends up taking Best Picture, I will not be disappointed. If any of you out there are on the fence about seeing this film, remember that it is a beautiful love story and not an action movie about a fishman. Don't watch trailers and immerse yourself in the world Del Toro creates. You will not be disappointed.tl;dr - A stellar film with high caliber performances. Don't miss the best film of the year. With competition like this, that's saying a lot."
"765",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is the latest film from Guillermo del Toro and it certainly delivered. It's well shot and well acted, with great acting from Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon. Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg and Octavia Spencer were pretty good in their roles as well. The ending isn't what I wanted, but the story is still quite engaging."
"766",0.5,"  I did not like this film."
"767",0.5,"  One of the worste movie I've ever seen. Please dont go, it's just bad in every way. The st"
"768",4,"  I'm happy to have seen this. Its not perfect, but considering how unique it feels it was thoroughly worth the time to watch."
"769",2.5,"  Showing outsider stories does not justifies a high rating."
"770",5,"  Visually wonderful and beautiful. Some scenes you would swear that your actually underwater but special effects comes through. I know some scenes like the bathroom scene, that was actually filmed underwater. Being Guillermo Del Toro, you would think that it's more of a sci-fi movie than anything else, but this is a straight up Romance Drama film with a good sense of humor. I was laughing out loud at times in the theater.I really liked the story, even though it felt like the relationship between the two main characters seems familiar. Very interesting premise and I loved Michael Shannon's character in this movie. He played it to a tee. Even though he is the supposed villain in the movie, I couldn't help but really grow attached to his character. He's a wonderful actor.The beginning scene was amazing to watch. I felt like I was back in Rapture, the main city in the game Bioshock. I really wish he'd gone down that more Bioshock aesthetic but the look of it in the movie was really nice either way.Overall, really good movie with some really good ideas, acting, and a great story."
"771",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro has made his richest film yet with an absorbing story, visually masterful, a stellar performance from Sallie Hawkins, and an equally emotional experience. A+"
"772",4.5,"  The Shape of Water  visualmente fabuloso e esteticamente luxuoso, alm de ser uma das histrias de amor mais belas do cinema."
"773",5,"  I loved this movie! The characters, the wonderful ones and the disgusting government characters were all worth spending this time with getting to know them. The story was absolutely enthralling."
"774",3,"  Although I do not think this was the best movie of the year, it's a good mix of Si-Fi and Romance."
"775",4,"  Granted I watched this movie in my second language, I really enjoyed it! Classic Guillermo feel and a story to make the audience feel, albeit it was a bit long."
"776",3.5,"  Nice film. No brain cells required. It's simply a more fervent take on the Beauty-and-The-Best theme. Great creature!"
"777",2,"  I went into this movie with very high hopes, but... I really didn't enjoy it, sadly. The cinematography is beautiful and the effects are great, but the story and characters (other than Michael Shannon's) are just kind of dull. The choices made in the film are very odd and what could have been an interesting and possibly touching love story between outcasts is overshadowed by gratutitous nudity and sex scenes that seem out of place, sudden gore in an attempt to shock, and lack of any meaningful development between the two lovers. Although the time period is mildy fitting, it also seemed plagued by the typical ""White / Christian men are all evil, dumb, sexist and racist (or some combo thereof) and minorities, gays, people with disabilities and freaks of nature are all opressed but generally good-hearted and kind. Yeah... so, what else is new in Hollywood?"
"778",0.5,"  Like, really awful. Really, really bad. I can't believe it has this many good reviews. Weird, cross-species sex is the only redeemable factor ;)"
"779",4,"  Guillermo del Toro has found himself to be quite the respected filmmaker over the years but, if I had to be brutally honest, I'd have to say that he's really only made a few films that could be classed as 'great' and he's not adverse to being disappointing on occasion. His latest films, Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim received a very mixed reception with the latter, in particular, being a huge misfire for me. That said, I do admire the man's imagination and I keep returning, hoping to see something of the greatness of Cronos, The Devil's Backbone and most importantly his near masterpiece of fantasy, Pan's Labyrinth. His latest, The Shape of Water doesn't quite hit the heights of the latter but that still doesn't stop in from being del Toro's best film for quite some time.Plot: Working in a hidden, high-security government laboratory, mute cleaner Elisa (Sally Hawkins) stumbles across a secret, unknown amphibian creature (Doug Jones) which is overseen by agent Strickland (Michael Shannon). Not before long, she develops an emotional attachment to this classified experiment that the government see as an ""asset"". As their relationship develops, Elisa is forced take matters into her own hands which is seen as threat to national security. The thing that's sets del Toro's fantasies apart from the rest is his ability to mesh then with other genres while also injecting a realistic element to them. The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth benefited greatly from their political undercurrent while also tapping into horror and folklore, respectively. The Shape of Water feels very much in tune with them and on this occasion he taps into the Cold War paranoia of America while also recognising the psyche that plagued the country during the secrecy of the Roswell incident and pays homage to the old Hollywood monster movies of yesteryear.There's a lot of care and attention went into this; from Nigel Churcher's rich art direction and Dan Lausten's beautifully rendered cinematography which compliment del Toro's vision and evocation of 1960's Americana. It's the kind of meticulous attention to detail that Todd Haynes would be proud of. But again, it's del Toro's ability to create his own niche by giving the film a very European flavour where I was reminded, on quite a few occasions, of Jean-Pierre Juenet's Amelie which is achieved through the magical score by Alexandre Desplat. It boasts a marvellous central performance from Sally Hawkins who's entirely convincing as a mute where she's so animated and expressive that it's easy to forget that she doesn't actually speak a word (with the exception of singing a musical number) throughout the entire film. Great support too from the imposing and always reliable Michael Shannon and the hugely underrated Richard Jenkins. Jenkins, in particular, brings a much needed light-heartedness to the film and despite being better known for his dramatic chops it's often overlooked just how good his comedic timing is. Here, it's on wonderfully subtle display. On paper, The Shape of Water probably sounds preposterous but visually and emotionally it's a vibrant experience that manages to be sweet, suspenseful and exciting all in equal measure. Put simply, this really shouldn't work but it's credit to del Toro that it does. He masterfully balances all of these elements and combines a romantic love story and sci-fi creature fable into a very convincing adventure.Mark Walker"
"780",0.5,"  Thank you Hollywood for once again 'Hollywood-splaining' me the things I should have always known: 1 Military is always evil2. America is always evil3. People who believe in God are always evil4. White heterosexual men are always evil, (and only Caucasians with vices, who are gay or who are immigrants are good.)Of course, it had those ""positive"" messages for me too which I am forever grateful for:5. Minorites are always good6..Perversion is always good 7. SJW's are always goodWhat would I ever do without Hollywood teaching me ethics and morals to live by?"
"781",5,"  A poesia cruel de Del Toro encanta muito.The Shape of Water mistura todos os mais clssicos e competentes temas do cinema moderno em uma homenagem aos grandes filmes da era Noir, com sua pitada fantasiosa que  um prazer aos olhos.Sally Hawkins apresenta uma personagem encantadora em todos os sentidos, fazendo-se um exato meio termo entre a doura e egosmo, que ajuda a humanizar mais ainda a brilhante criatura aqui vivida por Doug Jones.The Shape of Water rene tantas glrias em duas apertadas horas que precisa de um texto para cada frame.Uma obra de arte."
"782",3.5,"  The Creature of The Black Lagoon part 3. It was interesting and compelling...Did I enjoy it? I don't know. It was obsurd of course but I don't know...that's my answer."
"783",0.5,"  I do not support bestiality, sorry not sorry."
"784",0.5,"  Not a good movie. Not a good story.I found the movie pointless. The story was boring. Above all the film did not effectively sell or explain their intended message. I'm sure this movie is about finding loveand being loved and how love often cannot be explained or can. E unconventional. However, this film shows a clearly psychologicaly flawed woman that falls ""in love"" with an "" intelligent"" see creature that at best would be described as seriously mentally handicapped if it were human. The film depicts the creature as fairly clueless to any deep thoughts beyond physical urges and child like. The film never shows why she loves it other than the fact he is rejected and flawed like her. Again the heroine is clearly psychologically damaged demonstrated by this and the fact that she can intermittently speak or squeak suggesting a psychological barrier to her mutism than a physical barrier. To summarizeA crazy lady has sex w a mentally disabled fish so she can feel better about herself. I just saved you 2 + hours of misery"
"785",4,"  A tremendous, beautifully well-acted drama, with magic and mystery. Sally Hawkins is stunning, in particular, but the entire cast is awe-inspiring. The story has some challenges, and could have been stronger, but this is still one of Guillermo del Toro's best works to date."
"786",5,"  More like Beauty and the Beast, but much more than just a fairy tale. The movie carries an educational theme about the imperfect. ""Why?"" and ""How?"" are the questions that always on the top of people's tongue when it comes to the way that ""different"" or ""unique"" individuals ""interact"". People often think that these individuals are incapable of finding ""joy"". The Shape of Water reminds us that they absolutely can, that they are just the same as everyone else. ""God, he's not even a human!"" (G.)""If we do nothing, neither are we."" (E.)"
"787",4,"  Within the first five minutes of The Shape of Water, Sally Hawkins' mute maid Eliza sets a timer, hops in the bath, and masturbates. The film has been marketed as an adult fairy tale, and the first part of the statement can't be ignored. Don't get me wrong; this isn't a raunch-fest about fish-sex. But unlike Pan's Labyrinth, which was an adult fairy tale from a child's perspective, The Shape of Water is distinctly mature through-and-through, a brutally violent, quietly introspective, and lusciously gorgeous delight. It also happens to feature a sexy fish-man.Even if said sexy fish-man doesn't work for you, there's no denying how stunningly beautiful this film is, with oversaturated blues giving Eliza's apartment the feeling of an aquarium and neon greens (or is that teal?) frequently blanketing the players. In many fantastic ways, the art design evokes Bioshock's Rapture, particularly when combined with its cold-war setting and record-box soundtrack. In a touch that could be viewed as cheap if I had a heart of stone, Eliza lives above a cinema, and The Shape of Water definitely earns the La La Land/The Artist movie-about-how-great-movies-are slot at the Oscars. But it does so in little ways, such as Eliza and her neighbour Giles performing a small couch dance routine, before paying it off in a big, spectacular moment.The bloody violence might turn some off, and indeed ventures into fairly rough territory at times. Michael Shannon brings a lot of intensity to a fairly one-note heel, finding new dimensions of depravity in every act. One could also fault Del Toro for spending too much time with his side characters, but he paints Giles, Dmitri, and Zelda with a fine enough brush that I wouldn't want to see them excised even if the occasionally feel extraneous. But the heart lies within Eliza and The Creature, whose sensitive puppy-dog attitude never feels manipulative. If this kind of fantastical twist is what movie romance needs, I for one welcome our new sexy fish-man overlords."
"788",3,"  While visually beautiful and unique. perhaps my own excitement for this film made it fall a bit flat. I expected a nuanced love story, and that relationship was the least developed of all. I wish they had spent more time on the love story, and less on developing the other supporting characters. Elisa's relationship with her neighbor, Giles, played by Richard Jenkins, was far more compelling than the one with her creature."
"789",5,"  A truly magical experience, the Shape of Water is likeable and exciting at every turn. All of the characters are believable and fun to watch, and you understand each characters motivation clearly. There is CGI, but it serves only to enhance the experience and makes things more believable rather than fake-looking. Amazing film, one of my favourites I've seen this year."
"790",1.5,"  I went to see this film, expecting to love it. How could any film with Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins be bad? But, I found it hard to sit through the whole movie, filled with scenes of unnecessary gore and brutality (I even had to shut my eyes for a few seconds in one scene, something as a hardened cinephile I haven't done for decades) because I just didn't want to soak in the gore I knew was coming. Scenes of masturbation in a bathtub, torture (of animals? Or a god? And of a mortally wounded man), oozing wounds, and the ecstatic consuming of junk food.... all distracted from the very thin story. And for all the ASL used by the main character, hearing all her friends recite vocally what she was signing was RIDICULOUS, like much of the rest of the movie. Ignore all the Oscar buzz, and go see ""Paddington 2"" for a good time."
"791",1,"  A sad remake of an old swamp thing movie. We would not watch again on TV for free"
"792",4,"  Beautiful, bold and brave. GDT's best in years!"
"793",3.5,"  An interesting modern fairy tale spun by Guillermo del Toro of the lovers and the jealous monster. Michael Shannon always a good villain and Sally Hawkins was a nice surprise as the mute protagonist."
"794",3.5,"  An enjoyable movie but nothing special. As good as it looks it's all pretty heavy handed stuff. Not even close to the best film of 2017/18."
"795",3.5,"  I love Del Toro's work, with Pan's Labrynth my favourite movie of his, so I had high hopes. However, it was slightly disappointing, even if this could be down to my high expectations. Sally Hawkins is great, despite playing a mute and using no words, and the the design of the ""aquaman"" has clearly been crafted with care. The storyline is one we have seen many times before though, even if there is a lot of charm surrounding it. Three Billboards outside Ebbing is a better film though in my opinion."
"796",5,"  Guillermo will win the oscar this year! And he deserves it. About time monsters got a little respect out there."
"797",0.5,"  The movie had a brilliant idea, bringing an unknown intelligent creature from under the depths of lakes and swamps and oceans but aside from that it didn't have anything going for it. It is like a poorly written fanfiction created by a 14 year old girl who over sexualizes things and mistakes it as good writing. I'm not one against nudity and sexuality in films but in this work the story could have advanced just as well, if not better, without it. 0.3/10 is my rating... Very disappointed."
"798",1,"  Don't wasre your time or money. Garbage is all I can say about this movie."
"799",5,"  Since Disney took Tim Burton from us, Del Toro fills that void for us just like the creature did for the girl in this movie."
"800",1,"  Horrible. It was like taking the 1954 B film classic, ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and trying to make it into a raunchy, vulgar joke of a film. The movie opens with Sally Hawkins nude in a bathtub masturbating. Then Sally and Octavia get to watch the security guard pee in the bathroom. Then the guard who gets two fingers bitten off by the hokey ""creature"" sees his kids off to school then we get to watch him hump his wife in bed. The narrative was classy too, such as ""You know corn flakes were invented to reduce masturbation."" And, ""as long as you have a finger left to put in her vagina."" The thing is, none of this narrative or vulgar scenes had ANYTHING to do with the plot. I'm not a prude and have nothing against a meaningful love scene pertinent to the plot (such as Leonardo and Kate's love scene in the Titanic) but this movie was nothing but inane vulgar trash."
"801",5,"  Wonderful. Engrossing. Clever and Satisfying."
"802",5,"  Absolutely loved it from the first moment. Every moment and every image seemed perfectly placed."
"803",1.5,"  I am really at a loss... how did this do better than The Greatest Showman which is, by far, a movie with a superior story? There's nothing relatable about a woman having sex with a fish. I think people are just claiming to like it because they want to seem artsy and cool... I saw the shape of water right after I saw the greatest showman and was actually offended that it was nominated for 7 Golden Globes. I really need someone to help me out here. Maybe I'm just too clueless to understand..."
"804",5,"  I went to this movie expecting to really dislike it. The story just seemed too bizarre. So glad I went. Yes...the plot is bizarre, there are so many things that I thought were great. I've now seen all but one of the best picture nominees for this year....and without a doubt, this would be the one I would vote for."
"805",0.5,"  liberal garbage. The cast is a Democratic party coalition-of-the-fringes against a generic evil white man. Generic evil white man prevents alien ""other"" from screwing a white woman. Democratic party coalition-of-the-fringes gangs up on evil white man to save the day for miscegenation. That is literally what this movie is about, pure political propaganda."
"806",4,"  While a love story between a sea creature and a woman may be a little far fetched, ultimately this is a story about loneliness, our need for human connection, and the lengths we will go to find it."
"807",2,"  A new spin on Beauty & the Beast? Or just 2 hours of inter-species sex?"
"808",0.5,"  Formulic. Written as if a committee or director set down and said ""Let's check all the boxes to get the Best Pic Oscar,"" in fact, some scenes seem to be direct re-creations of scenes from past Oscar Best pic nominated films La La Land and Avatar . Without giving offense to those with special abilities, of which I am included, in an effort to be a message film on the theme of speech issues, it perpetuates homophobic stereotypes that older gay men being lonely, dysfunctional and predatory."
"809",5,"  Un deleite visual, una obra maestra en toda la extension de la palabra, decir que tuve la oportunidad de estar completamente solo en la sala de cine y ver una pieza como esta, es indescriptible! Me deje llevar con el mundo de del Toro y este me atrapo. Una metafora sobre el amor en el ser sin importar cual sea, que se mezcla con los tiempos violentos y la mitica tragedia griega, haciendo de The Shape Of Water la poesia perfecta."
"810",4,"  Beauty and the Beast for adults. The music leads the film to a place of magic and peace. In love."
"811",3,"  Fairy tales attract us because of their symbolic simplicity: they exist in world of archetypes, in this case it's Beauty and the Beast. But that simplicity can easily stray into thinness. Del Toro makes great efforts to mask this with wondrously rich production design (a 40's - 50's world of deco wallpapers, green ceramic, linoleum and chrome has rarely looked so solid and the lighting is phantasmagoric) and by surrounding his central romance with a variety of skilled character actors (Jenkins is gently sublime as ever, with Spencer and Stulbarg lending kindly support,) but the story is simple to the point of non-existence. Hawkins acts like a ballerina but her marine lover is too much a thing of rubber fins and expressionless digital eyes to ever register any real emotion, leaving the burden of transmitting the relationship entirely to the heroine. And, adult as the film may be with its gunshot wounds and nods towards sexual assault, homophobia, racism and torture, any child knows that fish don't have penises. Shannon does excellently in the role of the implacable, self-loathing pursuer, so familiar from so many Disney cartoons. In the end, this has no more substance than any animation from the Magical Kingdom. Even on Del Toro's own terms, this doesn't come close to threatening 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'The Devil's Backbone.' It's too weightlessly neat, a child's toy wrapped in grown-up paper."
"812",2.5,"  The Shape of Water is visually interesting but the movie falls flat emotionally. I'm glad I saw it but I wouldn't recommend it. I found the characters to be somewhat annoying and I wasn't really invested. It was a bit disappointing considering it has received such great reviews. See if you have nothing else to do ..... otherwise skip it."
"813",3,"  Well acted and well produced but the story is agonizingly slow. This provides a lot of artistic and creative value, but it does take away some normal viewer interest."
"814",0.5,"  I went to see this movie because I typically enjoy movies that have gotten multiple awards nominations. I went into it with an open mind, but as the plot went on the movie just got so utterly ridiculous and at parts laughably bad. Do not waste your time or money going to see this ridiculous garbage."
"815",0.5,"  Terrible script... Unrealistic in many parts"
"816",3,"  Too many subplots and minor characters get in the way of keeping one riveted. Could have used a firmer hand in the editing bay."
"817",0.5,"  Boy was this movie over-rated. I just could not buy into the storyline."
"818",5,"  An enchanting visual masterpiece. The Shape of Water challenges your notions of human empathy and shirks the norms of a tired Hollywood with its daring and unapologetic dive into an exploration of human fantasy, love and repression. Sally and Richard's onscreen performance is unnervingly convincing to the point that it hurts to think that they are acting their characters and not exposing their secret reality. The only true pain, however, in seeing the movie was coming to realize how predictable the plot is. Major plot points begin to unravel long after it is obvious what must happen for the story to advance. An unfortunate lack of surprise. With that said, this can stand on its own just as a work of art if not even a film but it makes a stellar film even where it needs not to."
"819",5,"  I thought this was such a lovely movie.... I could not disagree more with the negative ratings here... see it and you will agree that it is a remarkable film."
"820",0.5,"  Not getting what all the awards are all about. Simplistic, silly and not scary, tries too hard and all characters are cardboard cutouts. Disappointing. H"
"821",5,"  Guillermo del Toro's crowning achievement. A lush, thoughtful tribute to the films of yesterday."
"822",4,"  So how should I put this, The Shape of Water is extremely hard to explain not due intercity of its story but the overwhelming emotions that can not be explained, it can only be felt, the story itself is profoundly moving and touching, although I find myself obligated to admit that I wasn't that amazed by it but I believe it had something special from its beautiful cinematography to the simplistic yet convincing acting by Shannon and especially Hawkins who manged to render a moving performance without saying a single word yet it was so gripping, Desplate's music was so magical and enchanting and it gives the film a charming vibe to it, and now for the directing, Del Toro spared us none of his talents and it is obvious to see, although it wasn't as powerful as I wanted it to be but I believe he manged to put on a good effort that is certainly worth parsing despite the fact that it could have been much better, I won't label it as amazing but I certainly think it's good."
"823",4,"  Creative, fantastic, emotional and pure"
"824",5,"  Phenomenal movie-wasn't even interested in seeing it. So glad I did!"
"825",4.5,"  Gorgeous to look at. Amazing storyline. Great film about a girl who falls in love with a fish and you actually believe it! Guillermo is breaking barriers for all the horror and monster genres!"
"826",3,"  Beautifully filmed and directed. Certainly an Oscar or two will come from this one."
"827",2.5,"  Very disappointing. Zero character develpoment, cartoonish 1-dimensional characters worthy of Baz Luhrman. A pretentious arty B movie."
"828",4,"  Beautiful message that is sent during this bravely directed Del toro's film. Great acting but it doesn't truly dives into character that much and maybe that is a good thing, it focuses con giving you a glimpse of each character that at the end makes for tight story. Loved the colors of this film. Other than lovely I try hard to find other words to describe the film without much coming to mind."
"829",1,"  It is very sad that the film industry considers this a great film That says a lot about the current quality of movies.There is very little out there really worth seeing! In our opinion, this film is silly and idiotic. It also includes gratuitous violence toward the end. I read Rex Reeds review and totally agree with him. At least there is a movie critic that tells it like it is and is not fooled by ""the emperors new clothes."","
"830",5,"  I was taken aback at every 5 minutes. Got in the movie theater thinking I was going to watch just a far-fetched sci-fi love story. but how wrong i wasWhat most struck me was the breaking of every possible paradigm in main stream plots , tearing apart our socially constructed ideas of what the ""good guy"" should do or be like. All characters are rebellious here, all trying to fight back against the system. The outcasts of society all thriving to survive. It also, underneath, depicts an old America secluded in racism and prejudice.."
"831",1,"  Walked out cinema after 30 minutes. Not sure what all the critics see in it"
"832",5,"  Excellent human-humanoid love story with extra credit to Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer."
"833",3,"  An idolization of 1960s nostalgia and little else. The movie makes frequent detours to show classic cars, musical films on old TVs, blinking theater lights, hand-painted ads, old house construction, diners, etc. There's a good dose of artistic symbolism forced in too. People in the movie seem out of place and there's almost no story at all. It's fun to watch, but at the same time so frustrating that it could have been much better."
"834",3.5,"  Would have been a great love story but as always Hollywood has to put gratuitous sex, nudity and violence in almost every scene. The backdrop is very La La Land and this outstanding plot is ruined at almost every turn. The bad guy is so very very bad that not one scene that he is in occurs without some type of disgusting behavior to just drive that home. Many aspects of this film were just overdone and insulting to the viewers who, despite what Hollywood thinks, are intelligent enough to get it without being beaten over the head with it."
"835",0.5,"  Saw it. Wasn't impressed at all. Unneeded nudity and an unbelievable love story. Vastly overrated. Del Toro's depiction of the straight white male antagonist is typical Hollywood. Of course he's racist, of course he cheats on his wife, of course he's a bully. Apparently Hollywood's idea of diversity nowadays is more about bashing one segment of the population in order to appeal to the others. This is the last film I see by this overrated director. Clearly this 92% rating is fixed. This site is losing it's credibility."
"836",0.5,"  Horrific waste of time. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Children are starving yet millions were wasted on this film. The only fascinating thing about the film was right when you thought it couldn't get worse it would prove you wrong!"
"837",0.5,"  SJW TRASH CONTENT WARNING!!!"
"838",1,"  Truly terrible. Fine acting cannot salvage a story with no sympathetic characters."
"839",5,"   um timo filme, com uma das melhores atuaes de Sally Hawkins e uma direo de arte de cair o queixo com uma fotografia explendida"
"840",2,"  Do NOT go to this movie. I have heard ""this is such a beautiful movie"". What??? It was interesting visually, but the full frontal nudity early on was off-putting. And the story line? I begged my husband to take me to this movie - he wanted something else, and half-way through I turned to him and apologized.Stupid movie but the critics love it!"
"841",0.5,"  It sucks. Full of contradictions. Meaningless. No suspense. The events are totally expected."
"842",4,"  Interesting with a lot of different emotional connections."
"843",3.5,"  Beautiful, poetic, and romantic. Plus a fantastic and scary monster! The set design, lighting and colors are beautiful as well. Great acting all around. If you are a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, even suspense you get this here. A movie well worth seeing."
"844",5,"  I cried at the end. Beautiful film."
"845",3,"  It's kind of like E.T., if E.T. had had sex with a human. I guess it checks all the right boxes for an Academy Award nominated film but it really wasn't my cup of tea."
"846",3,"  Beautiful film...with a less compelling story. The acting is superb and the effects are great, but the story is not as strong as many are saying. There are better films this year"
"847",5,"  This movie touchs me when I need it most."
"848",0.5,"  I so desperately wanted to find relevance in this movie. When a quirky movie comes out that the academy goes nuts over, I feel like I'm missing something. But no, this movie was an obnoxious fairy tale about a girl who loves a buggy critter and doesn't appreciate her friend helping her hide the critter so she doesn't even apologize for flooding his apartment."
"849",4,"  es muy buena, casi perfecta...pero ese pequeo gran detalle le quita una estrella al menos para mi."
"850",4,"  I'm going to say this right away. This Movie moves very slowly but that does not stop it from being very good and enjoyable. The feel seems spot on for the period of time and the acting is suburb. It is not a prequel to his hellboy which fans think and that is because they made merman look too much like Abe. That's my one beef. They really needed to make him look different then they did so people do not try to make that connection."
"851",1,"  Not deserving that Oscar"
"852",3.5,"  excellent film about a cleaning lady falling in love with a fish. it is a very well directed film though if it came out 20 years ago than I doubt that it would be up for ""best picture"" its a simple fact that modern movies simply forgot how to do characterization or properly pace a film. the only overtly bad part of this film is how Del Toro wrote the Micheal Shannon character...he lays it on a little too thick really. Fine acting though, just a one dimensional villain.if you want a weird love story than this is worth checking out."
"853",5,"  A wonderfully simple and unique story in the whimsical but dark style that Guillermo del Toro excels at. Wonderful movie."
"854",1,"  Really lazy movie. The characters are shallow, there's at least 2 characters (the spy and the cake guy) who just make me feel like I wasted my time watching them. The fish dude is just mediocre at best, and the main character is easily the most cliche kind of woman in a ""romantic"" scenario. The plot is really weak and when you think it'll get better it just stops, the bad guys are pictured as pure evil, without any motivation aside from beeing total jerks. THERE'S A FUCKING STUPID DANCE MUSICAL WITH NO REASON AT ALL and really the whole thing just made me feel like time and money wasted. Also he killed a cat >:("
"855",5,"  Anterior a esto conoc el trabajo del Sr. Guillermo Del Toro cuando vi l pelcula ""El Laberinto del fauno"". En ese momento se convirti en mi pelcula favorita, pero en cuanto termine de ver ""The Shape of Water"" entonces est paso a ser mi pelcula favorita. Maravillosa pelcula en todos los sentidos. Los detalles los efectos visuales, escenografa, vestuarios, msica, el contenido, la manera en que suceden las cosas en esta pelcula es puro y autntico! Al salir compre el soundtrack, y puse en pre-order el Blue-Ray! Por cierto asist a la tanda de medio da (primera tanda 1er da en Puerto Rico ) y en la noche del mismo da fui nuevamente a verla. MARAVILLOSA"
"856",2,"  Very boring.I fell asleep a few times. The pacing is just so slow."
"857",3.5,"  Emotional and pretty fun, i think it's worth less than the actual hype of the audience but it's still a pretty decent, fun movie."
"858",5,"  After being released in December 2017, this film FINALLY made it around to the desolate corner of the world I inhabit, and I couldn't be more thrilled! While the trailers do glimpse the premise of the film, they also fall far short of revealing the true humanity (both heartfelt and horrifying) on display by the time the credits roll. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins embody the fragility and insecurity and aloneness we all feel (or have at times felt), and their redemption in the arms of an unlikely (soul) remind us that life is about our relationships with (and treatment of) each other."
"859",0.5,"  Totally overrated and predictable story. Visually excellent, but take away the technical elements and there is not a lot left. Gratuitous sex scenes were like finger nails on chalk board. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer's performances were the two redeeming qualities, but overall one of the works films I've seen in a long time, and I always try and watch all Oscar nominated films."
"860",4,"  just another fairy tale? we should also look at a film in costume, visuals, cinematography, music, production..."
"861",5,"  A modern masterpiece. The shape of water has great fluidity in character design and depth. Del Toro has made the most magnificent film of the last ten years, hands down."
"862",4.5,"  There was far too much nudity in this film, to the point of making it cheap when the idea was to make it starkly in contrast with the dark world surrounding it in richness. It also was a little tiresome and cliche that all of the protagonists were blatantly weird compared to the rest of society, or shunned. Doing so made anyone normal appear to be a villain, though that is generally not realistic. Other than this the film was fantastic, mostly because it is a visual marvel, the power of the dialogues given in ASL, and Michael Shannon's portrayal of a man who has everything and yet really has nothing inside really shined throughout the film."
"863",2,"  I really don't get the love for this movie. It's somewhere between ridiculous and disgusting. I will say the actors gave it a great effort despite being so blasted weird.If you are artsy fartsy film viewer then maybe there is something here for you. If you like grounded movies that tell a relatable story, this is just the worst."
"864",2,"  Plot should have set this movie to be a straight forward and uplifting film BUT is murdered by the grim, depressing and overly gory tone of the whole movie. If I had to sum it up in a word it was just Bazaar. Technically it was a ""happy ending"" but walked out having watched a very depressing and grim movie."
"865",4,"  Great movie if a little vulgar and risque at times. Great work in the costume and props department, makes me want to make my own amphibious man costume. Most of the vulgarity helps drive the story, but some is just completely unnecessary. the story manages to go into some details, without overly dragging the movie along. If it were less vulgar and risque, it would have gotten 5/5"
"866",0.5,"  Probably the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. Incredibly uncomfortable watching a fish/man and a woman have sex.. don't bring your loved ones or family members to this movie. In fact, don't even waste your time watching it."
"867",2,"  Too dark, dreary, nonsesical dreck. No wonder got Oscar Nominations.Regreted seeing it. Not since Talia (Coppola) Shire enchanted as Stallone's love 'Adriannnn!' has an actress so charmed the audience. The Amphib Reptile mer-man Monster was slightly more improved since the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Tired old villains southern racist misogynist. Mz Hawkins charmed the audience as not done since Mz Coppola as 'Adrienne!' in the first 'Rocky' movie. Yet as a 'mute' she has been nomd for Oscar. Do they still have a 'silent movie' or 'pantomime' category?"
"868",4,"  The Shape of Water is written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. It stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Rickard Jenkins, and Octavia Spencer. The story focuses on Elisa, played by Hawkins. She's a mute woman who works as a janitor at a government research facility in 1962 Baltimore. While working, she notices scientists bring in a creature that looks like a combination of a fish and human. They experiment on the creature, thinking that it might help the US in the space race. When no one is around, Elisa goes to where the creature is held out of curiosity. She then starts communicating with the creature and forms a romantic bond with it. Eventually, she decides to break the creature out of the facility after she learns it's going to be killed. It's a very unique story, so I won't reveal more.This original story is a little bit like Splash or Beauty and the Beast, but is easily the most unique movie I've seen this year. It is a rather strange story. What you think will happen doesn't happen and what you think will never happen does happen. It makes for a simple but odd story that may turn a few people off. As for me, it felt odd at first, but by the middle, it won me over. Once I decided to just go with the flow, I enjoyed this movie. At its heart, this is a simple, sweet romance story with bits of drama, fantasy, sci-fi, horror, thriller, and even a little social commentary thrown in. The cinematography is great as this movie looks beautiful. The music score from Alexandre Desplat is very lovely to listen to, and the acting performances across the board are good, though not great. The characters are investing as they're an outcast in some way. Eliza for example can't talk and she feels the creature is the only one who can understand her. Even the villain here has a feeling of being incomplete.In the end, this is a strange movie, but ultimately very charming and original, especially in this time of sequels and reboots."
"869",0.5,"  While the movie was visually pleasing, I found the storyline to be boring, predictable, and unnecessarily violent. I'm genuinely confused by the hype surrounding this movie. Every year I make sure that I watch the nominees for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and rarely do I disagree with the nominations."
"870",2,"  What is the problem of the director? What childhood issues he didn't solve, that he always has to put ugly violence into his films? This could be an amazing film - and the film music is just a dream. But in the end he ruins everything with extreme violence - which has nothing to do with the story..."
"871",4,"  Beautiful cinematography and great performances. Some weak points - especially at the end, when the story is rushed towards a non-convincing end, becomes uselessly violent and loses its poetic touch"
"872",5,"  It's just fantastic that Del Toro's movies have such deep layers that go beyond the joy that a story like ""The Shape of Water"" provides. You can watch it just for the amusement or you can actually see beyond that and simply learn."
"873",4,"  Unique and visually stunning for certain, The Shape of Water doesn't quite know what story to focus on; giving us themes and perspective shifts that don't feel cohesive. Del Toro's antagonist in Shannon is one dimensional and irritating, with no nuance or development, and he relies too heavily on a gimmick during one of the film's pinnacle scenes; but his protagonists carry the film with gripping performances."
"874",0.5,"  I get the story, but I don't get all the hype. I couldn't get invested in this movie. It boils down to a strange romance between and woman and a sea creature. If I dig deep I could pull out some underlying meaningful story, I guess, but overall I just wasn't entertained . I wouldn't have missed anything if I had left after the first hour like I wanted."
"875",0.5,"  Dire. Forced, unoriginal, (bad) cartoonish, voyeuristic. Tomatometer Critic Chelsea Phillips-Carr is spot on: it ""has almost nothing within it of interest."""
"876",4,"  Acertada y bien dirigida, la obra de Guillermo del Toro se nos presenta como un escaparate de arte visual, con maravillas escnicas y trasfondo hipottico, que hasta cierto punto puede llegar a confundir al espectador. Tcnicamente es fantstica, el guin marca pauta en un ritmo acelerado, las actuaciones son geniales y el pblico debe ser capaz de entender la propuesta en escena para saber las motivaciones de su director. Aun as, no es lo mejor del mexicano."
"877",4,"  Gorgeous but a bit unfocused when it came to character (and the extent to which it was trying to recall Amelie)."
"878",5,"  Someone has to tell me how to stop crying when you see this movie. That creature was designed so beautifully. The girl is not pretty, even can't talk, but they match so perfectly. Everthing is this movie is so flawless. I give this five start and put it all the way to the top of all the movies I have ever seen in my 26 years."
"879",5,"  The best movie of 2017."
"880",5,"  The Shape of Water is a wondrous, sublimely beautiful film that is bursting with heart and overflowing with ideas. It is a unique creation, a testament to the vision of its director Guillermo del Toro. Set in 1962 Baltimore it's a multi layered film that operates on many levels. It is fantasy, romance and even a spy espionage thriller. Without giving too much away a sea creature from South America has been captured and brought to the US. A cleaner at the facility forms a strong bond with the creature. What develops is a film that will sweep you away with its heart and beauty. Emotion overflows and combined with the incredible design it blew me away. Performances are all outstanding but special mention should go to Hawkins, Shannon and Jenkins in their roles. They are truly superb. The score only adds to a film that is an ode to inclusion ,acceptance and love. It is infused with melancholy and hope, making for a very special two hours of cinema."
"881",0.5,"  Wtf! Fish beastiality!? Not feeling it! ....crossed a line, movie leads me to feel that America is morally bankrupt to publish this crap. It's an embarrassment to see this get awards. My dog is sweet and shows affection but you don't see me trying to shag it! Just....GROSS!"
"882",4.5,"  4.6/5. 9.2/10.-JDK"
"883",5,"  Seldom does an Art House movie does as well in every category very much a beautiful story with fantastic imagination and visualizations. The message of love and the problems of prejudice and fear are managed with dexterity. A great movie that can be watched again and again for various reason. Great Art"
"884",5,"  Imaginative, absorbing, visual and oddly romantic, this film was a surprise and a good surprise at that. Who would have thought you could feel for two mute main characters, one a cleaner, the other a fish? Hats off to the film makers for pulling this off with humour and excitement thrown in for good measure"
"885",3,"  I wasnt really drawn in. The character development could have gone further. I think the plot and the sexual nature of the characters made me a little put off by the whole story. Its well shot with a good cast and certainly entertains but I dont think it was really that great."
"886",4.5,"  A nearly perfect film. I can only imagine the low audience score is due to del Toro fans who watched it thinking they were going to see one of his horror/sci fi genre films and were disappointed in seeing a genuinely lyrical fairytale. A wonderful film about love and daring, and learning about one's own nature as a human being or otherwise. This is a film warning about the danger of hating the living truth while preferring ideology instead. What would you do to protect the innocent from torture? It's fascinating to see the low rating from people who had some kind of aversion to the romance with a water creature, because they totally missed the ""reveal"" at the end of the film. It was clear to me from the middle of the film that those scars on her neck were significant, but it seems the detractors just never got it. ."
"887",4.5,"  Beautiful, whimsical, and classic, with a strong push of progressivism"
"888",5,"  the cinematography was amazing. Brsutifully done for sure. Makes you think. One ofthose movies thst uwalk out from and are in awe. Not quite sure how u feel. And then it starts to settle. And u realize how the movie was bigger than u, larger than our banal everyday lives. It really is about how there is touch of monster inside all of us, and what really defines a human. What makes us human? A story abt bout love, compassion, hope, friendship, loneliness, what we seek and desire, the moral choices we all face making and much more. Overall the movie is eerie, whimsical and unusual. Certainly a big contender for the oscars!"
"889",2,"  Didn't make sense, beauty and beast, except beauty mates w beast and beast never is human. Odd movie"
"890",5,"  A great fantasy. Sally Hawkins kept drawing us in. Her boyfriend, well... A god from the Amazon, Aquaman. Breathe."
"891",4.5,"  A beautifully shot love story, The Shape of Water shows us how to be whole within ourselves for who we really are. How good is Sally Hawkins? She is oscar nominated..... playing a mute chatacter."
"892",5,"  I really enjoyed this film. The sets from the 50s were believable. The acting was outstanding. Be prepared to be mesmerized."
"893",4,"  A pesar de su excelente produccin, y magnfica direccin de arte, su historia se queda en el camino. Con algunos errores de direccin, y una historia llena de lugares comunes, La forma del agua se queda en algo que pudo ser increble, pero le falt ingenio."
"894",2,"  Weird movie. Weird concept.I gave it 2 starts purely for the brilliant performances, especially by Sally Hawkins.I don't see why would anyone fall in love with the weird looking 'asset', never mind get naked with it."
"895",5,"  Best movie I've seen in ages, give it all the Oscars. If you like adult fairy tales then this is for you, his best movie since Pans Labyrinth. Beautifully shot, great acting, just stunning."
"896",3,"  Movie's preview says it all--odd fantasy genre. If that's what you're in mood for, then you'll probably like it to some degree. Movie was alright (especially if you pay matinee price or rent it) but nowhere deserving of the ridiculous amount of Oscar nominations (I believe 13). After the movie finished and the lights went up, I looked at everyone's faces, the vast majority of which were confused or bewildered. In addition, two women in my row kept trying to explain what they thought of it but merely kept saying ""I just don't know what to say."" That says it all."
"897",0.5,"  I really want to like it, but I found it a bit presumptuous. I felt like I was suppose to have feelings for fishman and mutegirl but it doesn't really develop. Cinematography is pretty good and a few of the other characters were a little more engaging but the over all movie was little more than a sideshow."
"898",0.5,"  I have long ago learned that rotten tomato reviews are extremely unreliable. This movie had two huge problems. Number 1, the storytelling was atrocious and almost nonexistent. Number 2, the filmmakers treat the audience like idiots. If you'd like to see a movie that has very little in the way of story and what little it does have is thrown in your face, because the movie doesn't think you'll be smart enough to pick up on even painfully obvious clues, than this is the movie for you."
"899",4,"  A Beautifully Filmed Romance Film. This movie is different and it's something you don't want to take your eyes off of!"
"900",1,"  Shittiest movie ever"
"901",1,"  This is a really awful movie. The characters are cardboard cut outs, no motivation or interest. The story is so full of gigantic holes, so riddled with simplistic, obvious foreshadowing, that the ending is robbed of all surprise and the audience is insulted by the stupidity they must adopt to follow the plot. Just terrible."
"902",3.5,"  Overhyped is the operative word here. A pretty and elegant movie that once again is carried by Sally Hawkins, but I wouldn't call it the achievement of the year."
"903",0.5,"  Horrid. I can't understand the hype."
"904",0.5,"  Throughout the film, I kept waiting to see the reasons that it was nominated for so many awards. In the end, I just regretted wasting so much time on a ridiculous, creepy purvey movie that is maybe one of the worst that I have ever seen."
"905",4,"  Enjoyable film, well paced... not the classic love story. Exceptional lead character."
"906",2.5,"  Meh! with all the hype I was expecting more. The story is a romantic sci-fi that is ridiculous at best. Lots of unexplained things even Octavia Spencer's performance was lack luster, and I usually like her. The premise is weak because in a high security facility the only time security is important is in one scene. Why was the equipment made to look old when it's all brand new in that era? Maybe it's a just a beauty and the beast that's all wet?"
"907",1,"  ET for adults, and ET is 100X better. One star because zero stars isn't a choice."
"908",5,"  I was drawn in to this wonderful fantasy, albeit with a monster. Sally Hawkin's performance was perfect through her facial expressions."
"909",4.5,"  Beautifully made film. Well acted. The story just never quite ""hit"" for me - fully."
"910",2,"  Great acting and storytelling but really?! Romance and sex with a sea creature was too far out there - that was just too extreme. Wait for it to be out on RedBox. Save your $ and skip it. Hollywood has gone Hollyweird!"
"911",1,"  Completely overrated. Visually it was great, but enough of the sjw nonsense. Could not connect at all with this movie."
"912",4.5,"  wonderful. captivating. guillermo del toro has shown us his brilliance for storytelling with THE SHAPE OF WATER. who knew the relationship between a 'monster' and a mute could communicate so much. this is the perfect movie for date night. and the rich 1950s setting adds another delicious layer to the experience. i watch many flicks such as star wars & thor. it takes THE SHAPE OF WATER to remind me cinema can reach so much further.be sure to enjoy this at the theatre to take in the cinematography. and torontonians will get enjoyment out of our favourite city woven into this instant classic."
"913",5,"  Did I just see what I thought I saw? Did I feel, what I just thought I felt? I don't go to movies with my mind made up. I want the movie to take me somewhere....in time or space...it doesn't matter. just move me and like a symphony, this did. Wave after wave of brilliant film making encompassing every area of manufacturing such a work was brilliant. This movie deserves every accolade it receives."
"914",5,"  Beautiful poignant and simpleThis movie is tonally and visually perfect. however the story is just a bit too simplistic at places, with the characters all falling clearly on one or the other side of the beautiful grey area that makes you think. Guillermo Del Toro creates a beautiful adult fairy tale and although the story feels a little thin for me, it's still one of the best movies I've ever seen (if not the best).5/5"
"915",2,"  flat out boring movie, the creature looked like Hellboy fish friend, the main character seemed to be obsessed with having sex with this thing, and the story was kind of half ass, it's crazy this guy also made such a great movie pans labyrinth then this? and it's crazy it was up for Oscars, I can't stand the way Oscars look at movies, everything has to have a deep message , and sometimes the message is pretty common sense."
"916",4,"  The Shape of Water is an artistically beautiful film. Although captivating, it could have greatly benefited from more tension and a darker tone."
"917",5,"  Beautiful cinematography with great actors, plot, and music."
"918",3.5,"  It's beautiful movie, featuring emotional story but doesn't fit to my personal taste."
"919",0.5,"  It's hard to rate this. Except for 5 scenes that are unbelievably morally objectionable, which could easily have been left out, it would be an absolutely perfect film. It will drift into cult film obscurity, for those who like their fantasy as a chaser for porn."
"920",5,"  del Toro is a Master Raconteur - Critics can cram it if they diss this incredible story. I want to see an extended version. The audience that watched with me was totally riveted - you could have heard a pin drop. I will pay to see it again on the big screen before I own this masterpiece. Completely recommend this film."
"921",4.5,"  What a great great great adventure, drama and fantasy.Really feel enjoy with this movie. Actually I am not suprisingly If this movie get a lot nominee on Oscar.congratulations The Shape Of Water you bring me so fantasies so wildly."
"922",5,"  It's the best auteur driven ""mainstream"" film out there, that may not outlive Del Toro's previous masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth but may actually be a better film, having been sculpted from pure soul and an outsize imagination."
"923",3,"  hmm; i really like Michael Shannon -- he's such a good bad-guy. this movie was weird though! i think i thought it was supposed to be kinda scary/suspensful, but it is not. it is not at all. it's a fricken love story. & a super weird one at that. i'm not sure i'm on board. the imagery was lovely & the story was fine, but i don't think i liked it. i didn't hate it. but i didn't like it."
"924",1,"  Boring, very disappointing... Could not connect emotionally, full of clichs, I can't believe this movie got so many nominations..."
"925",3,"  Over rated. Hope it doesn't win best picture. Definitely not the best of the year."
"926",4.5,"  I thought I wasn't really going to like this film, but because it got 13 Oscar nominations how could I skip it? (Even if I was worried about a sex scene with the amphibian.) Well, I am so GLAD I went. This was a multi-layered story with excellent performances . Michael Shannon was amazing as the bad guy, as he usually is; Richard Jenkins as the gay friend (an unexpected treat--earning him an oscar nom!); Octavia Spencer playing a character you've seen her play a few times, but she won the Oscar for it so you know she nails it this time too (and got an another oscar nom). And then, Sally Hawkins, as a mute, who carries the film without saying a word, deserving of her oscar nom. The cast is brilliant. Naturally, you have to suspend your disbelief from beginning to end for a movie like this, although they try to make it as true to life as possible. Some scenes really test your ability though. That's OK---this was a great film---it checks all the boxes why we go to the movies (which is what I also said about Slumdog Millionaire.)"
"927",4.5,"  This Guillermo del Toro film that has received so many nominations and awards is certainly a sight to behold. At a top secret research facility in the 1960s, a lonely mute janitor portrayed by the talented Sally Hawkins, forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity. It is a re-imagining of The Beauty and the Beast tale inspired by the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Richard Jenkins also delivers a great performance, Michael Shannon acts like a very evil villain and Octavia Spencer is definitely the comic relief. The music was perfect and it is interesting to see that greenish tone in the entire movie."
"928",0.5,"  Absolutely terrible. Wish I could give 0 stars. Save your money"
"929",0.5,"  Stop with the SJW bullshit"
"930",4,"  Peculiar, arresting and well-made ... and yet I don't want to see it again. If you're wary of Del Toro's endings and subject matter after Pan's Labrinyth, this isn't as bad (but it's not exactly an clear uplifting one either). It's set in the sixties, so if you don't enjoy the inevitable misogyny, racism and toxic masculinity of that era (embodied in the main antagonist) then perhaps give it a miss. It can be difficult to watch at times, but if you're a fan of movies that are confronting and yet arty, this might be just your thing."
"931",4.5,"  Despite the accusations of plagiarism and plot holes, the movie is done beautifully and the original score is one of the best of the year."
"932",0.5,"  A boring and poorly paced movie. Did not enjoy one bit, the visuals were good, but the story unappealing, characters are unrealistic, and it too quickly shifts into some degenerate porno. Would not reccomend"
"933",3,"  Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Phantom of the Opera, King Kong, Splash, and ET all rolled into one. Pretty visuals, very good acting from Sally Hawkins and especially Richard Jenkins. Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri was far better in screenplay, overall acting, freshness, and engagement, without the predictability. Frances McDormand was outstanding in her role, unmatched by anyone else this year."
"934",5,"  An emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance."
"935",4,"  Gorgeous filmmaking. Loved the originality in all. Imperfections are subtle. Too on the nose with thematical threads in B and C stories. Might have done better to explore fewer subplots and backstories. Overall impressive and I would watch again because it's just glorious visually. Cannot conceive of anyone else but Sally Hawkins in that role!"
"936",2.5,"  This movie is very well directed, acted, has amazing production values, score, cinematography, etc. but I just could not connect with the story.I was very underwhelmed overall and think it's quite overrated honestly."
"937",5,"  A beautiful piece of cinematic art, and a love poem to anyone whose love has ever felt ""other""."
"938",5,"  Beautifully crafted, acted and narrated movie. It depicts all the worst and best of human soul in a very well told cinematographic tale."
"939",0.5,"  Completely ruined a great story by telling it as a shallow love story"
"940",5,"  Del Toro is one of my favorite modernn directors and this is a good example as to why.The story and concept is equally deep and,as some negative review point out, a little silly. However i find the odd elements of this to be a good reason why this and most of del toro's films stand out.He likes to tell stories about oddities in the real world. He wants to show off the wall ideas. (See pan's laberynth) and he does it in a way that captivates viewersDel Toro doesnt give a shit what people think. It just so happens he is a genius."
"941",5,"  As the movie ended I was in a haze. A dream like haze which I didn't want to come out of because the euphoria was so intense it felt real."
"942",5,"  WOW!!! I have no words. Simply the best movie I've ever seen this year. The storyline, the cast and the set are totally amazing."
"943",3.5,"  Sure its a bit social justicey with the protagonists being a mute woman, a black woman and a gay intellectual against a traditional white power structure. Oh and a Soviet agent too on the ""good team"". Fortunately for The Shape of Water I am ignoring this propaganda as Michael Shannon was simply too terrific as the villain and Sally Hawkins did a fantastic job with her character even with a restriction of not being able to speak. It is too bad though that this film did have the propaganda though and that the story as a whole didn't hit me fully regardless. A decent film to me though I can understand why its getting the Academy Award nominations, it has a very progressive story after all."
"944",4.5,"  Beautifully crafted film that may be the best work yet by Del Toro. The acting is superb across the board, with Sally Hawkins instantly enchanting Elisa, while Michael Shannon brings layered menace as Strickland. Of course, Doug Jones gives another brilliant performance as the creature, continuing to show he is the Lon Chaney of this generation. Behind the camera, writer/director Guillmero Del Toro crafts a beautiful & intelligent movie, that is a tribute to the 1950's films (like the ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", which this film heavily references) but with modern sensibilities (the racist & sexists attitudes of the day are front & center). The film is visually stunning (the creature effects are nothing short of brilliant) while being a very adult fairy tale (the opening scene in Elise's apartment fully sets that up). Plus, the love story that forms is organic yet magical at the same time. Simply put, one of the finest films of 2017 and just might be Del Toro's masterpiece."
"945",4.5,"  Pra mim  o melhor filme da temporada 2017 - 2018 de premiaes, pois  muito completo. A histria  legal, o filme  bonito, a direo  fantstica. Entendo que no  um filme para todos e que ele tem uma vibe diferente, mas acho que  uma obra de arte."
"946",4.5,"  if i told you about her, what would i say..The Shape Of WaterDragging a man by holding his mouth with only two fingers and crushing or pulling out one's wrecked fingers and a cat being eaten by are not only the scenes that will give you goosebumps but it also lets you cringe yourself on the seat whilst on the other side of it it also contains some genuinely beautiful and innocent scenes like common taste of music and sense of similar symptoms and one of the best is water dripping in the theater. The Shape Of Water isn't just a good movie that came across this year; ""year"" isn't the territory it fits in, it is one of the decades or centuries finest of all. Guillermo del Toro sings all of his love to the phantasmagorical genre films on the highest note possible raising the bar for everyone which won't be easy to surpass. Sally Hawkins; as I have mentioned earlier too, is just soothing on the screen, her calmness, rage, love, fear or even funny emotions just rain drops all over the movie. Michael Shannon is dreadful in it and with all his furious in his eyes and persona he completely overpowers the opposite actors on screen and along with the help of some of the best actors doing their best work (Octavia Spencer, Doug Jones and Richard Jenkins) the film manages to enter the major league easily. The Shape Of Water is filled with hope (that's irony, considering its premise), practicality, amusement and hiding along with all of this, horror."
"947",5,"  Amazing movie! The normals are dysfunctional and the outcasts are pure love. Like no movie Ive ever seen.Must see!"
"948",4,"  This movie may be better on second viewing, but as it played out exactly as I expected, an underwhelming feeling lingers. On too many accounts del Toro restrains himself which leaves the film feeling restless as it falls short in succeeding the same emotional hits that his previous films have. But even a weaker del Toro film is still a thousand times better than most blockbusters."
"949",5,"  Just saw ""The Shape of Water."" Spectacular, magical, tender tale of love, compassion, and kindness. And a movie with a clear animal rights/anti-vivisection theme. One of the few films that has brought tears to my eyes. An absolutely MUST SEE movie. It is clearly the front runner for this year's Oscar for best picture. Go see it! And bring tissues."
"950",0.5,"  Wow what a cluster of just all kind of bad. Simple story we've all heard before, filled with shoddy hole filled storytelling. You want the good version of this, go watch Ron Howard's ""Splash."""
"951",1.5,"  cmon i doesn't take a genius to see the subtext of this film.. degenerate the social norms so that progressive ideals can flourish, also the fish sex scene was pretty gross"
"952",4,"  A strange and offbeat fantasy tale with a nice European flavour. It's Amelie meets E.T. - definitely worth a watch, but conservative viewers are advised to be broad-minded. :)"
"953",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro made what many consider the film of the decade. At least I've heard. And agree."
"954",2.5,"  It was visually pretty good but other than that i don't like this movie"
"955",2,"  Really not type of my movie. Good vintage style but lack of story. And also really weird out with they fall in love.."
"956",0.5,"  Horrible. Silly, gratuitous violence and ridiculous story"
"957",0.5,"  So boring -wanted to leave after the 45 minutes but because of the awards pending wanted to see if it got better .., but actually got worse so Unfortunately had to endure the whole awkward and predictable thing - might have been not bad as a kids or family movie if they removed pointless nudity and gross sexual parts - that really was the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm turned off going to see movies in gerneral when I see crap like this get awards."
"958",2,"  Underwhelming at best - I struggled to finish it."
"959",4.5,"  Such a beautiful film with a very unique story and an intimate way of going about telling it."
"960",4,"  Really a good movie, but don't be surprised if the animal rights folks don't insist on charges of simulated ""Beastiality""."
"961",5,"  Loved The Shape of Water! It's a beautiful story that has you empathizing with the creature and seeing who the bad guy really is."
"962",4.5,"  FINALLY, I've been waiting to review this movie forever!THE SHAPE OF WATER.It's General Zod vs Abe Sapian, you can't make this stuff up...unless you're Guillermo del Toro & Vanessa Taylor of course.At just over 2 hours, I felt the story was progressing at both a brusque & leisurely pace; the movie was a slow burn, but nothing dragged.The cast was the best I've seen in a long time. Michael Shannon as the villain was great, like the one from The Iron Giant, but way more intimidating, like you just had this instinctual need to not be around him, & his slide from sinister G-Man to total psycho felt very natural, it did take more than one bad day to push him over the edge, but it was far less than you'd expect from a government agent; it really was a top tier performance. Sally Hawkins as the heroine was truly the highlight of the film, she was able to run the gambit of emotions & sell her character only with her expressions & movements, she could've easily been a silent film era star. The Gill-Man was amazing! Doug Jones' body language made del Toro's makeup effects come to life in a way that almost made the original Abe Sapian look cartoonish, he made me believe the creature was real. The rest of the cast was great, Octavia Spencer & Richard Jenkins gave a real face & voice to just how bad things were if you weren't a straight white person in the early '60s while giving their characters just the right quirks, foibles, & quiet dignity to endear them to the audience from the start.The film takes place in the early '60s, but it felt more like '40s or '50s film noir. The whole thing looked like Leave it to Beaver, but without the cheep TV gloss, you could see the grime & the beautiful ugliness, it all felt very real.The effects were the best I've seen in a film in a long time. Del Toro has truly married old school practical effects with CGI, together, as they always were meant to be. Thanks to this blending, nothing looked fake; if other films put in this level of effort, modern cinema would be in a new golden age.The music was a gathering of late '50s songs that really put me in the moment, plus one that helped us peer into our heroine's psyche; they really complemented the story.This film was pure art. It took from so many sources: Shakespeare, the Universal Monsters, sci-fi, classic tales of Mer-folk, the post WWII Communism paranoia, & so much more, & rolled them all up, into something that feels both familiar, & original. The Shape of Water easily gets 4 & 1/2 stars out've 5. It's destined to become a modern classic. And it's a shining example that the best stories, are the oldest; in this case: (fish) boy meets girl."
"963",0.5,"  This movie had a good but slow story line. If it weren't for the UNNECESSARY sex scenes... (Uncaring sex, Masturbation, and complete nakedness) it would have been sweet & romantic. Take those scenes out and you've got a great movie... But the scenes almost made it akward to watch, and really had no point to the story line at all. I thinking he world relies on sexual content too much these days... And it ruins great movies. Just saying."
"964",1,"  This movie has to be del Toro winning a bet that who could work creature from the black lagoon into a soft porn, with a dance sequence and a shout out to racial bigotry, homophobia and The Me Too movement, with spys...be ready to laugh."
"965",4.5,"  Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite story tellers and directors. His newest movie The Shape of Water is perhaps his best movie yet. It's moving and thought provoking while at the same time loopy and strange. Just what I would expect from him. Sally Hawkins is wonderful in the film. And Octavia Spencer once again proves she is Oscar worthy. The movie is a fairy tale that only the mind of Guillermo del Toro could have created."
"966",0.5,"  Saw this gem today. A disabled hispanic woman joins a black woman, a gay man and a communist to foil the racist, homophobic, brutal white male power structure and Military Industrial complex in the sixties, in order to save an overgrown piece of sushi.Hollywood Loves it. Excellent cast. Nicely shot. The usual stereotypes and themes.Yawn. jp"
"967",5,"  Guillermo Del Toro is the best! Like Ramses!"
"968",4,"  Lovely story of lonely people or creatures finding each other in a harsh world set against the Cold War era."
"969",0.5,"  Excruciatingly boring. Really. What do people see in this???"
"970",3,"  Wanted to like this more - for it to be truly special and it just isn?t - there are a couple of scenes - but the story is so slight - and the pay off so light...."
"971",4,"  Vivid characterization; believable, atmospheric creature and setting special effects (del Toro's specialty); quirky, well-written script; and nonformulaic elements make this one worth watching."
"972",4,"  Handsome and distinctive like all of Del Toro's movies, this one is also very emotionally engaging and reminded me of what I loved so much about Pan's Labyrinth. Set in the past, it really immerses you in an America gone by while also being a potent allegory for the country in 2017, showing that things really aren't all that different after all.A story about otherness, constantly warring philosophies and an enduring love of cinema, this film swept me off my feet. The performances across the board are fantastic, but Sally Hawkins is who stole my heart. One of the most romantic stories I've seen in a long time."
"973",0.5,"  This was a terrible movie. While the visual effects were good, the story line was disturbing. A hard boiled egg obsessed masturbating mute who is frequently nude (in her home), whether it is her morning bath (masturbation time) or when she's having intimate relations with the mer-man....So much unnecessary nudity, it did NOT make the movie better in any way. I decided to watch the movie in its entirety because there were parts of it that made it seem that the story line would get better, but then...NOPE...over and over. The synopsis description and all the award nominations make this movie appear to be sensational, but in reality it is not. I was truly disappointed and left the theater laughing at how ridiculous this movie was and what a waste of time and hard earned money."
"974",4.5,"  Great story of love. Amazing directing. Amazing acting. Didn't know what to expect but I understand now why the movie is nominated for 13 Oscars. Highly recommend it????????"
"975",4,"  A nice and enjoyable fairytale-film, where a woman and an amphibian creature fall in love. Apart from this, we would never lose the unexpected, over the top, violence made by Guillermo Del Toro, where the amount of blood seen in this movie it's a paradox in contrast with the rest of this cheesy plot, and it's not a criticism."
"976",4.5,"  Stunning visuals (expected), fantastic performances and a great story."
"977",5,"  Beautiful movie <3"
"978",4.5,"  The Shape of Water is an engaging sublime tale about love, marginalization and monsters with mesmerizing performances from Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins. Despite a few tonal inconsistencies and forced moments, Guillermo del Toro presents a wonderful modern adult fairy tale for the times."
"979",4.5,"  Just like its amphibious monster, The Shape of Water is an intricate, beautiful (and delightfully strange) thing."
"980",4,"  A unique and original science fiction love story that is sometimes weighed down too heavily by an unoriginal villain plot line."
"981",0.5,"  The only joy I got from this movie was reading the rants from others that also hated every second of it. Truly awful. Beautiful, but the story couldn't be worse or less well developed."
"982",5,"  Loved it! Well done!"

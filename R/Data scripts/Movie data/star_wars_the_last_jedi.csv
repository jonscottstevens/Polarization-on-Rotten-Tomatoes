"1",2.5,"  My problem wasn't so much with what happened, rather how badly what happened was conceived and written."
"2",2,"  Jumping around in stpid plot lines that when come together you'll realize you've wasted your time watching this movie."
"3",0.5,"  This is one horrible piece of fan fiction. Do yourself a favor, and stop watching Star Wars after episode 6"
"4",2,"  I think Disney is totally wrecking the Star Wars franchise. As someone who remembers the original 3 films that kicked this off, it's very hard to watch what's being done to them."
"5",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is the cinematic equivalent of going to the doctor for a check up and finding out you have 12 minutes to live."
"6",1,"  It no good, it made me sleep. Why is it bad?"
"7",1,"  It was horrible. I was getting bored while watching the movie! What a bad writing. Save your money."

"10",0.5,"  Terrible movie. Depressing with massive plot holes."
"11",3.5,"  Habiendo tenido algo m·s de tiempo para verla, sin duda es una pel√≠cula que tiene much√≠simos problemas, especialmente en su gui√≥n. De hecho algunas posibilidades que dejaron abiertas en la anterior entrega son directamente tiradas al retrete por algunas de las decisiones m√°s estupidas que he visto en el cine √∫ltimamente. Eso s√≠, visualmente es una gozada y la √∫ltima escena con Carrie Fisher y Mark Hamill juntos tiene tanta carga emocional tanto dieg√©tica como extradieg√©tica, que te deja todo con un buen sabor de boca.Esperemos que la siguiente entrega est√© m√°s a la altura..."
"12",1.5,"  worse Star wars movie ever, good job disney and ryan johnson."
"13",0.5,"  Horrible movie, ruined decades of lore and had completely crap characters."
"14",0.5,"  A sickening gut punch of a movie.The visuals and music were gorgeous but thats where the good stuff ends. This was a bad movie and absolutely awful star wars movie. The story made no sense, existing lore and continuity was completely disregarded, Luke is utterly unrecognisable from his original beloved character, dialogue is terrible and plot holes abound.This film as killed the remaining love I had for the start wars universe"
"15",0.5,"  Plot holes, bad side story (Finn, Rose), political messages and a lack of respect of the older characters. It also takes too much freedom with how the force works, it's basically a Deus ex machina at this point. Star Wars is dead."
"16",1,"  Star J Wars - The social justice warior universe. It has nothing to do with the cruel Star Wars universe. This is just commercialize beyond the point of sanity. Stil one star for very decent CGIs."
"17",0.5,"  Star J Wars - The social justice warior universe. It has nothing to do with the cruel Star Wars universe. This is just commercialize beyond the point of sanity."
"18",1,"  Such great characters: Rey, Finn, Poe, Luke, Leia, Phasma, Snoke... All wasted. Didn't really fit the overall story or character developments set up over the last seven movies."
"19",2,"  How many consistency mistakes can you make? Probably cuased by focus on historic stars, story lines and xsucce sfators which do not work any more, at least not for me. So strange that this clumsy movie with overacting actors gets such high scores here."
"20",5,"  The Last Jedi was a great movie, with just 2 decisions that bugged me. 1. The admiral Holdo-Poe conflict was silly and inconsequential, and could have been avoided if she wasn't written in a way to specifically cause anger and conflict.2. Finn's decision to sacrifice himself should have been followed through. They let down a big character changing monent for Finn. Rose's quote in this scene was laughably stupid and cringeworthy.Besides those two points, it is a well directed, beautifully shot movie that was enjoyable to watch and had great action scenes. I'd watch it again, and I can't wait for Episode 9.My honest review of this movie would be 4 stars out of 5, but I want the 5 star review to offset the ridiculous over-analyzing no lifes hating on this movie."
"21",1,"  Luke Skywalker's character was dissed so bad in this film . I can honestly say they made all the characters unlikable .. Director Rian and JJ Abrams .. effed this series royally"
"22",0.5,"  If you were to able to reverse the roles gender wise the women would not have tolerated being the losers that depend on the men to make everything right. So the movie I think failed big time in the writing and characterization of the good guys."
"23",2,"  There were so many problems with this movie from top to bottom. In reading the positive reviews, I'm not sure we were watching the same movies. I watched this at home, which may have missed out on the experience. Poor character development, nonsensical plot, mediocre CGI (especially the stills), and none of the choreography and music that Star Wars has been known to do well."
"24",2,"  Visually amazing in many ways but this has to be the worst attempt at telling a Star Wars story I've ever seenThis is coming from a die hard Star Wars fan who grew up with the movies, video games, books, comics, toys, etc. The whole movie takes place over a span of like 10 hours and does nothing to advance the story. They basically took all the possibilities that TFA set up and threw them out the window. Like is now a coward and useless, Rey is the exact same as before, Kylo is always about to cry, Hux is the least intemidating villian ever, we never find out anything at all about smoke and OH! He's dead now. The entire adventure of Finn and Rose is pointless and just takes away from what's going on with the story. Rose is a completely pointless character who adds nothing. LUKE DIES FOR NO REASON. Leia flies through space. Chewie does nothing. Why doesn't Admeral Halsey just tell Poe or anyone that they aren't all going to die so they don't get involved with the stupid side quest that ends in resistance fighters getting blown up. BB-9E got hyped up and does nothing in the movie. The whole force image of luke that fights kylo is dumb and they both stand really weird the whole time. Rose saves Finn in the speeders by hitting him from directly sideways after she had already turned back and Finn was like 1,000 yards farther along than her. Yoda is great. Ports are great. Nein Nub survives so that's cool. Akbar is dead :(. We still don't really know about Rey's parents or how luke's lightsaber was found. How did the top just rip off of the AT-ST that BB-8 rode on? Soooo what was the point of this movie?"
"25",0.5,"  After years of waiting for luke to return he's a depressed jedi who doesn't want to be found... even after leaving a map behind to find him."
"26",1,"  Really some people thinks this is a Star Wars movie?The original Story is about the Skywalkers, if you want to Watch a movie about pass the torch to a new generation, this is your chance but if you love the original Star Wars Characters avoid this mess"
"27",1.5,"  Very disappointed, I gave it another shot on Blue Ray, it's just as bad, this time even worse because of the negative feelings I already had for this movie. Tried to like it but couldn't, there's no way I'm watching Solo, a pathetic script it's like they re wrote the freaking original with a different spin, but this time it sucks! Killing off one fo the most iconic character in Star Wars franchise. Idiots!"
"28",4.5,"  I loved how the film embraces the idea of balance between the light and the dark. It makes this the most interesting Star Wars film yet."
"29",0.5,"  The problem is the makers of this film where interested more in political statements then making a film worthy of the franchise. Keep ANY politics out of it!"
"30",2,"  I can't believe they were allowed to via away from the original stotyboard, Screwing with the continuity, and leaving no cliffhanger making the last in the trilogy a movie I am no longer interested in. Poorly written, bad choice of director with a self-massaged ego."
"31",1,"  Terrible what have you done ,this is unforgivable"
"32",0.5,"  Can I give this ZERO stars? This was the worst StarWars ever. You kill the ONLY two interesting characters in this movie & you try to FORCE us to be invested in Mary Sue ...I mean Rey, when she is basically Supergirl. This movie wasn't StarWars I don't know what it was. SJW Awakens?"
"33",4.5,"  I loved this movie. I am a long time Star Wars fan who started with episode IV. This is not my favorite Star Wars film to date, but it was defiantly enjoyable to watch."
"34",1,"  IT WAS HORRIBLE....screw rian johnson, kathlene kennedy, and disney for screwing this up...you ruined my childhood with this garbage."
"35",0.5,"  Not only the worst star wars by far but one of the worst movies ever made."
"36",0.5,"  If I could give this zero stars, I would. This isn't just a bad star wars movie, it's one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Serious plot holes, nonsensical meandering story, and the character development (or lack of) is just awful. To make things worse, the filmmakers appear to be pushing political messages throughout the feature. Not something most people want rammed down their throats at the best of times. Certainly not from a franchise loved by generations of people, from all walks of life, who just want what they have come to expect from a star wars movie.This is not star wars. It may have spaceships, blasters and lightsabers, but that's about it. R.I.P. STAR WARS......"
"37",0.5,"  I desperately wanted to like this movie, I really did. I loved The Force Awakens despite its lack of originality. I thought it was a fun movie that gave just the right amount of respect to the original cast while introducing us to an engaging cast of new characters. I had high hopes for the future of the franchise until I saw this flaming bag of dog doo. After leaving the theater in shock at the total disrespect of the characters and the source material, I took a step back and decided that maybe my initial reaction was too strong. Maybe I needed to give it a second chance and accept that sometimes change is necessary to advance the overall narrative of a story. Unfortunately, after a second viewing my aversion to this movie has only deepened. It is painfully obvious to me that the powers that be who created this disaster of a movie sacrificed quality story telling to advance a political agenda(s). They almost smash you in the face with it its so obvious to me now. What a water opportunity, thanks for nothing Rian Johnson."
"38",1,"  Gets 1 star for great visual effects. Other than that, it's by far the worst Star Wars film to date. The writing is atrocious and full of holes. The story goes absolutely nowhere. It's complete and utter ignorance of established Star Wars lore is insulting. A bad movie on it's own, but an even worse Star Wars movie. Avoid this movie like the plague."
"39",1,"  This film didn't respect the past instead they destroyed it too many jokes and no link to the new trilogy but the film is shot beautifully and it could of been better than this. expand the universe Disney make new threat for the new order and the rebels that will make it more interesting. ps mabe a fan of force awakens will like it more just too many missed opportunities."
"40",0.5,"  Disappointing in so many ways. It fails as a story. It fails as a Star Wars movie. It fails as a Science Fiction movie. It fails it's fan base. It fails to entertain. I watched this movie opening night and left with a great sense of disappointment. I went and watched it a second time just to be sure I wasn't missing somerhing. After the second viewing I went from disappointment to disgust. It is as if they gored a director/writer that hated Star Wars and and somehow conned his way into the franchise to destroy it from within. I will see the next instalment, Solo, but if they let me down there, I will resist seeing the final movie as a form of protest against Disney. Is Disney now the metaphorical Empire/First Order. Do we need to form a rebellion?"
"41",1.5,"  Slow and predictable story line."
"42",0.5,"  Rian Johnson ruined the Star Wars"
"43",0.5,"  Really wanted to like it, and watched it a second time. Fundamentally a horrible movie. Take the star wars name out of it, and all the emotion on both sides. It was an awful movie with wasted character dev, poor story, and completely unnecessary plot holes. Lazily written, and for all of the resources and legacy at their disposal, Disney should be ashamed."
"44",0.5,"  Garbage with nice explosions and battles."
"45",5,"  I loved everything about this movies the good parts, the ""bad"" parts, the ones that didn't make sense but I the thing I loved the most were the answers to the questions the last movie left us with like (SPOILERS): Rey being the balance to Kylo (Explaining her powers), Kylos origings and Luke throwing his ligth saber was hillarious"
"46",0.5,"  horrible excuse for star wars movie..too much forced comedy and strong female leads are over done of course. Can nothing happen organically anymore?!"
"47",2,"  This movie had more potential than any before it ,and they killed it in the worst way ,why was luke skywalker ruined he didnt even get to be redeemed through the movie ,never use this director again."
"48",0.5,"  Terrible. Didn't even make sense."
"49",1,"  What a big disappointment!!!!"
"50",1.5,"  It breaks my heart to say it because I've loved all Star Wars films since I was a child, but that changed with this movie. I don't know why critics assumed fans would like this film; I can only guess they're not savvy to the Star Wars fandom. I'm also not sure where they get the idea that the story telling is decent as it is easily some of the worst I have seen in a movie. This is a sequel allegedly but you could easily not watch the Force Awakens as it throws all of the established plot threads and character personalities out the window to do its own thing. Its own thing being gaping plot holes in the star wars lore, badly written characters and pacing that baffles common sense.Visually it is stunning. But cleaning a toilet doesn't change the fact it is still a toilet. It is watchable, but I cannot watch it without shaking my head in frustration. This was the film that needed to answer questions so we could be excited for the final instalment in this new trilogy. Instead it wastes time and gives answers that carry little weight. Somewhere between the stolen motifs of the original trilogy and thoughtless meandering, the film lost itself. It is upsetting to see such a beloved franchise placed in the hands of people who do not understand it, The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise is but a shadow when compared to the Tragedy of the Last Jedi and what it could have been."
"51",0.5,"  such a disappointing movie, flawed in almost every way possible. single handedly divided a unified fan base and destroyed a great franchise. star wars is dead."
"52",0.5,"  sin duda la peor pel√≠cula de star wars , los vacios argumentales que hay entre el episodio 7 y 8 son horrible toda las dudas que te genero el episodio 7 a que te las tiran por la cabeza---- quien son los padres de rey? nadie? entonces por que mierda le dieron tantas vuelas en el episodio 7 y por que se ven los padres de rey o quien sea abandon√°ndola en el planeta ¬ø quien es snoke ? a quien le importa si ya esta muerto ¬ø que sera del grandioso luke skywalker? nada solo se volvi√≥ un ermita√±o que intento matar a su sobrino por que vio maldad en el jajajajaja nada que ver con el luke de verdad que intento salvar a su padre del lado oscuro sabiendo todo lo malo de sus acciones y lo todas la gente que mato ... a si el guion de la pelicula es asco ose como 20 minutos de relleno en la parte del casino que al final no sirvi√≥ de una mierda .... en tema de los personaje nada bueno- finn literalmente un personaje de relleno y igual que rose- rey no avanza nada como personaje-poe tampoco y lo hacen parecer un est√∫pido- kaylo ren es el √∫nico que vi que avanzara como personaje y para mi fue el mejor de la peli ..... en fin toda la culpa de este desastre de peli tiene nombre rian johnson por no guiarse de los borradores de jj abrams para que no tuvi√©ramos tenidos estos vacios argumentales y esta basura"
"53",1,"  This movie doesn't just have plot holes. The entire movie IS a plot hole. As a Star Wars fan since I was maybe 3 years old it just makes me sick what they have done with this series. The problems really started with The Force Awakens, but while that movie had issues, this sequel takes a nose dive right into the ground. The four young main characters of the film are Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren. Each of these characters is effectively ruined by the end of the film. Rey, as the Force-user of this series, doesn't really need any training. In The Force Awakens she picks up a lightsaber for the first time and defeats Kylo Ren with it. This would be like Luke defeating Darth Vader in A New Hope. But anyway, we are told throughout The Force Awakens that Rey needs to find Luke who is missing. Why? To get trained, we assume. The entire first movie is a buildup to the cliffhanger scene at the end where Rey meets Luke, and then the film rolls to credits. Yet in The Last Jedi, Luke doesn't train Rey at all. She accomplishes nothing while she is on the island with Luke, except for the fact that she is able to connect with Kylo Ren through the Force, which is one of several Force-powers that we, as an audience, have never seen before. Poe is emasculated in this film. He's supposed to be the Han Solo of this series but he is told he is making bad decisions time and time again by the female leaders of the resistance. Finn might as well not have even been in the movie. He is treated right off the bat like a joke. After trying to heroically save Rey and nearly being cut in half at the end of The Force Awakens, we see him walking around half naked in a water balloon. Because why? I guess it was supposed to be funny. He then spends the rest of the movie running around with this new character Rose on a fool's errand, trying to find some device that will do something to help the Resistance ships escape the First Order because the First Order has some tracking device that blah blah blah blah. Its all a big plot device that doesn't make much sense and doesn't matter anyway by the end of the movie. Finn and Rose also spend time on a Casino planet saving a bunch of anime-horses from being abused while at the same time leaving a bunch of children in slavery. They could have saved the kids from slavery and left the horses but instead they went with saving the horses. Near the end of the movie, Finn has a chance to save the Resistance by destroying this big cannon that the First Order is going to use against the Resistance. He attempts a suicide run but is stopped suddenly by Rose. Because why? I have no idea. Her stopping his suicide run made no sense. Now the First Order is just going to kill them all, right? As far as she knows anyway. Also they're having this little love scene right in front of the First Order. Why the First Order didn't kill both Finn and Rose right there I have no idea. Kylo Ren, and really the entire First Order for that matter, are no longer threatening villains. Kylo was defeated by Rey (who had no training) in the first movie, so why should we as an audience feel threatened by him? Same goes for General Hux. In this opening scene of the movie, instead of having an impressive battle sequence, the director of this film opts to have a joke scene where Poe calls Hux and plays some kind of phone game with him, and Hux falls for it. This is supposed to be funny but its not. What it does is basically render Hux a non-entity. We no longer care about him or are threatened by him after this. Captain Phasma? Another wasted character. She shows up for 30 seconds and dies. They bring Admiral Ackbar in just to kill him off screen. If Admiral Ackbar had been the one to do the suicide run with the Resistance ship instead of Admiral Holdo, it would have mattered. We care about Ackbar. We don't care about Holdo. But they killed Ackbar off screen. The entire sequence with the First Order chasing the resistence fleet makes no sense. Why doesn't the First Order just hyperspace jump in front of the resistance fleet? Why don't they send starfighters to kill the Resistence fleet? Why does the Resistence just send everyone out on transports like Finn and Rose did? None of it makes any sense. Not sure why Leia was in this movie either. We see her using the Force for the first time to save herself from space. Here's two problems with that scene. One: she uses the Force to get back to the ship, but how does she get into the ship through the door without killing everyone inside it? Two: if Leia was so powerful with the Force, why doesn't SHE train Rey? Why does Rey have to go find Luke if she's already got a powerful Force-user right there who can train her? Not that Rey gets trained by Luke at all anyway. The saddest part of this whole movie is Luke. Luke is the hero of Star Wars. Luke risks everything in Return of the Jedi on the belief that he can save his father, Darth Vader, the second most evil guy in the universe, from the dark side, and he succeeds. Why would this hero then turn around and try to murder his own sister's son in his sleep just because he sensed a little dark side in him? Luke would never do that. Never. He also would not hide on an island while that same nephew murders Han Solo and blows up a planet with the Starkiller death star thing. The Luke of this movie is basically a coward. What this movie has accomplished is that it has essentially rendered the sequel trilogy null and void. There is no reason to continue with Episode 9. None of these characters matter anymore."

"66",1,"  worst movie of the star wars and sci-fy in general."
"67",0.5,"  mammmmacita esta pelicula es terrible"
"68",1,"  Great visuals but poor WRITING and storytelling"
"69",1.5,"  Good: -Visual Effects (Real and CGI) were amazing-Cinematography shots were beautiful. Bad:-Plot was terrible, didnt tie in with the previous movie. -Random sub plots that were annoying rather than enjoyable. -Story arch was unimaginative and poorly written"
"70",3,"  This star wars is about as fresh as road kill....!!!!I guess it really doesn't matter because it's going to make billions for Disney no matter how redundant it is. Hopefully the next one will have a better script, and the characters will be entertaining and new.For an $8 ticket, you get $8 worth of entertainment."
"71",0.5,"  Hated it. The way Luke dies, the way Snoke dies, and Star Wars dies the exact same way after this film. The film did suprise me here and there but not in a good way. You may have heard it all before but it is a remake of the origanals. The battle of Crait was like the battle of Hoth (the rebellion, as it is now being called again, are being punished by the bad guys and they need to escape). Snoke makes Rey watch the Resistance be demolished in space (like Palpatine with Luke at the battle of Endor). The only new things was the casino which makes it feel like a Dinsey film not a Star Wars film, Luke's character and Star Wars trying to be comedy. Rey hardly has any training and still kicks ass (because of all the feminists today trying to say women are better), Ackbar, a great rebel leader loved by many fans, dies and nobody cared, Holdo takes over and cant be bothered telling her crew what her plan is, causing a huge fight between everybody and waite until most of the Resistance escape pods have been destroyed. Poe turns from a strict pilot who knows what to do to becoming a joker and making decisions he knows that are wrong to blow up a dreadnought, causing most of the fleet to vanquish. And last but not least of all the HUGE disappointments is Leia being able to fly, this one is self exlanatory and I dont need to say anything here. But here is everything I liked about the film now:Thanks for reading."
"72",1.5,"  Biggest flop in SW history. Horrible story telling, killed nearly all continuity and context. Poor decisions, bad writing and characters we are forced to care about... but still don't. They ruined all potential with the classic characters, opting for quick gimmicks and surprises over good character arcs. It's a pretty film, Disney production but, it pretty much ruins Star Wars for me."
"73",1,"  Just more reboots. Lacks that Lucasfilm imagination in ships, planets, characters and story. The death of a legacy."
"74",0.5,"  Too many inconsistencies. The Force Awakens had a few, but this carries it to new heights. As a hardcore fan of Star Wars, I'm not someone who is hard to please. I want to like anything with the brand name. This one, I can;t.First, Rose is on the same level as Jar Jar Binks. Not the actresses fault, just a poorly written story. The entire Fin & Rose arc was TERRIBLE. Fin was somewhat redeemable at the end when he attempts to sacrifice himself, which then gets foiled by Rose.The bombers in this movie are pathetic. Y-Wings would have been far better for the bombing run at the start. All the villains feel incompetent instead of clever. Not to mention, supposedly the First Order has been in the shadows moving so as to not attract attention, then in this movie they are apparently the unstoppable war machine.Rey is still a Mary Sue. Luke is a sissy. And talk about a slap to the face, we don't even get to see Luke mourn for his best friend Han Solo. Additionally, Luke isn't even Luke. You know, Luke, who risked all to save his father. In this movie, he tries to kill his nephew on a whim.What was that last battle? Sure, we'll throw the EU out. Then in Rogue One we show that Star Destroyers have the ability to hover above a city. But in this movie, the Star Destroyers can't enter the planet's atmosphere? One Star Destroyer could've destroyed the entire base at the end no problem.Nope, instead lets land a full mile away and slowly walk an attack force up to the door.This movie was pathetic. It wasn't even enjoyable. I'm not digging into EU concepts because Disney said they don't matter. Fine. At least make a movie that makes sense. This one didn't even fit with any of the past movies. And to make it worse, I came out only having enjoyed one scene, and that was the Kylo Ren fight. (Snoke's death was also as pathetic as the rest of the movie)"
"75",0.5,"  At first though it was a good movie. But it isn't . It has pointless scenes, forced humor, but most of all: disrespected the characters."
"76",2.5,"  An uneven tempo and ham-fisted attempts at humor derail an awkward approach to a classic series."
"77",0.5,"  This has been the worst Star Wars movie ever."
"78",0.5,"  It's a bit late, but I dislike Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I was disappointed about, Luke, Rey,Supreme Leader Snoke, and pretty much the whole story line."
"79",0.5,"  Systematically undermined all the characters of the original trilogy, reversing Luke's character progression entirely.Went from HUGE star wars fan who was excited about the New Canon, and this made me abandon Star Wars entirely.... it's been rough..."
"80",1.5,"  co-directed by tommy wiseau?"
"81",0.5,"  Dropped the ball in every possible way. Would be fine if this movie was just bad and uninteresting; however, it somehow managed to tarnish the legacy of the originals while also damaging the future of the franchise."
"82",5,"  I am not 100% certain as to why this is getting such good reviews with critics, and such terrible reviews with audience. Is it possible that so many audience members truly had no idea what they were going to see? This is quintessential Star Wars, and the newer generation is wrecking the acting of the original one. Mark Hamill's acting in this, is the WORST part of the movie. No one is giving Adam Driver enough credit, and YES the ""last jedi"" is going to be a god damned woman! Why is everyone having such a hard time with this? Rey is 10x the jedi that Luke was anyway. I don't get it. I really feel as though everyone forgot that this is the 8th film in a franchise. Did you see 1-3? Go complain over there."
"83",1.5,"  Another movie franchise that should not have been remade. Lost the movie magic from the classic, now they have made into a crappy film. My 'favorite' part of the movie is when Princess leia dies, but somehow magically flies back to the ship. If you kill a character - kill the character."
"84",0.5,"  I am sorry to say that this movie did little to nothing to advance the franchise of Star Wars. In fact it did a lot of damage. The story writing was bland and the movie editing techniques were poor. Strong story writing raises all characters to the next level. It is not totally dafaming some characters in order to raise others up.Furthermore it leaves us with little to look forward to. If the Mantra of Star Wars is Hope against all odds, this movie did what it told me I need to to It Failed in all categories except one. the visuals were great, and that is all credited to the CGI team and not the director or the producers. Episode 9 has it's work cut out for it. Good Luck JJ."
"85",0.5,"  This was easily the most disappointing movie experience I have ever had. Abrams did a fantastic job with The Force Awakens , creating an intriguing new story and developing meaningful characters essential the to the trilogy. However, all of that is nullified in this movie. The movie revolves around a sense of magical realism that only small children with no higher than a 1st grade education could find remotely plausible, even for a Star Wars movie. The director of The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson, is either the least qualified person on earth to direct a movie or he intended to decimate the characters and plot that were set up in The Force Awakens. He provided us a film with literally no significance or resemblance to the other movies, ruined the integrity of the franchise and introduced absolutely ZERO meaningful plot twists or sequences to set up the next movie. Disney should seriously consider making a another second installment to replace this atrocity as it would generate more revenue for them and provide Star Wars fans with a restored purpose to watch the third installment."
"86",0.5,"  Absolutely awful. I dont even want to see episode 9 now."
"87",2,"  Probably the worst star wars movies to date. Great visuals but a terrible story."
"88",1,"  Its funny to see so many 5 star reviews , trying so hard to make up for the negative reviews even though they merit the backlash for being the worst star wars movie ever made."
"89",1.5,"  The movie is an abomination."
"90",0.5,"  pOSSIBLY THE WORST stAR wARS FILM TO DATE, YES WORSE THAN THE PREQUELS.bETRAYING THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER WHILE PROVIDING NOTHING OF VALUE IN ITSELF. rOSE AND fINN ARE COMPLETELY POINTLESS TO THE OVERALL STORY, rEY'S MARY SUE POWERS ARE STRONGER THAN EVER AND aDAM DRIVER CONTINUES TO BE THE ONLY GOOD ACTOR WHO'S NEITHER MARK HAMIL NOR CARRIE FISHER.gO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE."
"91",1,"  Not plot holes but plot craters, stupid humor, disrespect to characters."
"92",0.5,"  This movie is so bad I will never buy it on dvd. The story is poor the political views shoved into a script that destroyed and ruined Luke and Fin and Poe. It felt like they took parts from the original film and squashed them together in the hope it would work. WRONG..... canto bite is so poor and makes no difference to the plot I'm sure it's a joke played on us all and mr Johnson is laughing in his SJW dark bubble wondering how he got away with this hatchet job. I've returned my DVD and got a full refund this will never get into my Star Wars collection."
"93",0.5,"  Worst movie ever!!!!!!"
"94",3.5,"  bad structured movie but ray kylo and luke carry this movie."
"95",0.5,"  I can't believe how bad this movie was. I've been a huge Star Wars fan since I was 6, and this movie was horrible. The characters we've come to love are exploited in what is essentially creative expression gone wild. It ignores established character traits, and attempts to create emotionally charged connections with new characters we don't even hear speak. Creating very awkward distractions. Star Wars has always tweaked the laws of physics to a certain extent, but the opening battle is ridiculously over the top. Not to mention the first orders ridiculously poor performance. Worst yet the plot try's to reference today's political atmosphere in not so subtle references to feminism, racism, and Marxist references to social inequality. An all to familiar pattern now of the bad white men was quite oblivious. The only exception (Poe) essentially acting like a child who won't listen to his mothers. That is when he wasn't killing everyone by himself. Seriously it was like watching someone play Mario cart at times. I'm going to try and forget this movie was ever made."
"96",1,"  Disapointed they decided to change everything and the director decided to rewrite everything."
"97",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars ever made. Has fantastic visuals, but the story has many flaws, is weighed down with needless distractions, silly moments, characters that go nowhere, and ultimately dishonors the character of Luke Skywalker. This was a wasted opportunity for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher and the film makers, who could have given us such a powerful story. But as it is, this film has little return value for me. Very annoyed."
"98",1,"  After such a good restart with The Force Awakens and then Rogue One this is such a disappointment. So many jarring parts such as the Mary Poppins scene and so many others, wasting good characters and failing the spirit of the Star Wars saga."
"99",2,"  This looked like a Star Wars film but it sucked my head, heart and soul dry. I hated the SJW Agendas and pissed me off big time. Visual effects, sound design and musical score was good. Most of the deleted scenes in the DVD should have been included in the movie. Ruin Reylo Johnson is an arrogant snobby self righteous novice filmmaker and bad writer. He didn't take risks and gave TFA the middle finger. It is a poorly made film with shallow characters which literally destroyed Legendary Luke Skywalker. Oh and Leia as Space Jesus...????????????"
"100",0.5,"  The movie has a lot of holes in the plot. Script is boring, and written for small children, not for adult people. How is it possiple, any one accepted, so stupid story. The Story is a problem, not treating characters, for me"
"101",0.5,"  A shell of its former self, this movie lacks everything that makes star wars what it is, other than the special effects. Overall, boring movie, awful writing."
"102",1.5,"  It wasn't as bad as the force awakens, but it made me feel like I just got in a fight with my girlfriend and realizes I don't really want to be with her any more, so far the new trilogy is just terrible, Rouge One was great, instantly became my new favorite, even over empire. But this is horrible, bad writing followed by having characters introduced and guving no explanation about who or why they're there, and then just as fast get rid of them"
"103",2,"  Not consistent with the lore from previous movies."
"104",1.5,"  This was a slightly better film than the phantom menace. The movie starts off well enough but very soon (with in 10 minutes) takes a nose dive into a world of plot holes, political non scene and a complete disrespect for the story told before it. I'm not going to talk about the weak characters or pepper thin plot, that has already been done. Let's instead talk about the horrable treatment of legacy characters. Who are these people??? Luke would never act the way he did. Leia was a non factor. Chewie was pointless..... yada yada.... look I'm not passing judgment on you if you liked this movie and to be honest I didn't hate it. That said.... if this is where the franchise is going eh I will wait till the come to blu ray.... then again I might be out."
"105",0.5,"  SPOILERS: A lot of plot holes, wasted opportunities, and character assassination of Luke's character. Rey is stronger than Luke with almost no training. Finn meets Rose and goes on a pointless mission. Leia floats through the vacuum of space and doesn't die, even though it would have made sense because Carrie Fisher (RIP) passed away during post-production. The Knights of Ren are gone and its never explained what happened to them. Are they Snoke's bodyguards? Who knows? Poe becomes a dumb stereotypical ""male rebel"" character. They never explain how Snoke brought Kylo to the dark side, didn't explain how Kylo killed Luke's students. Luke try's to kill Kylo or (Been Solo) in his sleep even though Luke almost died to prove that there was good in Darth Vader. Rey's parents are nobodies. Didn't explain how or why Rey hears voices from Obi-Wan and see's visions from Lukes 1st battle with Vader, in the Force Awakens when she touches Luke's Lightsaber. Luke sends a projection of himself to fight Kylo so the rebels can escape, but even though he just projects an image of himself he still dies? I could go on but these were the big ones. This movie disappointed a lot of fans. Also hated the fact that Finn is supposed to be an Important character for blacks (because I'm an African-American Male) and He is a useless character. But whatever I'm just another ""Fan Boy"" according to the producers."
"106",1,"  Wasted opportunity. Ruined the lore of star wars, ruined good characters, poorly written movie. Just so disappointing."
"107",0.5,"  Star Wars Episode VII The Last Insult is atrocious. George Lucas would be rolling in his grave if he wasn't still alive. The Farce Awakens didn't do him in, but this just might. He should buy up Disney. Get control of his movies back. And then break out that same hammer that he wanted to use to smash every copy of The Star Wars Holiday Special. P.S. This makes The Phantom Menace look like Citizen Kane by comparison."
"108",0.5,"  The worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. The Prequels put this film to shame. Characters feel completely forced in and unnatural into the Star Wars universe, plot points from the previous film are forgotten or answers in a way that makes them feel unimportant and makes you appear stupid for thinking they were. Disrespects the mythos of Star Wars and its original characters, and to top it all of, the high ups at Lucasfilm continue to insult the original fans for not liking this movie. Basically if you don't like this movie, your a man baby, a racist, an sexist, and you live in your parents basement. Do not support the Star Wars IP under the influence of Kathleen Kennedy. Do the exact opposite of what Kylo Ren tells you to do. Let the past live, revive it if you have to."
"109",2,"  Loaded with badly placed humor and lack luster story telling. Most major scenes are trivialized by snarky comments and quips and the character development arks are ridiculous."
"110",0.5,"  I was excited for this movie, and I remember going opening night. Now, I'm a fan who will willingly go to the theaters to rewatch the Phantom Menace in 3D (and I hate 3D). I love the prequels, I love almost everything star wars related, and even with all it's flaws, I enjoy Force Awakens (it was a rehash, and Rey was to perfect of a character, but it had promise). With this though, it's the first time that I didn't want to rewatch it, I didn't want to go back and see it again, I don't even want to go see Solo or 9. That's a problem if a fan such as I, who eats up almost everything star wars doesn't even want to see it or other things from this current trilogy any longer."
"111",1,"  Bad story telling, is disjoint from The Force Awakens and tried to hard to be something different. I have no issues with Luke dying or Snoke dying. But I have issues on why Luke decides to kill Ben as is not convincing, nor was how Be becoming Kylo as it was just due to Luke's igniting his lightsaber. Poorly build up, poorly done. Leia the mother of Ben does not come out of the ase to confront her son, what kind of mother in the world would do this?"
"112",0.5,"  The last Jedi is so disappointing on so many levels"
"113",1.5,"  If Star Wars: The Force Awakens left you intrigued over its mysteries and cliffhangers, lower your expectations now. Watching The Last Jedi, it's unclear whether Rian Johnson has never seen The Force Awakens, or was simply uninterested in the foundation it built for the new trilogy. Either way, nearly every plot thread and mystery established in TFA is at best ignored, and at worst given the most disappointing resolution possible.Even beyond its disregard for its immediate predecessor, The Last Jedi is so poorly written it's hard to believe. Plot holes, lore inconsistencies, and absurd conveniences abound. The entirety of the story hinges on a well-established character acting in complete contrast to his/her well-established personality, with almost no explanation. Future Star Wars films will have to work desperately to patch the holes blown into the fabric of this world and its workings, as The Last Jedi irreversibly changes the series' mechanics of space travel and combat. Further, the movie's shoehorned morals are at best nonsensical and at worst sociopathic. If you see the movie with a crowd, you will likely be able to hear the sound of eyes rolling in tandem at one particularly preachy scene, as Star Wars' new worst character delivers Star Wars' new worst line and demonstrates the film's creators' incredible lack of self-awareness.That said, some small amount of credit must be given for the film's striking visuals and a few standout performances. In particular, Mark Hamill gives perhaps the best performance yet in any Star Wars film and demonstrates his incredible professionalism in the face of a very poor script. Unfortunately, his talent, presence, and gravitas are dramatically underused.Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a nihilistic, depressing, and straight-up dumb story that squanders its nearly every opportunity, and leaves the Star Wars canon broken likely beyond repair."
"114",1,"  Definitely very boring and too long, but the unacceptable apects are the loopholes in the plot and the poor character arcs. As a Star Wars fan, it's sad to see the way Disney has gone with the new films. The Force Awakens tried to be a carbon copy of A New Hope thus opening large gaps in the story, while this film doesn't fill in any of the plot holes and doesn't even follow the plots introduced in Awakens. Who is Snoke? How'd he come into power? Nevermind - he's really dumb and is now dead. How do people think the Jedi are a myth only 30 years later? Why does no one know about ""The Force?"" Nah - anyone can tap into the force at will without training - especially people that are nobodies, go to arguably the greatest Jedi for training, get denied said training, decide to go meet two of the most powerful people of the dark side, and are equally as matched to them and manage to kill everyone and escape unscathed. I'm not going to mention anything about Luke Skywalker's character arc because it's so ridiculously off target there are way too many things to even break down. So basically, it's a disaster and the writers should be embarrassed with their efforts."
"115",0.5,"  Rian Johnson ruined the Star Wars saga with this stupid movie."
"116",0.5,"  expecting a X Wing Kamikaze Hyperdrive cheese strat for episode 9!! Great Movie!! consider swallowing a tide pod rather that watching this piece of plot hole trash!"
"117",4.5,"  Star Wars is a long series with many ups and downs, and after the Force Awakens, it's formula was starting to get old. Choosing Rian Johnson to direct such a big-budget film was a risky move by Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, but it ultimately paid off. Johnson has completely refreshed Star Wars, giving it a chance to continue without repetitiveness or staleness. No other director could have pulled off something like this without such a flourish of amazing visual symbolism, interesting story, great character renderings, uproarious comedy, and glorious action scenes. This is definitely a Star Wars movie to be remembered, but one that is not without it's flaws. The Canto Bight scene, while beautiful, drags on and ultimately accomplishes nothing, as does Benicio Del Toro's entertaining but unnecessary character. All in all, Rian Johnson did a surprisingly great job with The Last Jedi, and it is no wonder that he is getting to start his own trilogy which will undoubtedly be as good or better!"
"118",1.5,"  Nearly left the theater. I'm done."
"119",0.5,"  This movie was a complete disapointment for me. However, If your the type of person that likes action and can ignore plot holes watch it.This movie was insulting to the Star wars universe, unoriginal and makes the force awakens even worse. The movie trashes who Luke Skywalker was in the return of the jedi. KYLO is a whinny punk who temper tantrums his way thru the film and you never buy into him as a bad guy to fear. the first order is an army of stooges who can't seem to get things right. REY faces no obstacles and forrest gumps her way on this adventure... oh and DISNEY feels the need to throw their two cents on current day affairs in sci fi fantasy. This is the only place i could vote to showcase my displeasure of Star wars DISNEY. I won't see IX. It"
"120",0.5,"  The Disnification of Star Wars has finally arrived, tragic."
"121",1.5,"  Visually stunning mess."
"122",1,"  By far the worst star wars movie ever made. I really wish they would remake this one and then continue the trilogy."
"123",5,"  I loved that this movie brought out so much butthurt in people. Angry little keyboard warriors whining and crying about how this movie ruined Star Wars -- it's hilarious. The original Star Wars trilogy wasn't that great to begin with and the prequels were abysmal made in America trash. This one is made in America trash, too -- just look at the horrible audience reviews!! You can't argue with that!!Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, midichlorians, silly bad guy names like Dooku and General Grievous, Hayden Christensen's bad acting, Mark Hamill's bad acting, Carrie Fisher's bad acting, Natalie Portman's bad acting, the execrable Padme and Anakin ""romance"" -- that stuff already ruined Star Wars.Hopefully, for the next Star Wars movie, Rose Tico becomes the most powerful Jedi of all time without any training whatsoever and single-handedly destroys Kylo Ren, the First Order, and a whole slew of evil white men.Ha ha, have fun whining and crying, losers!!"
"124",0.5,"  The forced political message absolutely ruined this movie. Besides that, the story was just awful. Easily the worstStar Wars movie, not even close. When will these people learn?"
"125",0.5,"  Terrible Story.. Nothing make sense what so ever. Worse than the prequels"
"126",5,"  Despite numerous flaws, the positives outweigh the negatives, leading to a mostly satisfying experience overall."
"127",1.5,"  When you realize thE PHANTOM MENACE WAS BETTER THAN THIS...."
"128",1.5,"  bizarre CONCOCTION OF STAR WARS + MARVEL MOVIES + SYFY CHANNEL MOVIES AND what-not, BUT NOTHING CLOSE TO WHAT STAR WARS - THE LAST JEDI (SUCH A GRAND TITLE) SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THIS movie IS MADE FOR FANS OF DORY, NEMO, lightning mcqueen and tow mater. no serious star wars fan should tolerate this insult to intellect. i'm rating it 1.5 stars just because the director made luke skywalker happy by having him drink that green milk squirting out of the mammary glands of the lounging dinosaur."
"129",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is the worst star wars movie ever!!!!"
"130",0.5,"  Absolute garbage tier movie that did no justice to the legendary start of the sequel movies... unbelievable move on the director's part. Way too much humor in places where it shouldn't be, riddled with plot inconsistencies, and zero character development. I would suggest not watching this movie, as we seem to be almost exactly where we started in the movie. The Disney/Marvel influence pandering to foreign audiences is palpable, and quite detracting from the franchise. This physically pained me to watch one of my favorite take such a hit. Please fire whoever the hell you decided to direct this, and bring back the old franchise."
"131",0.5,"  I've waited a long time to write this review and probably do not have anything to say that has not already been said. I'm terribly disappointed in this movie and in the critical response to it. Critics look at films for such things as relevance, plot, structure. We study critical theory and look closer at a film than the general audience, priding ourselves for understanding such things as narrative and context. Critics look at every scene for often ridiculous pieces of evidence to apply to ambiguous theories and this is why critics are so often out of touch with what an audience enjoys. When people are enjoying a great story, critics are delving into the subtext and looking for inapplicable symbols to express their theory; whether its an insane focus on phallic and yonic symbolism or Freudian stretches to an Oedipal complex, or forcing the characters into a Marxist clash that doesn't exist in the script. Then you have a trainwreck of a film like this which audiences are immediately turned off to and somehow critics jump to the other side and praise the film for all of its worst attributes. Suddenly narrative does not matter. That the majority of the film was wasted on a subplot that made no sense somehow escapes the notice of critics. Those of us who criticize the film are lambasted as disillusioned ""fan boys"" or heckled for wishing the film was just like Empire. This is nonsense. This whole film was nonsense but what is particularly upsetting about it was its missed potential. Johnson introduced a number of compelling ideas, gave us a taste of them, had us lean in for a second, and then snatched it away for no reason at all. People say that the fans who disliked the film are holding on to the Skywalker legacy or some other nostalgia, but that's not true. I wanted new Star Wars. Nothing would have made me happier than having something new and exciting, but that's not what this film did. It kept making itself look like it was going to do that and then just pulled away and killed itself...every chance it got. There is no way that anyone watching this film can make sense of it because if there is a theme to this movie, it is that nothing matters. Nothing that happened before matters, and everything will just work itself out in the end so nothing that happens now matters, either. SPOILERS AHEAD: This film builds on J.J. Abrams' Episode VII which, while there were some issues with the film, was in retrospect a fairly solid platform for this trilogy to build upon. Abrams introduced some very compelling characters and integrated the familiar faces from the original franchise very well. There were some plot holes and a few inconsistencies and errors of logic (such as Han looking up at the sky and seeing the republic capitol planets exploding when he should not have been able to) but some of these are to be expected in Star Wars. The original films are full of logical fallacies that we can easily ignore. Johnson, however, took logical inconsistency to a whole new place. One very large problem that maybe other people aren't bothered with, are the issues with time. Previous films have also taken some liberty with the concept of time. Empire has Luke running to Dagobah and spending what seems to be months in training with Yoda in the same time that Han and Leia are spending a few hours running from Vader's fleet (which can be accounted for with the amount of time it might have taken them at sublight speed to reach Bespin). Episode II had Yoda assemble and transport an entire army of clone troopers from the outer rim to Geonosis in the couple of hours that Anakin and Obi-wan were held captive. The fleet in Rogue One manages to respond nearly instantly to an air strike call and the large battle at the end of the film despite that the supported characters were several hours ahead of them. In Episode 8, however, we're made to believe that a fleeing capitol ship containing the remnants of the resistance is given 16 hours worth of fuel (worst ticking clock device ever), and in that time, much of which is already consumed by Finn's recovery and attempted escape, Finn and Rose are able to flee the ship (which also made no sense with the device of the ship moving too fast for fighters to be able to attack it), jump to another star system, search a casino city, get arrested, spend a night in a jail cell, flee from the police, be ""rescued"" by another person, and get back to the place where the resistance is being pursued. This is a minor problem when you consider that nothing they did on that planet made any sense or had any real purpose. They had to find ""code breaker"" (spend two weeks coming up with that name, Disney?"", but they get arrested instead...but that's okay, we don't need code breaker anyway. He was the only person who could sneak them onto a star destroyer, but doesn't matter because there's another person in the jail cell with them who can do the same thing that he was the only possible person to do. Rey needs a teacher, but Luke won't do it...but that's okay, because she doesn't really need a teacher anyway. But then Yoda tells Luke that they can't lose Rey, so Luke does absolutely nothing to help her anyway. Luke dies, leaving no one to train Rey, but that's okay because the books that Yoda burned somehow made it onto the Falcon. The resistance is trapped in cave with only one way out and they lose the fight, but that's okay because there's another way out of the back that didn't exist before. Then you have Finn doing the one thing that gave his character real meaning. A decision that Finn made to put his fear aside to be the real hero and he commits himself and it's real and it's meaningful, but then Rose crashes into him and prevents it. And then somehow they make it from the middle of the plain surrounded by imperials with both of their vehicles completely destroyed, but somehow they beat the First Order back to the base and manage to escape with everyone else. Everything that was compelling and moving in this film was wasted with LAZY, LAZY, LAZY points of convenience. You can't throw that many ""coincidences"" into a film and expect anyone to find it meaningful. Everything that happened in this film cheapened the characters and their choices because nothing matters... some convenient coincidence will always be there to save the day. This is a mere fraction of the problems with this film."
"132",0.5,"  Could have a Star Wars movie gone worst than the Last Jedi? I don't think so. Plot holes everywhere, even impossible facts for being Star Wars are tremendously pathetic (See 'Mary Poppins in outer space' or 'The lion that starved to death because nyus were too cute'). Boring characters, zero respect for the original saga and extremely long. Seems that quality doesn't matter anymore, just do as much money as possible by going faster than the lightning releasing movies and introducing cute little creatures to sell them as toys; or even buying the critics to give them more box office. It is understandable tha kids and some people might like it, but someone with small knowledge in cinema can clearly distinguish that this movies is just awful. The half star is for the visual effects."
"133",2,"  Even after watching this movie a second time I just couldn't find any real value in it. It completely drifted away from what made Star Wars great and it feels like we're being fed a social justice diatribe on screen. Every villain is a white guy and every hero is a feminist or minority fighting against the 1%. I get that we should be trying to be inclusive, but this was so obviously forced. It's as if it was written specifically for the Hollywood elite to stroke their own conscience. I'm not saying we shouldn't cast minorities or women to be the hero's, I'm all in favor of that. But this movie goes beyond that and tries to stereotype every white male as bad and every minority as good. It gives the impression that women must be masculine to be hero's and white men are evil because, well hey they're white men!"
"134",0.5,"  bad ... really bad movie..."
"135",2,"  This is almost as bad as the episode 1-3. I hope they can bring the story back for episode 9 but I think they killed to much of the story."
"136",0.5,"  I went into this movie with high hopes. I am a gigantic Star Wars fan, and I love the Force Awakens. Rey was a personal favorite, yet I hoped to see Poe Dameron and Fin develop as characters. Instead, I received a nonsense plot that stifles the growth of the new characters I love.-Finn and Rose's storylines make no sense. None of he characters grow. -Rey is now Korra from Legend if Korra.-The movie manages to make Poe, a very level headed guy, out to be a bad guy for not listening to a crazy lady with purple hair.-Luke Skywalker gets plunked.-weird YodaNo one takes any responsibility in this movie, much like the corporate glutton hat spawned it. Literally a viewing experience that is more like ""The Room"", without being bad enough to be good. I am hoping JJ Abrams can fix this mess with he next installment."
"137",2,"  This movie is at the bottom of all the SW movies."
"138",4,"  As I look around the Internet and see fan reaction to ""The Last Jedi"" I get this general impression. Fans didn't like ""The Force Awakens"" because it was too similar. Now fans don't like ""The Last Jedi"" because it's too different. I definitely have my issues with some of the story logic and some of the scenes (one sequence in particularly was just so poorly conceived and executed). In general, however, I really liked this entry quite a bit. While I had many places I'd like to have gone, ideas I wanted for it, and to have my Star Wars fanboy desired fulfilled, I like how Rian Johnson played with and undercut expectations laying the ground for new, fresh stories for the Future of Star Wars. So far, I'd say the new movies, so far have hovered at ""The Return of the Jedi"" level of, good additions to the Star Wars franchise, but haven't transcended into excellent films the way the first ""Star Wars"", and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did."

"145",2,"  Messy, overlong, ungraceful, self-consciously right-on and overstuffed in the manner of big budget pictures nowadays, in a way the earlier films really weren't. It's made for a generation of moviegoers who care little about form and even less about storytelling, and that's a shame, because there are a handful of moments that stand among the best of the series. The woeful gambling planet is not one of them."
"146",1,"  Poor installment that does not hold up to the Star Wars franchise."
"147",5,"  Ranks with The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest Star Wars films of all time."
"148",0.5,"  Star Wars trilogy, at least from 1 to 7, are about the Skywalker family. The Last Jedi is something that did not make sense from the story plot point of view.I agree that it is one of the best graphic effects Star Wars movie, however i'm not looking just for that.In the end, this movie had no story logic."
"149",0.5,"  Horrible movie not Star Wars we love. Luke is a sniveling scared little man clearly in this is a movie. This is for feminists as it makes Luke a weak man. And make a female character the main character who's more powerful than anybody with little or no Jedi training. The plot is absolutely horrible and I will not go see episode 9. Rian Johnson who wrote and directed this film should be ashamed of himself it's a terrible movie."
"150",2,"  Movie just didnt flow well, casino planet was awful. They realy did a poor job with Lukes character. New chararters wwere not developed well at all. By far the worst of all the Star Wars films"
"151",0.5,"  I just need to add my personal impression to this movie, because Star Wars was (not ""is"" anymore) an epic fantasy saga with a lot of humanity and focused on characters.Now it is just some forgettable Marvelish Avengerish useless movie.Wait, some of those movies are actually good, but overall they are not at all close to any Star Wars movie, but this.Plot is very, very bad. Everything ""good"" in the movie is just a predictable copy-paste from the first trilogy. The new things are just horrible and make no sense.I could go deeper into details, but I feel it would be wasted time for this garbage.I had fun watching this, because I was with friends and we were actually enjoying laughing at every crap proposed. But then I slept over this and woken up just angry.Dislaimer: I am not at all an hater of any sort. I just like good things. This movie wasn't AND ruined the saga."
"152",2.5,"  Great great visual effects and cinematography, horrible script and storyline abandoned most of what was supposed to be built upon mafter episode 7. Couldn't get over the script failures and plethora of random scenes adding no value to the plot or the audiences understanding of the universe at large now"
"153",1,"  I couldn't find a way to give this movie zero stars, thus this is the only reason I'm even awarding it one. I actually made a stupid account on here JUST to write out how awful and terrible this movie was."
"154",2.5,"  Didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. There were some good parts, but overall probably one of the worse in the series."
"155",1,"  A true sign of the times, short attention span drivel."

"157",0.5,"  Not Star Wars. Mary Sure protagonist, poorly written story, disgracefulness in the the writing for Luke Skywalker as a character, and unlikable new cast of characters that are forgettable. The rest has been said already by many of the fans of this franchise, or like myself no longer a fan of the franchise."
"158",0.5,"  not good, not good at all"
"159",1,"  possibly the worst movie ever made. the only thing that redeems this is the cinematography.The story is just unworkable and inane."
"160",0.5,"  A shit stain by mary sue."
"161",1.5,"  Definitely the worst one. Being part of a saga demands to have come continuity between the movies before this one and in this case, it feels right from the first 5 minutes of the movie like an intent from the director to scratch over the movies before and try something new, even if in the process it could burn all the good stuff from before. It has just too many plot holes that can't be forgiven. It suggests viewers to go on an argument to leave it behind like trash consuming a lot of screen time. This movie has a lot of bad moments that don't fit in what you can consider a good movie, because frankly it's not."
"162",1,"  No pacing. No character development. Purposely destroyed original star wars. It looked good, but story was bad, characters are hollow, and they destroyed beloved characters for political reasons."
"163",0.5,"  This is Easily the worst Star Wars movie. It's a bad movie to begin with and if it wasn't a Star Wars movie, people would just ignore it mostly. But as it has expectations, money, and backstory invested in it, it's terrible and disappointing to the point of rage and depression and inducing."
"164",0.5,"  Oh boy, where to start: Star Wars used to be called a masterpiece, an entire universe rich with lore and story. There was the movies, games, books, and even the TV show: Star Wars: The Clone Wars that told the stories that jedi"

"168",2,"  Good visuals, but worst storytelling in star wars history"
"169",1.5,"  I'm extremely upset with what they did with Luke Skywalker. They made Poe look like an idiot and who the hell thought Rose was a good character"
"170",0.5,"  A horrible movie that was poorly written. Star Wars is not slapstick comedy."
"171",4.5,"  An excellent entry in the ever growing Star Wars saga by writer/director Rian Johnson, who manages to create the most beautiful shots in a Star Wars movie and is able to write a very interesting plot about what happened to the characters of the sequel trilogy while honoring the veterans that came before it. Brilliant music by John Williams improving on his previous 'Force Awakens' soundtrack. Brilliant performances from the entire cast, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill standing out as the best. The film pays respects to the legacy of the original trio and pushes them in an unexpected direction that fans who are open to change will be eager to see. Not without its problems the film is boggled down by Canto Bight scenes, not by the ideas, but by the execution. Rian Johnson is able to create excellent ideas but sometimes struggles to execute them well."
"172",0.5,"  I went to the European premiere dammit! At the Albert Hall! I talked to Daisy Ridley and that woman from Jurassic Park but fark me if I wasn't feeling superior the whole damn time. ""You idiots! You wasted Millions of dollars, thousands of people's time and a boat load of expensive catering for this?"" During the film, I found myself wandering the corridors of the Albert Hall, muttering ""It's the death of Star Wars"" under my breath as the treble filtered sounds of this absolute steaming pile wafted through to me via each balcony I passed. The worst thing it was was unfunny where they'd tried to be. Seriously? Comedy? In a Star Wars film? Did you not know about JAR JAR FARKIN' BINKS?! It's like all these people, so called captains of their industry are just children, walking around with monkeys playing cymbals in their brains as they try to pass off being grown ups to other moronic children with lots of money. I DO S*&%S WITH MORE ARTISTRY THAN THIS. Twats."
"173",0.5,"  This film is so incoherent and disjointed that I'd need a second viewing to even remotely understand what the heck is going on and why. But I'm not a sadist, so that's just not going to happen. How you go from TFA and Rogue One to this is beyond me. Kathleen Kennedy needs to step down and let someone else take the reigns, and Rain Johnson should never be allowed to even watch another Star Wars film, let alone direct one. Actually, he can keep watching this train wreck over and over, since he was the engineer steering it off the rails."
"174",0.5,"  total junk. now star wars is a mix if disney princess and dumb kid humor. rip star wars"
"175",0.5,"  As a lifelong star wars fan, this movie is an abomination, RIP STAR WARS."
"176",0.5,"  Rain Johnson was a scapegoat for Disney to perform culture shift take over. Star Wars has been a pop culture magnetic for central themes that are archetypes for societal norms/roles. That's why episode 7 was a copy of 4, draw us in/cash in., but most of it was thrown away in 8. The end goal wasn't about any fair treatment of the skywalker legacy, but - with contempt and arrogance- move past the old propaganda to their new. I can't believe Disney is this incompetent, this is a calculated risk with an expected bigger payoff.."
"177",4,"  The worst thing about the Star Wars movies are the FANS. They are the absolute worst!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, the movie is not without its flaws, but the mass amount of crybabies who insist on spending their time on the internet, trash talking the movie, instead of going outside and continuing to live their lives, is unreal.The Last Jedi is brave enough to show us something we haven't seen before, and that should be acknowledged. Yeah, they took Luke's story in a completely different direction, but still, Luke' story line is the best thing about the movie. Mark was incredible."
"178",0.5,"  Totally sucked, what's with movies today that are hugely over budget with a terrible story/plotline. Pathetic."
"179",1,"  Kathleen at Lucasfilm: HeY lady write me a star wars-movie where all the women are extremely brave and all the men are extremely stupid. Rianne director: I am not a lady! Kathleen: Whatever girlfriend, write and film! Rianne: shouldnot we think about what the viewers want to see? Kathleen: I told you I am not interested what viewers like. I am only interested in how the world should be in my view. Rianne: what do you mean? Kathleen: Well even though in REAL history men did all the fighting, all the dying, all the hard physical labor, in my reality they were really always the suppressors of all the womenfolk. Rianne: how.....? KAthleen: I didnot hire you to think, DO IT YOU SPINELESS MORON. Rianne: okay, okay. I will kill of this totally heroic dude I heard off called Luke in the most lame manner possible. Kathleen: love it already. Rianne: I wil do a ""Yo mamma"" joke. Kathleen: Love it. Can't you do a fart joke for the kids? Or something really dumb to cheer on for the kids? Rianne: sure. I have a few jokes. Throwing away lightsaber over shoulder by Luke: hilarious! Kathleen: Okay girlfriend. Do as i tell you and you can make a trilogy. Rianne: wow thanks., but i really have not seen all the earlier movies. Kathleen: whatever. I want all the men be jokes, be angry boys or worldwar 2 SS-guys. How hard can it be? Rianne: euhhh? Can i make this snoke ... Kathleen: No he is a bad man, some kind a starwars-Hitler, so he has to die silly. Rianne: why? Kathleen: cause all the men are some kinda Hitlers, do i have tot explain everything? Rianne: no, no, daddy, I mean momma.Phasma - female SS-leader. What does the viewer see: beautifull woman but totally unconvincing as a character. Motives: just wants to be mean in a shiny harnass? What is her driving force? But again an NPC who is killed of against an invincible lead character, no surprise here. 1-Dimensional character, the archetype is the ""evil"" person.Holdo - an heroic female admiral. What does the viewer see: An NPC who choses to help the cause by killing herself while destroying the capital ship of the enemy. Beautifull actress but why? Don't they have remotes in the future? We didnot get any chance to know her. Another a not so interesting NPC who is killed. Another heroic 1-dimensional character, there is no archetype."
"180",5,"  Love it, best Star Wars movie so far"
"181",0.5,"  The Emoji Movie has a better story line than this.."
"182",2.5,"  movie WAS OK, TOO BAD IT WAS TRYING TO PUSH A MESSAGE ABOUT ""OUR"" CURRENT ISSUES IN SOCIETY RATHER THEN MAKING A GOOD MOVIE. SAD BECAUSE THE SCENES WITH REY AND KILO ARE AMAZING."
"183",5,"  Watched it again today, it was perfect like the first time."
"184",1.5,"  this movie is an objectively bad movie. This is the result of a story with so much plotholes that it would make a good imatation for swiss cheese. Comedy that breaks the seriousness of every important character moment- A movie that doesn t respects continuity with the rest of the saga or even itself. Also we can note poor editing, useless characters and moments that break the universe rules. That rounded by a mary sue of a character has only three saving graces. the relation between kylo and rey, the awesome visuals and the porgs.......fucking porgs."
"185",1.5,"  This Disney trilogy feels like so much bad fan fiction."
"186",2.5,"  The movie honestly leaves you bewildered after the first billing. You are in awe because it is star wars, but also confused because it doesn't exactly read as starwars either. After multiple viewings, the negatives really weigh down the positives. The movie has a strong issue with pacing, character development and also the addition of unnecessary scenes and sub plots that don't really add to the main conflict of the story. Along with this there is a saturation of characters that do not fit the established star wars aesthetic, and seem to be there for the sake of representation and even politics outside of the franchise. Sadly the established characters also suffer, and instead feel like new characters who are only related to their former iterations by name, ie Luke. A heroic character like Luke still could of have been portrayed as someone despaired by tragedies and wants to break from old traditions, but the execution was poorly done. Lastly, the film feels like an end to a series instead of a middle film to a trilogy. And besides that, there isn't a strong continuation between 7 and 8 like their predecessors in the saga. The movie is still a beautiful example of cinematography in an artistic form stronger than previous films. Also if you focus generally on Rey and Kylo's tension, especially when confronted by Snoke, you will be captivated especially when considering the poetry of the past films that led up to their characters. Hoping for the best with the concluding film to this trilogy to bring back what made Star War really captivating."
"187",2.5,"  The force awakens was so much better. This sits way below expectations of any true Starwars fan!"
"188",1.5,"  I did enjoy some of this film but there was a lot that I really hated, not simply disliked but HATED. Luke has been turned into a morose, cowardly, murderous douche-bag who looks like Sam Kinison. Finn is still an unfunny, bumbling, coward that brings nothing to the story. Rey's character was improved in my opinion however overall the story is a downer, the whole side story of Finn and Rose running off to Casino Royale was dull and ultimately stupid, introducing Benicio Del Toro's character was pointless, those little pog things were annoying and a vein attempt to create new merchandising for Disney. Snoke and Rey's backstory's being shrugged away as nothing was lazy and... stupid! The space battles were cool but there's little to like in this smelly nugget of sci-fi fantasy. As soon as he shuffles out of this mortal coil Lucas will spin in his grave!"
"189",1,"  the whost star wars movie"
"190",0.5,"  This will be remembered as the skippable part of the new trilogy"
"191",0.5,"  Totally scratches everything TFA set up, or any other Star Wars movie for that matter."
"192",5,"  The Last Jedi is amazing! Rian Johnson is a master story teller. I'm tired of all these fan boys who grew up loving star wars just wanting to re-live their childhood. It's time to grow up fanboys. From the heart stopping action to the compelling characters that Rian Johnson took to the next level, this movie really takes Star Wars from the old and into the new. Not looking forward to Episode IX cause J.J. will just ruin it again. Can't wait for the new trilogy from Rian Johnson. Just imagine what he will be able to do without being constrained to the Star Wars Universe like he was in this movie."
"193",1,"  id rather watch transformers"
"194",0.5,"  A steaming pile of bantha doo-doo. Random characters played by charismatic actors go nowhere. Holds a plot like a sieve holds water. Scenario after scenario, battle after battle, cliche after cliche."

"199",3.5,"  On the whole a very enjoyable film, but not without many flaws. I appreciate where some of the new directions were trying to go but it was the execution that didn't work all too well for me. In the end though, the good stuff overshadows the bad."
"200",0.5,"  ME PARECI√ì UN ASCO DE LA PEL√çCULA"
"201",2,"  While the visual effects are amazing and visually stunning, the same can not be said for the story. The movie doesn't add anything to the star wars lore, in fact does the opposite and destroys several ideas behind the first six movies and series such as the clone wars. The movie plot is lazy and disappointing. They just miss the opportunity to have created a great movie."
"202",1,"  Kennedy, Johnson and Disney ruined a sure thing! Enough said!!!"
"203",1,"  Metaphorically speaking, this film is a pile of poop. How smelly or unsightly? It doesn't matter; it's a pile of poop. I regret waking up early on a Saturday morning to watch the 6:00 am showing."
"204",0.5,"  The more i think about this film the more I hate it. Too many plot holes, terrible jokes, no character development, idiot commanders like Hux, laughable villians, leila poppins.... i could go on and on. Makes me angry that someone could make such a bad movie and ruin the star wars legacy. V"
"205",0.5,"  Rian johnson not only shit on the legacy characters, he threw away anything abrams set up. mostly he did give any characters to any of the characters that all could be great characters played by the same cast. not even saying she should not have directed it, but he absolutely should not have wrote the movie."
"206",3.5,"  you need to give it 4 in a half stars thank you."
"207",4,"  I loved it. Screw you guys, I'm going home (In Eric Cartman voice)."

"210",0.5,"  Is there any good about this film?Nothing significant enough to mention..."
"211",4,"  Good story - classic - but....dont agree with how Luke was portrayed."
"212",0.5,"  Bad trash, even prequel 3 was better than this."
"213",0.5,"  Bad story telling, nonsensical plot, poor characters, one missed opportunity after another. All these I can forgive. What I can't forgive is the shameful mishandling of the Star Wars universe and particularly of its beloved iconic characters. Luke is pathetic in this movie. He's not Luke - he is Star Wars - I can understand why he needs to be out of the way to tell the next chapter, but he should have died a hero, he should have died with a noble sacrifice. Star Wars operates on the level of archetype, it's why it has such a broad cultural appeal, it's why the characters are beloved and celebrated. It's about the hero's journey, the noble sacrifice, good vs evil.The writing and direction utterly failed in this movie. Disney, and particularly JJ and Rian, lack the creative vision to do Star Wars, they're just milking it for money at this point.This movie is downright offensive to the Star Wars universe. I don't understand how it was even approved to be made. The incompetence is strong in these ones."
"214",0.5,"  Disney ruined this movie pushing its political agenda. Enough said."
"215",0.5,"  Absolutely horrible. Tons of plot holes, lazy story telling, American social justice queues that have no relevance to the series, virtue signaling, awkward comedic humor severely date the film. Plus, superman Leia is just comical. I'm sorry Mark Hamill. Kathleen Kennedy is a cancer to this series."
"216",1,"  The story is a total mess, for starters. It's packed with narrative holes and leaden dialogue, and the whole enterprise is hopelessly trapped inside a tortuous series of incompatible timelines that stretch credibility well beyond anything that even setting the story in a galaxy far, far away can excuse.The film's tone is all over the place, too, switching horribly awkwardly between (usually painfully lame) humor, serious 'Force stuff' and lots of people dying without even trying to establish any sort of context for its changing moods.Dull, messy scripts can sometimes be rescued by great direction. But sadly, despite his enjoyable efforts with Looper, writer/director Rian Johnson consistently fluffs the job of filming his own words.Tense scenes fail to build tension. Dramatic scenes deliver no drama. Emotionally charged scenes lack emotional charge. Fight scenes look horribly stilted and leaden. Jokes generally feel so labored or are delivered so abruptly that they feel more like a slap in the face than something that might actually make you laugh.I really can't think of a single important scene where you get any sense that Johnson understands how to use imagery to add power to the film's generally underwhelming events.The Last Jedi's many filmmaking fails left me with almost nothing I could latch on to in order to become immersed in the action, leaving me desperate for the whole dull mess to come to an end at least an hour before it did. And once the criminally drab conclusion was finally reached, I couldn't help but find myself comparing The Last Jedi with Alien 3 in terms of its franchise-crushing awfulness."
"217",0.5,"  probably the last Star Wars movie for me, not going to lie, worst Star Wars movie ever, bad movie telling in general, and I am not interested in seeing one of my favorite thing turned shitty"
"218",0.5,"  Disney you are flying to hell first class at full speed. Ryan Johnson I hope you die of bleeding ass warts."
"219",0.5,"  Plot holes so large you'd think it was alderaan"
"220",0.5,"  I've been a Star Wars fan sense I was 5, I couldn't even finish this shitty film, it insults the legacy of all the hero's of the original series, it's overtly sexist and the characters are painfully unrelatable. Then Mary Sue perfect at everything with no effort at all Ray is just a juggernaut of plot armored stupidity. I use to hate the prequels but now i think they deserve a second look at least the plot was good."
"221",1,"  This movie isn't Star Wars.It'll be the Last Time i spend money on Star Wars movies.Nowadays if it's not Dave Folani its not Star Wars."
"222",1.5,"  I saw The Last Jedi from a bootleg source. There was no way I was going to spend twenty dollars to see this in a movie theater after all of the bad reviews in received from the fans. With that in mind I have to admit the movie was passable enough as a science fiction fantasy movie and not nearly as bad as the You-tubers were making it out to be. But to be honest , The Last Jedi is not a good Star Wars movie."
"223",5,"  An amazing sw movie. I SAW it 3 times in the cinemas, Im looking forward to rian johnsons trilogy."
"224",1,"  A thrilling sequel to Star Wars: The force awakens and long awaited, only to fall extremely short of almost everything that makes it ""Star Wars."" The movie had ever slightly better pacing and even worst dialogue. The movie focuses on a more comedic aspect and falls short even on that note and even kills off one of the better characters only for that to fail the audience as a beloved character doesn't receive a death he deserves. The only good thing are the visuals and the fact Star Wars is in the title, oh and don't forgot the laser swords that can be so easily learned that anyone could do it.."
"225",0.5,"  Waste of money. I have never despised a film more than this one. It's comparable to that recent perversion of King Arthur."
"226",1,"  Az utolsÛ Star Wars, amit megn√©ztem."
"227",4,"  A well paced, well shot, well acted film that's a blast to watch"
"228",2,"  The script is really only a bit above adequate in this film. Humor attempt was awkward, ill placed and political sub themes were so flipping annoying. It's like a virus in films we can't get rid of now. What bothered me most was Luke looking like he'd been hitting the bottle a bit too much atop his retreat. There was one scene I loved where Luke got excited to see R2 and it was great watching him again. Then he sunk into this deep voice that drove me nuts - yeah, he was old but old Ben still looked sober at least. I think most people agree you CAN follow up a great film with a great film (Empire Strikes Back) but it clearly didn't happen here. Who approves these final cuts of the film is what I want to know and why would they do this after such a great film like the Force Awakens?"
"229",1,"  worse movie in star wars history"
"230",1,"  The final nail in the coffin that made me quit whatever StarWars, that Disney puts out. Just like I quit Star Trek.At the moment I am perfectly fine with reading any StarWars book published pre-2012, before watching any of these feminist-infected logic-deprived SJW-trash filled with character-assassinations of any known male. I was appalled that they weren't even subtle about what their agenda was. Force Awakens was at least watchable.2 months before watching this in december I began to see the signs after classifying the structure that these people uses to base their story around. Because they don't care about keeping inside the boundary of established lore or create characters that has exciting and interesting challenges to overcome and grow from. Both inside and outside.SJW's has an idea that they want to show women as morally superior in any way, while men being brutish and wrong, even though they actually have a point.But that is not all. Every decision for this movie's story was completely retarded and it wasted every interesting plotline and characters to the point of stupidity. And that is not counting Luke Skywalker's 180 degree change in his personality without any reasonable justification other than to tell a joke and make the main character of Rey being even more morally superior than she already is. Everything was so dull.The movie effectively killed off anything that was interesting in StarWars(from Force Awakens) to the point that there is absolutely no reason to watch it anymore.But it is all okay, I believe. Even though they wasted the opportunity to having Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford back in these movie, this will stand as a testimony of how to not treat a franchise as the market balances itself out, and no one caring anymore whenever Disney puts out more StarWars.I will be fine reading through loads of books from the legends canon, knowing that it can only be much better than this crap. Maybe in 10 - 15 years, StarWars will come back in the way it should be...Untill then, I will do other stuff :D"
"231",1.5,"  Fun Star Wars movie but epitome of style over substance. Not a good entry into the universe but enjoyable if you don't mind that it ruins the star wars universe"
"232",0.5,"  when I went in to see this film opening night I was excited to see Luke Skywalker return, I was ready to see space battles and lightsaber fights, I was ready to see a good movie. What I got was a MASSIVE disappointment the story was all over the place, Rey was a Mary Sue, the casino planet was unnecessary to the plot, Luke Skywalker dying enraged me, and the fact that the purple haired leader couldn't tell Po the plan because he was a hot shot is the worst reason I have ever heard of. The First Order's military leaders who are supposed to be a representation of the Nazi's who fled to South American and regrouped don't have any competent leaders in their ranks. Whats worse the comedy derails the plot on several occasions and hurts the serious tone that the movie is going for. Now a few subtle jokes from C3P0 and Chewbacca would have been fine but to have as many ""jokes"" that the movie did I thought I was trying to be a bad sequel to Space Balls. Also as this was the final film with Carrie Fisher I felt as though it would have been better if Leia died in the attack on the main bridge of the ship. It would have been a huge emotional blow to the audience and it would have had an impact on the characters in the movie, instead they pulled a Mary Poppins out of no where showing she has force powers that are equal to that of Luke despite the fact she never had any official force training, this turns an emotional death scene that would have surpassed the death of Han Solo and it would show that this movie had balls. Instead the film decided that ""Nope we are going to keep her alive for no reason other than the fact that we want her to live and kill Luke off because we want him t die."" I am disappointed with Disney and I am disappointed with Cathleen Kennedy as they should have written a better script and take a page out of the two previous trilogies for how to write a proper script.This movie is on the same level as a bad fanfiction. -10/10 will not buy the DVD or Blu-Ray, do not recommend anyone to see."
"233",1,"  Horrible...Worst SW ever made....Complete garbage...Rian Johnson and Kathy K killed this franchise.."
"234",3.5,"  Far from the best Star Wars film (the worst of the non-prequels, no question), and the franchise is getting a bit over-the-top, but it's still a good work."
"235",1.5,"  Cool special effects and music. Terrible story and plot holes. Luke was not the Luke he should have been. Luke the Redeemer is going to kill his nephew because he thinks he is going to the dark side. WTF Anyways terrible except for a few bright spots. Rey is cool and kylo and snoke are terrible and not in the good way."
"236",0.5,"  By far the worst Star Wars movie ever. The entire scene where Fin goes to the casino to save the racehorses was a complete waste of time. Purple-hair-lady-general refusing to tell Poe the plan made zero sense. And, worst of all, they destroyed Like as a character. I could go on, but this short tirade covers a few of the major problems. Star Wars is dead."
"237",0.5,"  I have never been more angry and disappointed after seeing a movie. Terrible script that ruins characters that were my idols growing up. I have always loved star wars and this felt like a big middle finger. There is so many plot holes and this movie honestly breaks the lore of the entire franchise."
"238",0.5,"  Disney destroys my childhood wiith this one."
"239",5,"  this movie is amazing"
"240",5,"  I Totally loved it! It's the best Star Wars Film."
"241",0.5,"  Rian Johnson has successfully changed the landscape of Star Wars forever. While that may be great for some including critics it's very bad for others. Star Wars is a franchise that is built on the backs of it's fans most of whom have followed the franchise for 40 years. These same fans have introduced this franchise to their children also. Kylo REn pretty much sums up what Rian Johnson has done when he makes the statement ""Kill the past"" You can make good Star Wars movies without destroying what people already know and love. I wont even get into the fact that Rey is a Mary Sue. THat Leia is superman. Or any of the SJW stuff that was throughout this film. Fact still remains that the movie is making a killing This movie has made a billion dollars on the backs of the people that this movie slaps in the face.if i had three hands I would give it three thumbs down but I only have two so two thumbs downThis is not the star wars you grew up on its more Hunger games meets Battlestar Galactica"
"242",0.5,"  I've lost count of critikal Youtube videos out there.But one thing is certain, they all agree that Kathleen Kennedy and her ideology is the problem."
"243",1,"  Totally inept and incompetent film-making. How such a ridiculous and nonsensical script ever got the green light is beyond me. As a movie, it's utter garbage; as a STAR WARS movie, it's an abomination. Do yourself a favor and avoid this tripe. In fact, you would be doing yourself a huge favor by avoiding everything produced by Hollywood, turning off the TV, and reading books instead."
"244",1,"  Best cinematic qualities of all Star Wars films. Story lines were weakest of any SW film. The character development was very weak and unconvincing. The actors and actresses were excellent but the chemistry between each was in my opinion worse than the original trilogy but much better than the prequels. This should have been a standalone movie and separate from any particular trilogy or saga. Did not have the feel of a Star Wars movie. Sad. Wasted the character of Luke. I'm not mad because of his death but rather the poor story arc leading to this event. It should have been developed more and happened in the episode 9."
"245",4,"  Unique Action sequences with many surprising surprises and twisting endings."
"246",0.5,"  Easily the second worst film in the franchise."
"247",1,"  This was the worst star wars movie I ever seen! Rian Johnson it is very clear he is not a good writer and he needed a co-writer for the movie. The plot holes are uncountable, the editing of the movie was very bad and sloppy, the scene with Finn meets Rose for the first time, Finn is about to enter a pod he place his bag outside the pod, when Rose talks to him, some how the bag gets inside the pot but worst on top of a chair lol. This is a very bad movie. Then they killed off Luke Skywalker, with an unreasonable reason projecting an image of himself kills him. Then they made Luke be a person who turn his back on the Force, and his friends and family. This image of Luke is hard to accept it like Captain American turn his back on America and start killing American citizens. Or like Superman turn his back on Lewis, and leave her to die when he can save her. The Last Jedi is the far worst Star Wars movie even though it had a big budget, and fancy visual it writing and plot fell through the roof. This why it has a low audience score. Then Finn in TFA Finn appeared he might be force senstive, why did he leave the first order what made him turn in TLJ this is ignored, and he was turned into a side character who did not even have no importance to the main plot. In the promotion of the Last Jedi they was showing Finn had a new blaster, he did not even use the blaster one time! Ouch! The Last Jedi was a lot of money invested in an non-experience writer and director, they should used someone more experiences like Spielberg or Ron Howard."
"248",1,"  terrible story, writing, and acting. The plot is poorly devised. It is sad that characters I've known for years turn up in terrible plot and story. This is very much similar to the three amigos 'those darn amigos'."
"249",1.5,"  The only good parts in this movie had to do with Luke and Rey. All the other new characters were terrible. Poe is the new Jar Jar Binks, except Jar Jar was a more competent commander. Leia and purple haired Laura Dern are the worst military minds ever. They don't share information with their underlings, leading to resentment and mutiny and then they laugh it off because Poe is cute. This move sets back women's rights 1000 years.This movie supposedly took risks. BS. If they really wanted to take a risk they would have killed off Finn in the part where Rose saves him because she's everything she despises. Finn's character would have gone through an amazing arc, actually giving a damn and sacrificing himself. Rose's character is pointless. Finn and Rose's wild adventure is pointless. The plotline of this movie is pointless.There were better plotline ideas on youtube channels than what actually came to pass here. Shame."
"250",1,"  Utter rubbish on so many levels. A real disappointment."
"251",1.5,"  Cinematography, lighting, costumes all wonderful. But this film did not preform good in believable character development, continuing a story smoothly, holding true to established rules from the new cannon, answering any questions established prior, and giving the audience a real reason to care about any new characters. The story falls flat with M. Night Shyamalan style twists that do not make you believe them. It is obvious that the director wanted to flaunt artistic flair but this flair was shallow and skin deep. If you take this film as an infinities of Star Wars it might be ok but in cannon it is utter trash disregarding everything but it's self. Bringing you incredible landscapes and scenes only to destroy them in order to shock you with lazy writing or cop outs. Plot demands personality changes that are unnatural for characters well established. This film really does just throw away everything you care about worse than Game of Thrones. Though Game of Thrones actually has a cohesive story and arcs most of the time where the last Jedi fails to even do that. . I recommend this film to anyone who want to know if they should bother with Star Wars anymore. The Last Jedi will give you a very loud in your face reason to never touch our beloved Star Wars again. I hope that Disney sees reason soon and changes something to make our Star Wars awesome again."
"252",0.5,"  not good. seemed disconnected from the previous. plus the fact that 1/10 of the actors were women. all the leaders, all the soldiers, and all the bad guys were white males. Jack shit. Lets not forget who put an end to the real nazis"
"253",1.5,"  Walked out the cinema, did no know what to think. The more I thought about it the worse it became. Never had a reaction to a movie like this in my life. A slow chase movie with amazing visuals & massive plot holes, plus pointless side quests. Amature story telling at best. I don't care about anyone in this movie. Love or hate. Useless.."
"254",0.5,"  So many point (many already stated)Cons- Luke Skywalker ending, and character let down. Organa Solo let down. - No real villains left, No real character develeopement- Major plot holes (a chase that didn't need to be a chase, possible quicker ending that could have saved lives)- Unnecessary plot detours (ya... that casino part -_-)Pros: - Special effects"
"255",0.5,"  Star wars the last feminist is the biggest disgrace to the star wars franchise as a whole. It honestly felt like a parody of star wars with a forced diversity agenda. There was a strong level of feminism throughout blatantly labeling men as stupid and reckless imbeciles. I feel like Rian Johnson has never even watched a star wars movie before because nothing about his film has a resemblance. There wasn't even a lightsaber duel in a 3 hour star wars film....... are you freaking dumb rian? My only last wish is that Disney drops the star wars rights because they have ruined it for mostly everyone. Congrats.Update :I just hope people don't get fooled by these 5 star reviews and waste their time watching this film. I hope the cunt that produced this movie loses rights immediately."
"256",0.5,"  This is one of the worst movies ever. The story doesn't make any sense. There are a lot of plot holes. This movie is worse than dragon ball evolution. Disney needs to do something about the future of Star Wars."
"257",1,"  I don't know what was they doing when they wrote the script, but i imagine that's involve some kind of heavy drugs"
"258",0.5,"  Did not like it at all. Too many holes in the plot, characters act like idiots, the villain doesn't have a charisma whatsoever. I loved the original movies, I liked the next three. But now the franchise is going down in flames. Won't even waste my time watching the next movie."
"259",0.5,"  What was that???? Cheesy writing and terrible plot full of holes. Zero character development along with character assassination! Do you think people want to see Luke die??? No battle, no vengeance for Han? No depth at all.... terrible. I feel like I got robbed. Could have been so great but NOPE!!!"
"260",0.5,"  This is a very disappointing movie. It's totally out of context with the legacy of Star Wars and contradicts itself throughout the movie. The character development had tons of potential but they turned out to be as shallow as a cartoon and the writing is cringe worthy. It ruined the legacy and my interest in Star Wars from this point forward. Half a star because it did look good sometimes."
"261",2,"  In trying to make a Star Wars film that subverts the fans' expectations Rian Johnson seems to have forgotten that he is making the second film in a trilogy series. The Last Jedi forgets or disregards many of the seemingly important plot points set up by its predecessor and where it does link up to The Force Awakens it does so with a brazen capriciousness that gets to be predictable in it's own right. From mishandled characters and inconsequential sub plots to jokes that seem out of place in a galaxy far far away Star Wars fans deserve better. Disney seems to have purchased the Mona Lisa with the intent of finger painting over it."
"262",5,"  A great star wars flim"
"263",0.5,"  Extremely disappointing. I like where they were going with Rey and Kylo, then nothing... Finally we get to see Snoke and then nothing... Finn and Rose story arc was completely pointless and made very little sense. Luke has been developing for 40+ years, and all of a sudden everything we thought we knew goes out the window. And my dear Carrie Fisher was turned into a joke. Rian Johnson has no respect for fans or the universe that was built. He was handed a golden canvas and wiped his ass with it. Oh my god the schtick comedy was over the top and out of place, cringe at best. Trying way too hard to force comedic moments, and i swear there were a few times they obviously paused for laughs. Nothing Luke did in this film in character, it was so far out of character you were left scratching your head. Easily the worst piece of SW canon ever conceived. I encourage all to watch at least once to form your own oponion, but expect to be disappointed. This is where Star Wars dies, and aside from from re shooting and re writing 75% of the movie to release a ""directors"" cut or whatever you want to call it. Episode IX can't reverse this. It hurts to see our/my childhood bastardized and so disrespected. Hopefully we will get a proper episode VIII, until then I will take comfort in the og trilogy and Rogue One. May the force be with anyone who can fix this abomination."

"266",0.5,"  Nada original, pobre guion y personajes nada interesantes"
"267",2,"  As a fan growing up watching the original trilogy I was so disappointed with The Last Jedi. The film rips up every plot line from The Force Awakens and totally destroys the character of Luke Skywalker!An amazing achievement. Looks like they are writing stories for a different audience now, congratulations Disney, I'm out!"

I also tried to convince my friend that didn't like the film that it wasn't that bad then I realized that really is a bad film.The biggest problem I have for this film is that it could just have been a stand alone film because they didn't really care what happened in the force awakens. the last jedi had so much potential but didn't do anything with it."
"273",5,"  ""Wahhh it didn't go the way I wanted and a girl was the star""-All the 1 star reviews.This movie was brilliantly directed. Most of the issues people have are because they built up all these theories in their head for no reason, then the movie didn't line up. If you want a male-centered star wars, and that is your priority, that exists.If you want a nostalgic star wars, that exists.If you want predictable star wars, that exists.If you want boring backstory star wars, that exists.If you want something new, entertaining, and intelligent, this is the star wars movie for you.This movie was awesome, the only issue was a couple plot points left hanging, but this is the 2nd movie of a sequel...so what do you expect?Go see it."

"282",2,"  I love Star Wars. I enjoy many different styles and types of movies in general. This was a terrible movie in terms of the Star Wars mythology and in terms of a stand alone movie ... really bad. It's just a terrible movie with big special effects."
"283",2,"  I grew up with the original trilogy. After an initial 32 year waiting to see luke and getting ripped off by force awakens, then another two to see him in his full glory, we get the last jedi. not only were there no big space battles, let a lone a bona fides lightsaber fight or two, but luke is, to put it too politely, underwhelming. This movie elevated the prequels, and vaulted return of the jedi to the best one of the eight episodes simply because of the missed opportunity with luke. what a shame. it did have some good individual moments and a good soundtrack. my interest in episode iX & beyond is minimal because of this movie."
"284",0.5,"  I am fighting back tears. Disney has raped, pillaged, and sucked every ounce of sci-fi originality from a once revered and vibrant masterpiece."
"285",1,"  Shockingly BAD. I am not paying to see anymore star wars movies. The throwing of the saber, the Milking fish,the lame Mary Poppins bit, that pointless casino storyline. Really ruined the Skywalker Saga. Its over."
"286",3,"  SPOILER ALERT: I'm a huge Star Wars fan but it's not like all the Star Wars movies are going to be flawless masterpieces every time they are released. The Last Jedi is a good movie. It's not great, it's definitely not the best Star Wars movie since Empire. There are some things that The Last Jedi does that The Force Awakens didn't do well and vice versa. In this movie, while there are similarities other Star Wars movies, does not copy paste huge plot points from the previous films and slightly change it. This whole story is a breath of fresh air when it comes to Star Wars. I liked almost everything in this movie but the reason why I'm not giving it a higher rating is that the problems in this movie, granted there are only a few, are huge. There is a 20-minute scene on a planet called Canto bight (I think that's how it's spelled) in a casino and I hated it. It doesn't feel like Star Wars, it feels like something I'd see in Guardians of The Galaxy or, dare I say it, Valerian. It was just done so poorly. The only other thing that I thought was kind of stupid, even stupid for Star Wars, was Leia floating in space. That was just plain dumb. I was also not a fan of the really cheesy and forced love story between Finn and Rose. Kelly Marie Tran isn't a very good actress either. But there are some things that I really did love in this movie. I loved the Rey and Kylo fight scene, I loved Snoke's death right before that and Luke was really amazing in this movie. I've seen this movie four times at this point and it's taken me a lot of thinking to finally come up with a score but this film is a low 7/10. The Force Awakens is probably also a 7/10."
"287",1,"  NOTE: Apparently RottenTomatoes doesnt count 1/2 star or zero star ratings, make sure you give this movie ONE STAR to be counted. There is something REALLY fishy going on with the reviews on this movie. Disney is DEFINITELY paying or influencing the reviews. MAKE YOUR VOICE COUNT AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.Review of Social Justice Wars : The Last Mary Sue & the Diversity Crew:I remember watching The Phantom Menace as a 17 year old when it first came out and thinking ""wow, there is no way any future Star Wars movie could possibly be worse than this"".But the universe, in all its infinite wisdom & patience, just laughed, and nearly 18 years later, an took the older, wearier, and more tired version of me and subjected him to this abortion of a film.Where to begin? let me try to go in order:1) Opening space battle: despite losing the Death Stars to small fighters, and having fought the Rebellion for 30+ years, the First Orders commanders are utterly unprepared when a single fighter manages to sneak past their big canons and severly damage their biggest dreadnought. Snoke was apparently unaware his capital ship, that he is on, now has a device that can track the Rebel fleet through hyperspace. Apparently the Galaxy Far Far away does not bother with gravity and vacuum, as the Rebel bombers literally ""drop"" bombs ""down"" in space. And the only way to release said bombs is with a remote control, one that is easily dropped, lost, or fumbled. Poe made a prank call to open up the movie.... HILARIOUS right!??2) Plot : what, in the name of all that is holy, was the point of that IDIOTIC Finn/Asian chick side quest? Not only did the out of place Casino planet fee straight out of a James Bond movie and UTTERLY took me out of the film (tuxedos, dice, popular Earth gambling games, etc), the entire side quest was COMPLETELY POINTLESS and served no purpose other than to give the two minority characters something to do. And when the hell did Rose fall in love with Finn? In the in-universe few HOURS they were together? Also according to the #MeToo movement, isnt Rose kissing Finn while he was almost passed out now considered ""Sexual Assault""? Imagine if Finn did that to Rose? And if the whole quest was to get in contact with a super rare Code Breaker (too bad they don't have R2 D2), what are the chances they would just HAPPEN to be locked in with an equally competent code breaker just in time to escape together? 3) Excessive SJW/Feminist/Political correctness. If I walk into a room and theres me (middle eastern), an African American, an Asian, a Jew, and a gay person (all mixed genders), great! No problem. Its when its artificially shoved down our throats and forced that it becomes an issue. Rose has no reason for existing other that to have an Asian character and fill in the diversity quota. She adds exactly zero to the plot and her removal would make no difference what so ever. Admiral Holdo is, in the most ham fisted literal sense, the purple haired, physical manifestation of modern day toxic feminism. She literally has purple hair, and her entire purpose to is put the ""mansplaining"" hot shot Poe in his place and to show that, despite her being completely and utterly stupid and irrational by any standard, she really isn't at all, and that this proves that all women really are rational, even when they are not. And its just men keeping them down! Speaking of which, apparently all competent leaders in this new Star Wars are women, and all the bumbling, incompetent ones are white stuffy men.4) The ""hyperspace ram"" scene. Oh my god this single scene just made the entire Star Wars saga completely and utterly irrelevant:A New Hope: ""Sir, we just analyzed the Death Star plans and devised a risky assault plan....""Just hyperspace ram it""ESB: ""Sir, our troops are assembled and ready to commence the ground assault against the Rebel base....""""Just hyperspace ram the Shield Generator, then hyperspace ram the Rebel base""Return of the Jedi : ""Sir, the Death Star is just ahead and we are preparing our fleet to....""""Just hyperspace ram the Death Star""""But sir, its protected by an energy shield from the Forest Moon of Endor""""Hyperspace Ram the Shield generator, then hyperspace ram the Death Star""Rogue One: ""We have the Death Star plans, but we need to deactivate the shield in order to be able to transmit it to the....""""Just hyperspace ram the shields until they are.... actually we can just hyperspace ram the Death Star anyways. I guess we dont need those plans after all, ok guys lets go home""Besides directly making all of the above completely irrelevant, what happens in this new Disney Star Wars universe if a pilot falls asleep on the wheel and accidentally hyperspace rams a planet? What if he was checking his Twitter while piloting? or a disgruntled former employee? A terrorist?Speaking of the Death Stars too, why build such an expensive space station when you can just strap on a hyperdrive to random asteroid and hyperspace it into a planet? Much more cost effective and same exact effect, no?Finally, why did ""Admiral"" Holdo wait until the very LAST REBEL ship to hyperspace ram the Capital ship of the New Order? She sacrificed like, what, a dozen Rebel ships before she apparently came up with that brilliant idea? I'm guessing the purple hair dye seeped into her brain, or maybe it was just the patriarchy holding her down. Who knows?5) Luke Skywalker. Now here is a man, who, at the tender young age of his early 20s, was plucked out of obscurity from a remote desert planet, and, despite everyone and their mothers telling him otherwise, decides that Darth Vader, the notorious mass murderer and the Emperor's right hand man, had some good in him, and he bravely went and confronted him not once, but TWICE. Where is this hero? Apparently broken and defeated because a barrel chested angsty teenager got a little mad at him, forcing him to abandon his friends, family, and all he has ever fought for and sulk like a coward milking some kind of space cows. Fruthermore, whats the point of the ghost projection at the end if he was going to die anyways? Why not go there as a man worthy of the Luke Skywalker legend? I have no problem with characters changing, thats fine. Its how the story teller TAKES that character there is what counts. To take someone like Luke and have him turn into a sulking coward, you have to EARN the right to that to him by exceptional story telling. 6) Rey ""Mary Sue"". Please keep in mind that in the in-universe timeline, Mary Sue was, at best, a week removed from her escape from Jakku. In that short amount of time, somehow she manages to 1) defeat Luke skywalker in an impromptu melee, 2) Defeat Snoke's Elite bodyguards in a grossly over matched setting, 3) use the Force competently enough to defeat Kylo Ren, who has presumably been training since childhood, 4) and outfly trained TIE Fighter pilots, among many other super human feats. 5) Know how to swim.... after living her entire life on a desert planet. Anakin Skywalker, who was ""too old"" at 9 years old to even begin training, must be jealous. Luke, the son of the prodigal Anakin Skywalker, had to struggle to even move a lightsaber and spent months on a swamp planet with a dyslexic talking frog just to learn the basics of the Force, and got his hand chopped off for his efforts.7) The entire plot revolves around the FO fleet slowwwwly crawl up to the escaping Resistance fleet. First of all, why does light (laser beams) ""lose power"" over the distance of a few kilometers in vacuum? And since when do Star Wars ships ""use fuel"" when in the still canonical cross section books even the oldest Republic Era capital ships were powered by ""massive fusion generators that generate more power than a star""? Just to serve a contrived and boring plot point and give a movie something to make it last 2 hours? Did the Death Star have to stop by a gigantic Chevron gas station in space on its way to blow up Alderaan? Hopefully Tarkin let the Stormtroopers use the bathrooms and grab some snacks real quick. Is Pablo Hidalgo still around to make sure consistency in the SW canon is maintained? Or is it now the ""Kathleen Kennedy **** show""?8) The entire Resistance is apparently comprised of a few hundred people. For an entire galaxy of quintillion beings. Apparently the Resistance capital ships have a population density less than that of your average crack house. Just how 12 is Rian Johnson exactly? And why is the only way to send a message to their allies on that old Rebel base? no one has an iphone? They managed to contact Maz just fine before.8 ) Snoke.... why kill off the single most interesting new bad guy? Space Leia... why? The third leg on those Rebel speeds on the planet Crayt that create a very visually distinct red trail easily trackable by the enemy....why? The resistance keeping the base door open until the last second causing needless casualties....why? How did that Code breaker even know of the Rebel plans? Finn and Rose left before anyone even knew what the plans even were. Who told him? Who told Finn/ Rose? Speaking of the Dynamic Diversity Duo, how did they manage to make it back to the Rebel base on Crayt so quickly, without getting shot at by the AT-AT walkers, once their speeders crashed? DOES THIS MOVIE EVEN STAY CONSISTENT TO ITS OWN SELF?The entire existence of this movie, which removed any and all interesting characters and mysteries (Snoke, Reys parents, Luke, etc) introduced in Force Awakens. Why? What about the Knights of Ren, CLEARLY shown in the Force Awakens as being part of the destruction of Lukes Jedi Academy? The level of carelessness in constructing a coherent, consistent trilogy is astounding. I would not be surprised in the slightest if I found out Rian Johnson never even watched the Force Awakens, or at best was given a rough outline of what happened in it.In short.... congratulations Universe. You win again.Not just the worst Star Wars movie ever, but honestly just one of the worst movies in general.Rian Johnson is just an edgy douche bag who clearly enjoys taking what he knows people like and expect and just going the complete opposite way just to be a contrarian jack ass, If that's all Disney wanted they could have just made Luke Skywalker be the leader of a group of space faring Force using Unicorns who are the reincarnated Jedi masters of the past and shoot lasers out of their horns. Even less people would have expected that so it HAS to be good, right?Kathleen Kennedy is a well know hardcore feminist idiot. Now that old white dude Lucas is not the boss anymore, Kathleen is having a field day shoving her toxic neo-feminist garbage down our throats.Please don't support this film. Don't support Disney. They are the epitome of a soulless corporation that specializes in mass producing generic, unimaginative digital content and overcrowded, overpriced theme parts. They need to learn their lesson and not be the arrogant corporation they are, and go back to their roots. RT is not calculating the REAL scores of this film correctly. Its audience approval is WAY less than 49%, and the fake ""five star"" reviews are barely one or two sentences long. All the professional critics paid off or intimated by Disney are now exposed and will lose a TON of credibility in their future reviews.This is just a MESS. It takes a special kind of idiot to be able to ruin an established franchise like Star Wars in such a way, and Rian Johnson is exactly that idiot."
"288",2,"  While The Last Jedi took risks, it suffered because of them. The Finn and Rose Arc was unnecessary and a waste of time. Making Luke wait 2/3 of the way through the movie to accept his call to action is a waste of his and ultimately Rey's Character progression. The movie is a good generic Sci-fi film but not a great entry in the Star Wars Saga. A waste of Mark Hamill's talent and a waste of Luke as the character we knew him as. While The movie has it's merits, it has too much slap stick comedy and plotholes that make it unsuccessful. 30 mins too long, this movie misses the mark after 2 successful entries by Disney. The future looks bleak for Star Wars."
"289",0.5,"  This movie ruined my childhood memories by polluting it with a terrible 'I don't care attitude.' The SJW messages throughout the terrible plot and poor character development. I'm so disenchanted with the way the franchise is going."
"290",0.5,"  this movie was a disappointment to the star wars legacy."
"291",1,"  The film is a middle finger to the audience. When I was walking out the cinema I remember thinking did the director and writer even see the previous film or any other star wars film. All through the film it was constantly preaching political messages getting in the way of the story, although the George Lucas films did have this at times, but it was very subtle. It basically treats the audience like they are idiots. So many poor characters written badly to be honest I feel sorry for the actors in the film because I feel they were made to look like fools. Once again they ripped off the original trilogy episodes 5 and 6, so extra marks for originality (sarcasm). I feel I could go on much longer put trying to keep this short so I will simply say this worst stars film EVER, yes, worse than Phantom Menace. In fact watching how poor this film is it makes me appreciate the episodes 1-6 even more and I will not be going to see episode 9 unless drastic change in 'Disney Star Wars'."
"292",1.5,"  Putting all the political nonsense in the movie aside, it just wasn't a good story. There were some outstanding backdrops and sets in this movie, that is the only reason I even gave it 1.5 stars. The Tomatometer gives this movie a 91%. My only guess is those reviews are coming from people trying to keep their jobs. I still am looking forward to more Star Wars content, but only from creators like Dave Feloni."
"293",1,"  Not star wars. This is crap"
"294",0.5,"  Muy mala pelicula, no tiene secuencia, no tiene continuidad a la saga original, mala copias de los episodios 5 y 6, mal desenlace de Luke, aburrida en su mayor parte"
"295",0.5,"  I'm so sad. Don't Get Me Wrong, I'm a fan of Star Wars. But this is... not Star WARS. The people who made this movie obviously have a grudge against Star Wars at large, and what was set in the (not-that-good) Force Awaken. We want Star Wars, not Director's Visions WARS."
"296",0.5,"  This movie doesn't follow the other movies. I couldn't believe that they took everything that they setup from the last movie and just threw it out the window. This movie did not leave me wanting more. Disney you jumped the shark with this one."
"297",0.5,"  Horrible Movie. Even The Prequels were way better than this. Anakin's "" I don't like sand "" was way better than Luke's murder attempt. This movie destroyed the Luke Skywalker character. I wish this movie never existed."
"298",0.5,"  GUUUUUUUUUUUURLLLLL POWERRRRRRRRRRRR"
"299",1.5,"  Worst movie i have ever seen."
"300",0.5,"  I was thoroughly looking forward to The Last Jedi, but was severely disappointed with the direction of the film.1) There was so much build up for Snoke, but he turned out to be so easily beaten and there was no explanation about his origins.2) Holdo was a poor excuse for a leader - she could have easily explained to Poe why she made the decisions she did instead of creating mistrust amongst her crew.3) Rose Tico was a poor character - no real character development.4) Luke Skywalker was painted out to be such a weak character, even going so far as to wanting to kill his own nephew in his sleep. This doesn't sound like the Luke Skywalker we knew from the previous 3 movies.5) Leia had the ability to execute an unexplained force power without any training at all.6) The casino planet seemed completely unrelated and did not fit into the flow of the movie.7) Rey stsated that she already knew where she was from, and yet, was being called by Luke's lightsaber and the Jedi tree, which didn't really explain anything.I would strongly recommend against seeing this movie."
"301",0.5,"  The movie sucked....period"
"302",1,"  This movie has a terrible plot and childish characters. The SWU has lost a huge opportunity to expand its universe and damaged itself so hard that I am in doubt about the future of this franchise, unless this movie is rebooted. Besides the cosmopolitan environment. I didn`t care if the characters were a strong woman or not, or its ethnicity. The characters are just bad as does the plot. I`ve left the theaters completely sad and won`t be watching anything on it until I see severe changes on this franchise."
"303",0.5,"  Bad Decisions, Worst Movie Ever of SW"
"304",1.5,"  The bottom line is I did not like the movie at all. Yes, I saw the original trilogy as a kid and yes I had high expectations for the movie to be good. First, I felt the plot was not that great. All that build up for Luke to get his light saber back and then he threw it told me this was not going to be good. The bad jokes, the slow space chase of the Resistance from the First Order, the uselessness of all the new characters, the Disney toy plug with the meaninglessness of the Casino planet adventure, Leia blasted into space, making Finn and Poe look stupid versus every female character, cowardly Luke, leaving Snoke an empty character and poor man's Hoth battle with just a handful of the Resistance left made for a long disappointing story. I don't know if JJ Abrams can fix thus with Episode 9 but I have no interest in Rian Johnson's trilogy because I think he did a poor job of trying to open up the Star Wars saga to a new audience by insulting the loyal fans that go back to the 1970's with a poorly written and directed movie that went against George Lucas vision. I have no ill will. I just don't have any interest in Rian Johnson's vision."
"305",1,"  This review contains plot spoilers. The Last Jedi is a terrible movie. It features a disjointed and illogical plot, and destroys the central character of the entire saga. The film opens with the First Order engaged in a space battle with The Resistance. The heroes are stymied because somehow the bad guys can track their hyper space jumps, and therefore appear within moments after the good guys have thought that they made it to a safe location. Down to just enough fuel for one last jump the heroes lead a slow speed chase through space with the First Order in pursuit. Yet why does the First Order pursue them? They could simply jump through hyperspace to locations in front, to the sides, below and above them. They would be hemmed in, and quickly destroyed. This type of illogical storytelling is the very essence of The Last Jedi: the movie tells the audience something half baked, and expects them to go along blindly. Finn is once again portrayed as a selfish coward who will cut and run at the first sign of danger. He is caught in the act of escaping by Rose who threatens to have him imprisoned for desertion. Is that something that the resistance does? I was under the impression that the rebels in Star Wars were there because they wanted to be there. No one threatened to imprison Han Solo when he collected his reward, and left the rebellion in the lurch in A New Hope. Seems like a First Order thing, but who cares? Logic is optional.  Finally at the end of the movie Finn sees that there are causes worth dying for as the First Order takes aim at the last refuge of the heroes with a mini Death Star weapon that will rip their fortress open, and be the end of all organized rebellion to the evil in the galaxy. He aims his ship at this weapon preparing to sacrifice himself to save the future. And then Rose rams him out of the way in an incredibly selfish act that she claims is to save those she loves. What about all of the people in the fortress that are now doomed? And where will she and Finn escape to now that she has destroyed both of their vehicles, and allowed the First Order to destroy their only safe haven? Not great at the long term thought, Rose. Again pesky logic makes this movie difficult to enjoy The treatment of Luke Skywalker is an abomination, and insult to every true Star Wars fan. Luke admits that he crept into Ben Solo's room to read his mind as he slept in order to ascertain if he was turning to the dark side. This nocturnal espionage yields compelling evidence that the young man is indeed headed down the dark path. At this point Luke momentarily decides that the best course of action is to murder his nephew in cold blood. He quickly thinks better of this course, but not before the younger Solo wakes to see Uncle Luke standing over him with a light saber in his hand, and a murderous glint in his eye. This causes the youngster to attack Luke and kill his loyal Jedi apprentices. In The Return of the Jedi a much younger Luke surrenders to Darth Vader, because he believes that, in spite of all of the atrocities his father has committed, there is still good in him. At one point in his confrontation with Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine Luke loses control and viciously attacks his father, because Darth Vader discovers the existence of Leia by reading Luke's mind. After Luke cuts off his father's mechanical hand he comes back to himself, and throws his light saber aside. This nonresistant tactic ends up causing Vader to truly have a change of heart. Now we are supposed to believe that Luke Skywalker is a cold blooded murder. He doesn't attempt to talk to Ben. He just thinks of killing him. Luke would never do that. Not even momentarily. That is not Luke Skywalker. And this movie is not Star Wars. It's an ill conceived cash grab that assumes that Star Wars fans are morons that spout billions of dollars for zippy laser shows. It's calculated and manipulative trash."
"306",2.5,"  Personal i don't think its amazing nor is it terrible. One of the largest draw backs is it supporting cast, especially the new additions to the movie. Another problem is the creative tone changed due to the change of direct, this is very apparent in the first scene which continues on from the end of the previous movie. over all still a better film than 'The Force Awakens'."
"307",1,"  What a piece of crap. Saw it a few times, it keeps getting worse. Should have hired silent Bob. Watch his reweiw on youtube. Kathleen Kennedy i hate you. I can't believe how bad this movie is and what they did to the legend of Luke Skywalker. I think Disney should fire these idiots and say just kidding and start over"
"308",0.5,"  Just call it what it is, a Guardians of the Galaxy ripoff.."
"309",1.5,"  Probably one if the least faithful to the series movies. This does not necessarily mean it's bad, however I dont believe that something needs to be changed wl unless you're going to do it better than the originals.I felt the movie never struck the right balance between silly in a childish way, action and excitement. The pacing was frankly kind of weird (see the addition of fuel into the saga so they could have a very slow chase), during which Poe and Rose go to a casino planet so they can deepen their relationship from non-existant to two dimensional while tacking in some pretty hollow moral values.The Luke character come out of retirement to drink some bird milk (seriously) and anguish over some pretty weak moral dilemmas. I wish i could give it credit for a fresh and invigorating take on the existing series but the storyline was weak, the plot devices contrived and the acting was frankly not as good as 7, which I'll put back into the poor dialogue and almost slap stick level of childish comedy.Overall a very poor movie."
"310",0.5,"  Would give zero stars if I could. Worst star wars movie by far. Rose < Jar Jar."
"311",0.5,"  Avoided spoilers and Theories as much as possible coming in to this movie. No reviews, nothing to shape my expectations except 1 trailer. I was stunned on how bad the writing was and at certain points I just stared at the screen in disbelief. Only reason I watched the whole movie was because I hope it would do a Rogue One and get awesome in the end but sadly it just wrecked the ENTIRE STAR WARS UNIVERSE EVEN MORE!! Only reason people can delude themselves in to this being a good movie is because of the huge budget this movie had. If you just downgrade the music and visuals a tiny notch people would start hating this movie instead of get blinded by it."
"312",0.5,"  Terrible, what a waste of a great franchise"
"313",0.5,"  Terrible writing, terrible character development, terrible in every area.... But oh it looks pretty and Ray is female so it's amazing."
"314",1,"  With questionable story decisions that seem to reboot and/or just wipe clean all 7 previous episodes for the sake of subverting expectations but without delivering anything satisfying instead, there was very little for me to enjoy here. With plot threads setup by Force Awakens (2015) cut short and with no explanations to how the universe is in its current state after the of Civil War. The story leads nowhere, starting with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys, and ending with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys. It fails to treat the original cast of the OT respectfuly, and fails to provide the characters setup by Abrams 2 years prior with any meaningful development. Duplicating scenes from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" almost frame by frame, it feels short out of ideas. A lot of the characters come across a very incompetent, and many are misused or almost ignored entirely. The movie's tone is all over the place, with some scenes struggling to make sure if they wanna make you feel sad and anxious for the heroes, or laughing as if this was a light hearted comedy. More power to those who love the movie. to me, it wasn't an enjoyable film, even with very low expectations."
"315",5,"  Um dos melhores da saga, quebra todas as expectativas e apresenta situaÁ√µes totalmente fora das esperadas, foi de fato uma surpresa."
"316",5,"  Can't quite fathom why so many people have had such a negative reaction to this wonderful movie!? I've been a huge SW fan since the 80s. The Last Jedi was beautifully shot and directed - with an obvious love and respect for the Original Trilogy. The slapstick humor is sometimes a bit much, but seriously people - IT'S A MOVIE - it's ok to have a laugh. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is amazing."
"317",0.5,"  Where to begin with this movie. Others have already covered it's flaws, and what it's strengths were. Fundamentally this just wasn't well paced, the humor was misplaced and the movie is filled with glaring plot holes, where all reason is ignored as well as the rest of the franchise in order to ""Reboot Star Wars"" in the middle of a trilogy, creating a mess of a movie."
"318",0.5,"  I didn't believe it will be that bad, but it was. Bad, illogical plot, ridiculous space battle logic, stupid choices by main characters. Probably the worst Star Wars and a very bad SciFi movie."
"319",0.5,"  Heart breaking in ever single way."
"320",1.5,"  Kind of a turd. Was so bad it systematically made the Force Awakens worse, made the 3rd movie virtually limp in hype, and secured its own pkace next to the Phantom Menace in most disliked Star Wars movies. A mess of characters and storylines that meander, insult older fans, and ultimately amount to nothing in the grander Star Wars stort. A snarky dismantling of what you enjoy about Star Wars in the first place. Rian Johnson may be a capable director, but as a writer, as a Star Wars curator, he's a smoking disaster. Keep him far far away from any further Star Wars decisions. This movie was prequel atmosphere 2.0."
"321",1,"  Terrible movie, where do I begin. Luke Skywalker story arc is just laughable, this is the guy who wouldn't give up on his father and refused to believe he was all bad and wanted to turn him from the dark side, yet when when faced with the same dilemma with Kylo Ren (his nephew) he decides instead to hide away in an island to milk some alien cows?. The humour is misplaced and isn't funny, that opening scene with Poe Dameron in his X-wing joking with the commander of the imperial fleet is very much cringeworthy and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Also PLEASE someone explain just why Kylo Ren is so dark-side obsessed? Anakin at least had a reason and was an awesome villain. Kylo just seems like a 13-year-old who got his black eyeliner taken away. What a lack of respect for the Star Wars universe. Leia flying in space was so bad. And BB8 driving was stupid. Snoke was the only good character but then he was killed. It was two and a half hours of pure Bantha poodoo and I'm being polite. Star Wars is dead."
"322",2.5,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a very disappointing film. It feels poorly written and badly paced. It also feels like a film made by someone who knows little about the Star Wars franchise, and enjoys even less about it."
"323",0.5,"  If you watch this just on the surface it might not be that great but if you look deeper pay attention to all the little nods and winks and pick up on all the mind games this movie is great."
"324",1,"  Trash, Basura, Garbaje."
"325",0.5,"  Truly horrible movie. I am not a fanboy but like the Star Wars movies. This movie is not made well. Story, pacing, writing is all truly bad. The sets and effects don't even look that good. I don't understand what happened."
"326",0.5,"  Rian Johnson ruined the franchise enough said!"
"327",1,"  Definitely not for any true star wars fan, while it has interesting ideas, the failure in execution by Johnson dooms the movie. An entire sub-plot that seems forced and out if place, slows an already long movie. The time lines is off, and so many plot holes you'll break and ankle trying to avoid them. And of you were ever a fan of Luke Skywalker and his legacy, then this is a movie you should avoid."
"328",1,"  It is pretty bad as expected. Disney is to blame for it. Their agenda is obvious and it is something people and movie fans across the world have to fight against or very soon we will be forced to watch gay ballet dancers 24/7"
"329",1.5,"  good visuals, bad story, a lot of miss opportunities. Jokes on scenes that should be serious and a really bad secondary plot that drags the movie to a halt. As a movie by its own stands as a pretty movie but as a sequel fails horrible."
"330",0.5,"  I've always been a huge star wars fan but I HATED this movie!"
"331",0.5,"  I am a star wars fan. Growing up on the farm, we had two movies that i remember; Empire and Aliens. On sundays we would watch STO on the one local channel we could catch. This is my oldest love. I really want to love this film, i would love nothing more. I have watched it four times now, more painful each time, maybe just a little more numb to it. Johnson has made a beautiful film, no question. With gaping porn hole plot holes, near non existent character development and stunted undeveloped dialogue. Johnson made a pretty film, but it isn't a star wars film. This pile of steamy wonderment exists to needlessly kill off and demonize proven heroes and villians, derail a story that had some real prospects for the sake of a political agenda. This is the first time for me where watching a sequel has actually made me question the validity of the previous film. To a point where i loved Force awakens and now, upon realizing anything and anyone in the first film i cared about doesn't matter, I've never had a sequel make me end up hating both films, when i felt the opposite for the first. I didn't even know that was possible. Not a star wars film."
"332",0.5,"  the resurrection of Star Wars comes to a screeching halt. It resembled Space Balls more than anything else. The dated humor and lack of any depth left me with a strong sense of disgust. The addition on Rose dilutes the film even more. Her stale sarcasm screams of utter childish indulgence. Moreover, it begs the question..... why did they need to introduce a new character? Actually why even ask questions. This movie should have just never happened."
"333",2,"  A horrible attempt at making a Star Wars film as a whole. The director actually made it seem like he hated everything Star Wars was about before on a personal level and purposely sought out to make a movie that insulted all of the previous installments of the franchise. Save your money on this one. It's not even worth Redbox honestly."
"334",0.5,"  This is BY FAR the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It DISHONORS the saga's rich legacy while adding absurd characters and story lines. This never felt like a Star Wars movie and was just a giant troll on the fan base. Yeah, it looked beautiful but the novice writing and horrendous attempts at humor just completely ruined this film. I will no longer be spending my money on any Star Wars movies Disney produces. Period. They don't and never respected the source material and it shows, so why would I support their abominations of my beloved saga. Done and done."
"335",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie by a very wide margin. It is quite possibly the poorest written film to hit theaters in the past decade. But what makes this movie an absolute disgrace, is Rian Johnson's assassination attempt on the character of Luke Skywalker."
"336",0.5,"  This movie should of been called Star Wars gets ruined by an idiot director."
"337",0.5,"  Terrible film. Zero story telling or world building, and instead is littered with social justice warrior political messaging. Men are completely emasculated during the entire film, way too much forced humor, and Rose is worse than Jar Jar. And the treatment pf Luke's character is downright criminal. Flatliners was a better film than this. 0/10"
"338",2,"  This movie is, and i say this with all sincerity, an absolute slap in the face to long time Star Wars fans. Horrible writing, horrible plot, bland characters, and the complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker. It feels like a blatant and purposeful execution of all things from the original Lucas made films. It seems incredibly mean spirited and deliberate. Don't waste your time on this one."
"339",1,"  So many missed opportunities to make a good movie. Carrie Poppins, slow space chase, the entire Canto Bight scene and the overall lack of character development really left me frustrated. Most importantly is the terrible development of Luke Skywalker. So frustrating."
"340",0.5,"  What can be said about this atrocity of a movie that has not already been stated? For me, the saga ends with The Force Awakens. I'm going to pretend that the last jedi & all future Star Wars movies do not exist. JJA, RJ & KK can go whatever direction they want with this property, but I won't be along for the ride. I choose to keep my childhood heroes in their previous, ulaltered state."
"341",1,"  The last Jedi was a poorly written mess. It reminded me of the walking dead in that all the drama and tension is achieved because characters don't talk to each other and it seems like they actively avoid simple conversations that would completely fix or end the movie. The story literally does not move forward at all from the end of the force awakens. I really wanted to love this movie, but someone could skip this movie and only need a short star wars opening crawl to catch up: Luke dies because he used the force to hard, Snoke was killed by Kylo because reason, and the rebels and first order are exactly where they were at the end of force awakens except now the first order is run by Kylo who I'm not even sure is a bad guy anymore or what his motivation even is. Oh and Rey is a nobody but can do whatever the plot needs her to do because plot armor."
"342",1,"  The Last Jedi was one of the worst Star Wars movies I've seen in a long time not since Episode 1 has one been this lame. . It left people feeling like the whole order of the original premise of the Jedi was highjacked along with the Star Wars saga, by people with leftists political agendas currently happening in these United States. Removing the role of men and manhood and replacing it with a more feminine and transgender influence. What a joke. Star wars and movies in general were at once a place for escape for movie goers from the real word so to speak. Luke Skywalker's character was the most disappointing for a Star wars fan. I may never again go to see Star Wars even if there is another made. I choose now to remain forever as thinking that Star Wars ended with the Return of the Jedi, as the last seen clearly shows. Thanks alot Disney you can kiss your true Star Wars fans goodbye. Word of advise. Don't bother making any more and go back to cartoons."
"343",0.5,"  This Is complete garbage, no script, no characters, no Star Wars just another shallow movie from scifi channel, Even worst, those movies are funny at least, and a movie, not this shit."
"344",2,"  OMG there is SO much wrong with this movie where to begin?"
"345",4,"  While it does have pacing issues and one noticeably unnecessary subplot, The Last Jedi is a strong, complex entry in the Star Wars franchise that successfully develops its layered characters, both new and old, without sacrificing its exhilarating action. All while bringing along a few surprising and effective twists."
"346",0.5,"  Long and boring, no substance what so ever. A few nice action scenes mixed in between the long pointless dialogue."
"347",1.5,"  While the Last Jedi was visually stunning, the plot was jumbled up and confusing. There were too many characters and story lines transitioning throughout. Holdo was useless, Admiral Akbar should have been the one in her place. Why are the male CHARACTERS PORTRAYED as helpless, diminished individuals? I couldn't help but feel as though the female leads were CONSTANTLY being shoved down my throat as the main 'Heroes', From Rey, to Rose, Rose's sister, Holdo and even Leia using the force randomly was terrible. I was DISAPPOINTED that the female characters were forced for political agenda. The only scene I enjoyed was the Praetorian Guards vs Rey and Kylo. Other than that I walked out of the THEATRE DISAPPOINTED, not because of debunked fan theories or because I feel ""threatened by women"" or because the main lead of the film is a female, but because it was a poorly written film which was too long with a storyline devoted to pointless casino scenes (which looked amazing, but the plot... not so much). The characters were dwindled down rather than progressing forward. Rey and Kylo have returned to square one plus Rose and Finn have a forced romance. In my opinion, Luke was out of character. You mean he would throw away a lightsaber of his fathers!? Which represents His Jedi lineage? Luke would never kill his nephew in his sleep! The same Luke who brought Vader, A man who committed mass genocide back to the light? With Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford out of this trilogy, It leaves me questioning how J.J is going to conclude it in one film."
"348",1,"  The first Star Wars movie I watched that I didn't like. Utter trash full of real world political agenda."
"349",0.5,"  The worst movie in the franchise , everybody has already said what's wrong with it."
"350",0.5,"  This Movie was God-aweful."
"351",1,"  I left the theater confused, trying to search my feelings about the movie I just watched. Now, four months later, I can say I feel disappointed. Lack of plot continuity from TFA, Luke becomes a loser not capable of defeating a force apprentice. The first order are a bunch of morons whom you can prank anytime via speaker. The supreme leader is another loser who can't feel the force and we are presented with super boring non interesting characters like Rose and Holdo. I did liked TFA. Way to ruin ruin the franchise Disney. not spending a single penny ever on anything Star Wars related."
"352",2,"  Yeah...I didn't even bother going to the theater to watch this one. I knew it was going to be ""high budget bad"" I just didn't realize how bad. The special effects, as always, are awesome. But the plot continues to rot, and the characters...I'll have no choice but to add a spoiler here. My Luke Skywalker was willing to die to save his dad. This generation's Luke? In a moment of weakens wants to freaking murder his nephew?"
"353",0.5,"  Star Wars for SJW's. Fuck you for ruining the legacy!"
"354",0.5,"  SNOKE HAD NO POINT AFTER HE WAS KILLED BY KYLO REN WHICH SUCKED BEING SOMEONE WHO WAS SO POWERFUL AND THEY KILLED LUKE SKYWALKER AND A VERY WACK WAY AND DOES ANYONE ELSE FILL LIKE IT SHOULD HAD BEEN GENERAL ACKABAR (IT'S A TRAP GUY) SHOULD HAD REPLACED HALDO WHEN SHE FLEW THE SHIP INTO THE OTHER SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED SAYING (YOUR TRAPPED RIGHT BEFORE IT CRASHED) OTHERWISE EVERYTHING WAS GOOD IT GET'S A C+ FROM ME!"
"355",0.5,"  It feels like Disney/Lucas Film are actively trying to destroy this franchise. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and after seeing this movie, I doubt I will ever see another Star Wars movie in the theater again. This is a terrible movie and an embarrassing end to heroic characters that we have got to know over the last 40 years."
"356",1,"  I can't even begin to write my disgust for this creation. Enough to make me drink heavily.. I saw it opening night. I waited until now hoping I would feel better about it... nope.. sigh one of the worst things I have ever been subjected to on a date. Have one star as I read half stars are not counted. Thinking of selling my Disney stock."
"357",1,"  Good way to trash the legacy of Leia, Luke and the Force"
"358",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars movie by far!"
"359",2,"  I used to like this movie but I'm starting not to really like this movie anymore. Worst out of the Star wars movies"
"360",2,"  This film is hot garbage juice. Pretty hot garbage juice, but garbage juice nonetheless. Nonsensical character arcs, pointless characters, pointless story-crushing ""twists"" and a truly short-sighted view to the franchise by the director/writers pushed purely to help push an agenda. 1 star for the visuals, 1 star for the truly fantastic performance from some of the actors in the face of their terrible script."
"361",1,"  Star Wars, The Last Jedi marks the first time in my life where I've walked out of a movie theater angry at the movie I just watched. It's a steaming pile of SJW garbage shoveled right in your face at nearly every turn."
"362",0.5,"  GARBAGE. i WONT BE SEEING THE NEXT ONE UNTIL THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PURGE OF THE 'CREATIVE TEAM' BEHIND THESE DEBACLES."
"363",0.5,"  Waste of the original Star Wars characters and haven't built the new characters and villains enough to be as appealing as the original movies. Just not a movie for Star Wars fans."
"364",0.5,"  I have always been a fan of Star Wars,but this the last Jedi is terrible!I have never been so bored watching a sw movie in my life. It's a very drug out unin"
"365",1,"  Seriously a 2 hour car chase to make no progress in the story of the trilogy."
"366",1,"  I disliked most everything about this movie. The story is poor to say the least and littered with plot holes. The First Order reigns supreme with no discussion why even despite just losing Starkiller Base. It's leadership is nothing more than blundering buffoons and frankly the Resistance is about the same. Luke Skywalker was reduced to a moron and was easily beaten by Rey in a stupid stick battle. Got to see Yoda! Overall shame for the franchise."
"367",2,"  As much as I liked some parts of this movie. I have to say this is the biggest piece of junk in the ST universe. With junk like this movie I cannot wait for George Lucas to write and produce a new generation of Sci-Fi movies. Perhaps on another Galaxy"
"368",1,"  Been a long time SW fan, love TFA and R1. Was so excited for this movie felt like Xmas going to the cinema to watch this. I remember leaving feeling empty, kind of in shock and tried to justify it, after the second viewing I genuinely hate this movie. It's not just this movie but the direction Lucasfilm is going with Kennedy at the top, we need a SW fan running things not someone who is going to push a political agenda on everyone. Kennedy is incompetent look at all the directors she has fired for example. I'm not giving Disney anymore money until they sort this mess at the top of Lucasfilm out and put someone in charge who cares about the franchise and all the fans. FYI I'm not a bot or Russian"
"369",0.5,"  WHAT A waste of mark Hamill. rey is a mary sue. the film makers completely misunderstand the appeal of the original films. it's crazy to me how high the film critic score is -what is going on there?"
"370",0.5,"  This movies sucked and the critics need to have their heads examined"
"371",0.5,"  Worst star wars movie ever.blank boring characters with no development. what a waste."
"372",1,"  Killed star-wars for me. Ruined Luke, made the First Order into buffoons. If I wanted Team Rocket level antics from major villains, I'd just go watch Saturday morning cartoons. Theres a myriad of issues with the film just beyond that, but I'm not willing to write a 2,000 word essay on why I hate this. Theres more articulate reviews left concerning the problems with the film. In a word, its a string of scenes written before the story, and then plot contrivances connecting them, with little concern to the overall universe and existing characters."
"373",0.5,"  Huge star wars fan. I'm 40 years old so I've been there from the beginning. The nonsensical, goof-off, slapstick humor completely ruined it for me. It felt a lot like the prequels because of that. The tone of Rogue One was good and it's one of my favorite in the series. They need to try to stick to that tone. I don't know where Lucasfilm every got the idea that fans want comedy in Star Wars. Is it because Han Solo was sarcastic in the original trilogy and fans loved it? When the OT started to derail with the Ewoks, there was fan blow-back. It's crazy to me that Lucasfilm cannot recognize the correlation between poorly acted slapstick moments in Star Wars and fan criticism. Ep 4, 5, 6, 7 and Rogue One have the right formula."
"374",0.5,"  absolutely shit movie! and i have followed star wars all my life! I have close to every toy! dvd! poster! you nme it ive got it! and the last jedi can kiss my arse! I hope that SOLO is a good movie and gets us back on track! loved force awakens... new characters are awesome .... not rose! rey..... meeh she ok"
"375",0.5,"  NOT A STAR WARS STORY AT ALL!!! ABSOLUTE TRASH"
"376",0.5,"  Worst SW movie until we have E9. Please give us a new hope!"
"377",2,"  Space battles make no sense. Luke Skywalker's character makes no sense. General Hux and Kylo Ren act like two children leading an army (also no sense how they got promoted to that point). Don't get me started on Rose and Canto Bight. Oh, and Rey is still a mary sue."
"378",0.5,"  Everything I want to say about this movie has been said a thousand fold. Why this generation hates the original films, I have no idea. Because they can't be topped? For me Rogue One was on par with ROTJ as the 3rd best in the saga. Very close indeed. You CAN make a sequel to a classic of old without destroying it's legacy & still be a good film. Watch rogue one or blade runner 2049 or creed. All were good, paid homage to the classic movie it was a part of & didn't destroy it's legacy & alienate fans.Besides the obvious franchise killing decisions of this movie, where were the droids? Aliens from the sw universe? Force awakens didn't have them either. Twi'leks? Rodians? Saw twi'leks in rogue one. This movie was a joke & good luck getting people to see episode 9"
"379",1.5,"  This motion picture had no plot or main character. Shameful."
"380",0.5,"  I loved the force awakens, I was really disappointed by this flick. There was so much more that could've been done with this movie I feel. Saw Too little of Snoke and Luke. We could have been given a little something of Snoke and Reys' backstory. It was teased and then never saw fruition. The whole trip to the casino planet seemed like a waste of time. We could've seen more of Luke or Rey doing something meaningful. What about Finns' backstory? We know nothing of him! Luke would have never have attacked a young Ben, and would have definitely left his planet. There was a lot missing from Leah's character as well. She obviously had some kind of training, but there was no mention of this at all. Rose was Underdeveloped and unneeded. What About Laura Derns' Character? Didn't like her character either. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they were women! Captain Phasma was awesome, but again, no character development and overwhelmingly unused. I see a trend of pushing Feminism and Staying away from the tried and true Star Wars formula"
"381",1,"  It is not the worst movie ever made, but it is close. It is full of just jaw dropping moments of stupidity. Should be retitled as ""Spaceballs 2"" only not as funny."
"382",1,"  Easily the worst Star Wars movie. Terrible story and characters. A slap in the face to the fans and original characters."
"383",1,"  I'm giving it one star for the special effects. Not even the music can save this piece of garbage. We've heard it 8 times already. Complete disrespect to fans of the franchise and one of the worst attempts at ""filmmaking"" in history. Never have we seen someone try not only to destroy plot points from the previous movie in a trilogy but also do his best to make it as hard as possible for the next movie to follow up. An objectively bad movie both from the standpoint of fan service and entertainment. China appropriately phrased it as ""insulting to their intelligence"". Disney should focus on quality management instead of calling those who dislike the movie ""sexists""."
"384",1.5,"  This movie is not Star Wars anymore. 1 of my favorite things about star wars was there was ""NEVER"" any swear words. This movie either ruined star wars or its NOT STAR WARS ANYMORE upon breaking tradition. Now I'm not saying this movie isn't good, cause it is a Great movie, but just to me ""NOT STAR WARS"""
"385",0.5,"  This is, in short, just bad movie making."
"386",0.5,"  Visually stunning and well filmed. This is the only good thing i can say. The characters are poorly written and the science is terrible. Where does the trilogy go from here?"
"387",0.5,"  Lifelong Star Wars fan, so disappointed in the direction of this movie. Luke was not Luke, Rey is a Mary Sue, Finn and Rose are worthless and pointless to the plot, little to no character progression, so sad."
"388",1,"  He ignored everything that came before. They just need to let this die"
"389",1,"  Just awful, blatant SJW agenda injected into a family fun decades old saga that disrespects said decades old saga fundamental storytelling."
"390",2,"  I was not pleased with this film. It seemed to me that they were trying to cater to a different democratic. Truly sad what they have done t such a good story."
"391",0.5,"  What a mess of a movie. Plot holes galore, poor characterization, a completely pointless casino planet side plot, and worst of all the treatment of Luke Skywalker. This will be the first Star Wars film I don't buy on blu ray. It goes against the grain for me to be so negative about my beloved Star Wars but this movie is bloody awful."
"392",2,"  Enjoyed the saber battle, Adam Drivers and Mark Hamill's acting skills but that was all. Very let down with the storytelling and the terrible characters. The force has become way too female and the story a mess."
"393",1,"  A Star Wars movie made by someone who is deeply ambivalent about Star Wars. The result is confused and narratively inept."
"394",0.5,"  As a die hard star wars fan, I was very excited to see this movie. After watching the force awakens and waiting with anticipation for this one. Hoping to see my childhood hero Luke Skywalker again. I am beyond disappointed. The story was terrible the character development was all wrong. I am sorry but this does not feel like a star wars movie. Sad what Disney have done to it."
"395",0.5,"  Literally THE WORST Star Wars Movie I've EVER WATCHED. NOT due to lack of action, special effects or stupid Jar Jars... it FAILED miserable as it completely RUINED ALL of Star Wars mythology, Jedi force, the conflict of Sith and Jedi and made Luke Skywalker, my childhood hero a weak, old, useless past his time Jedi, NOTHING like how Obi One was portrayed! Similarly, while Luke had to get extensive Jedi training to be good at anything, and so was Anakin, Rey simply beat Kylo and Luke and others by just random forces! It's beyond pathetic! The whole going to the island was a waste of time, no training, no Jedi teachings, nothing! Stokes kill was pathetic, the whole Kylo Ren being a spoiled kid was weak, the SJW socialists non-sense was too much, Princess Leah somehow FLYING in the space back from explosion was stupid, dropping BOMB in the middle of space with no gravity, and WEAK unlikable characters were horrible and would NEVER generate any interest in the long run like the old movies did when I was a child. Also, the last scene was an EPIC FAILURE, it was a complete insult to all of Luke fans that he did NOT participate in an actual light sabre fight, and it was his ghost. It was literally icing on the cake! I watched Star Wars as a child and have followed it ever since like nothing else in my life and Disney, Hollywood Elite and SJW culture RUINED IT FOR ME... FOREVER. I will skip the last movie as there's literally no character worth watching is left on the franchise. I personally don't mind Rey, but they have butchered her character and her story is weak beyond belief! So, overall SKIP this one, or watch it when it comes to TV or Netflix, not worth the $20 at the movies... specially if you are a long-term fan of the original trilogy."
"396",0.5,"  Worst star wars ever, didn't go anywhere should have been a stand alone without any main people we know and love. How Iran Johnson and Disney can't understand how bad this movies is"
"397",1,"  Even worst than episodes 1,2 and 3."
"398",1,"  This is an honest opinion of The Last Jedi, it had great effects and some amazing fight scenes, but that is the only positive I have. Luke was a terrible character, not at all who he should have been. Rey is the biggest Mary Sue in the world, Kylo is whiny and a prick, we all know Kanto bite sucked ads Fin was useless Rose is an awful character. Walked away feeling super underwhelmed and upon a second viewing realize how much this movie sucks for me."
"399",5,"  This is one of the best Star Wars films ever made. It breaks the mold while staying true to George Lucas's world. Rian johnson is an outstanding filmmaker and writer. Adam Driver, Mark Hamil, Carrie Fischer, and Daisy Ridley are amazing. Everything about this film takes Star Wars to a new level and sets up a stage fire Star Wars to continue for generations to come. Don't listen to the 19 salty fanboys who are just angry we didn't get a repeat of the original saga and so they spend hours a day down voting the reviews of this film. Watch it."
"400",0.5,"  So sad. I viewed this movie twice in the theater. Visually, it was beautiful, and had some fun sequences, but as a Star Wars film, it was so weak. J.J. set things up fairly well with The Force Awakens, only for Johnson to throw it all away to castrate the male characters, particularly Skywalker, while at the same time pushing these ""flawless"" female characters up to the fore to be politically correct. Rey is the same clueless girl we got in the Force Awakens with little development to her character. Finn had more development, willing to sacrifice himself for a cause he believes in, only to have some mechanic whose only purpose is to spout off some political message jump in and stop him. Poe is shown to be a complete over the top hot head here, which isn't a bad idea in and of itself, but the entire idea of withholding the escape plan was just unnecessary. Kylo still isn't an intimidating villain, and Snoke's death had no real weight to it. And finally, Luke Skywalker's character was just...disappointing. Mark Hamill delivered a good performance for what he had to work with, but considering murdering his own nephew after he had redeemed his father who had done countless terrible acts years before was just a joke. Lucasfilm needs to be brought under better management. They need a president who actually understands the franchise that is being worked on, rather than gearing everything toward targeting a demographic that was never really intended to be the sole focus of the series. There were always strong female characters in the series and in the other related media. Unless Lucasfilm changes management and gets a grip on things, you'd be better off enjoying the Lucas era Star Wars, and some of the books and comics from that period."
"401",1,"  While technically a visually impressive film, the plot requires you to turn your brain off and every single character who isn't Kylo Ren suffers from poor character development. It fails as entertainment and to be frank, I never want to see it again."
"402",1.5,"  I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan and I was bored by this movie. Sure, it didn't meet my expectations but that's not why I didn't like it. From Rey hardly being trained by Luke, to the boring Canto Bight sequence, I feel like I wasted a vacation day and money on this film."
"403",1,"  its a parody with nice visuals."
"404",0.5,"  This is the worst installment of Star Wars series. Poor script and blunt disrespect to characters and established universe is so contemptuous and insulting, that it truly hurts to see."
"405",0.5,"  This movie was a complete abomination. It totally pissed on everything that came before it - no respect whatsoever for the Star Wars universe. Just bad and nearly every level! The beginning of the end of Star Wars."
"406",5,"  It was a good movie. My wife and I enjoyed very much."
"407",5,"  Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. Every prequel was the worst thing that ever happened and ruined their childhoods, Rogue One was too grim, The Force Awakens was too similar to the originals, Last Jedi was too different from the originals, a lot of people hate Return of the Jedi for having Ewoks and a second Death Star. Some of the internet hate this time around is stemming from the alt-right types that are mad that it stars a woman and a black man, but aside from that it's business as usual.If you'd like to see a Star Wars movie that adds to the mythos, defies expectations, surprises you as strongly as Empire Strikes Back did, gives Luke Skywalker a full story arc and upsets all the right people, this is the movie you've been waiting for."
"408",1,"  Worst Star Wars movie ever. I have absolutely no interest in seeing he next one now."
"409",0.5,"  I would rather watch paint dry on a wall for 152 minutes then subject my brain to this mindless tosh again."
"410",1,"  I did not like this movie at all. It's boring an confusing . The Tone is all over the place. The characters are no longer likable. A good thing is that it's very pretty."
"411",0.5,"  i am huge star wars fan since 1977 and this is a very bad star wars movie it ignored the force awakens plots that needed filled the plots in the last jedi made no sence."
"412",0.5,"  There is so many things wrong with this movie they cannot be listed. Check out MauLer the youtube channel for an honest review of this dumpster fire. The worst part about this film, besides dismantling what it meant to be STAR WARS, is that people think there's bots and online trolls manipulating the rating. The movie is objectively terrible and has some of the worst characters ever invented, its honestly amazing how this film was shot and released."
"413",1.5,"  It was a good movie to just kill time my main issues is that the movie felt a lot like a marvel movie to me. another issue is that i did not understand how she got so far with no training but that will diffrent till i read why she is it was the laziest writing i have seen in a movie and kill the main villain and now there is no threat to the galaxy and then now that rey and kylo are the only ones left kind kills the story. just didn't feel like a star wars movie just feel disappointed in Disney and what they did to the series"
"414",5,"  Full of action, adventure, great special effects and heart. This is one of the best additions to the Star Wars saga. The low ratings in the audience score category feel false based on everyone I know that saw it. Beware digital manipulation of the audience score."
"415",0.5,"  Visually it is a pretty picture, though its horrible writing, plot that is missing in action, and its overall dismissal of all things Star Wars legendary, made this the first Star Wars movie I have only seen once, and it was hard to suffer through that opening night viewing. Clearly, Disney wants to take Star Wars in a different direction ... if you didn't watch or care for Star Wars before, you might like this film as it is completely different from the Star Wars of past. Though if you enjoyed and respected Star Wars of the past, this is a terrible experience and painful waste of time."
"416",1.5,"  This is a big dumb movie that begs you not to think too much about the forced plot and just enjoy the spectacle.There's brief glimpses of brilliance, but it's bogged down in a sea of mediocrity. Whenever there's a serious moment, it's undercut with something goofy. The entire film feels like a big joke. They really dropped the ball with Luke's new character. If you are a fan of the original trilogy, you might be shaking your head by the end due to some of the decisions made.The film does look pretty. Will probably look great in 4k."
"417",1,"  bEAUTIFUL VISUAL WHICH COULDN'T SAVE THIS MOVIE IF THE PRODUCER'S LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. BAD STORY, POINTLESS CHARACTERS, SENSELESS PLANS AND ILLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS SHOWING WHOEVER SIGNED OFF ON THIS STORY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW STAR WARS."
"418",0.5,"  no character development, unanswered plot holes that they created in the last movie, mistreatment of the Iconic characters and the past movies themselves. To many political agendas and I could go for hours. Casino scene/ Kanto Bite scene is just an insult."
"419",0.5,"  I'm still crying at how bad it was."
"420",0.5,"  Sencillamente se han cargado la saga,es un episodio que jamas debio existir,el director deberia ser encarcelado.Una falta de respeto a decadas de sueÒos y a un universo construido durante 40 a√±os y destruido en 150 minutos."
"421",0.5,"  This is the worst Star Wars movie by far. It's well directec but the story is complete garbage. The current backlash is only the tip of the iceberg."
"422",0.5,"  I had to stop watching this movie 3 times. I'm a lifelong star wars fan and was looking forward to sharing the franchise with my kids.... congratulations you have destroyed it. I just don't understand how Hollywood has to push this political agenda on everyone. Well, you reap what you sow, I will not be seeing an future movies, buying any merc. and I will not be taking my kids to Disney or sharing buying any movies post 2003. Way to go destroying your core demographic... and for what? Hangout with your richie friends in hollywood? Here is an idea, some production company should start making real movies,with real plots and characters that make sense. That represent everyone, not just identity politics demographics."
"423",0.5,"  No continuity with TFA... pretty much every set up fell flat on its face. Then if you judge it as a stand alone film it gets worse.

"427",0.5,"  horrible movie, do not see it if you enjoy Star Warsits not that this is a bad ""Star Wars"" movie, its just bad in general. The jokes are unbearable and often ruin the pace and tone of the movie. There is no real tone or real pace of the movie. Which diminishes and takes away from actual good parts of the movie and scenes that are intended to moving, serious, sad or have an impact of some sort. In Star Wars terms, they made every character Jar-jar at some point and thought it would be ok to have the Jar-Jar at a reveal scene."
"428",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars movie ever"
"429",1,"  If you enjoy this movie, that is ok. If you do not, that is ok.If you do not agree with me, that is ok. All I am saying is that there are things in this movie that I do like. Here is a short list.1) Rey, although she may be a bit overpowered, I can look past that. Suspension of disbelief and all. She is a great character although the ""mirror of erised"" in the chamber of secrets scene tested that with me.2) Yoda schooling Luke. Even Masters have something to learn.3) Poe and the opening scene proving how great of a pilot he is. Everything after that in the scene is utter garbage. Nice slow moving bombers that get wiped out.4) Got to see a character that looks like Luke Skywalker on the screen. Does not act like Luke in any way. Even though he has been disenchanted, after years of exile, he would have decided to do something about it.There are a few other things.That being said...Those are FAR outweighed by the amount of canon destroying garbage that have been blended into this work. It has Star Wars THINGS in it, but it is NOT a work that positively contributes to the SW universe.Utter garbage. Here is the short list.1) Canto Blight. THE WHOLE THING. Especially broom ""boy"", but I will come back to that.2) DJ. Dumbest character ever.3) Maz Kanata's shoehorned ""appearance"". A VERY strong character wasted.4) Wasted Finn. Is he still FS?5) Holdo. Despicable character.Leia ""taught her everything she knew""? Really? Leia is a strong character that CARES about people and acts like it. Holdo cares about her authority and protects it instead of sharing what is going on. Waited until almost the ENTIRE flotilla of escape shuttles was wiped out before doing the ""Holdo Maneuver"". Really? What is up that that name? NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF SW EVER THOUGHT TO RAM ANOTHER SHIP WITH YOUR SHIP JUMPING INTO LIGHTSPEED?5) Ending the film with Broom ""boy"" using the Force to sweep the floor and looking into the sky. That entire epilogue was unnecessary.Too many more issues to list."
"430",1,"  Overall, TLJ has a bad story and characters, if you are a casual Star Wars fan you might like it, if you know SW and the source material, prepare for an unnecessary change to what SW used to be! Worst SW movie as far as Story and Character development."
"431",0.5,"  The music in the film is phenomenal, and there a a few moments with speculator effects, primarily involving a space battle, other than this I have nothing positive to say about this film. The scenes are acted well for the most part but the scrip and plot are very week. The protagonist seems extremely powerful and important yet there seems to be no reason why. She meets one of the greatest characters in film history and he doesn't train her...she is already powerful and his actions make him unrecognizable to the hero we once new. This is the longest Star Wars movie AND has the least content, not much actually happened in this film yet...all the best characters a dead. By itself this is a bad film, being a Star Wars films, I would say it's the worse yet. I'd rather watch Battle for Endor."
"432",1,"  +: VFX, SFX, Acting -: Script (consistency, characters, events, ...)"
"433",0.5,"  As Kathleen Kennedy stated, ""I have a responsibility to the company that I work with. I don't feel that I have a responsibility to cater in some way. I would never just seize on saying, 'Well, this is a franchise that's appealed primarily to men for many, many years, and therefore I owe men something.'"" At best, this decision is poor marketing; ignoring the fan base that made Star Wars as popular and iconic as it is, and at best, it's a spiked-bat being used to bludgeon politically-correct ideology down the throats of a public, unwilling to spend upwards of $100/family for the privilege of being preached to for 2.5 hours. I gave them a chance after TFA, but they blew it big time... my family and I are done with Star Wars."
"434",0.5,"  Horrible what they did to Luke. Characters are all treated just terrible. Not happy at all with the current direction with this franchise."
"435",1,"  thank god I never have to watch that again"
"436",1.5,"  As much as I wanted to enjoy the film, there were too many plot points that were purposely made to be the opposite of everything that should have happened for the sake of doing the unexpected that the movie didn't make sense."
"437",2,"  It's not the worst Star Wars installment, but it is close. From the space-chase context that lasts less than 24 hours, to Luke's enological character arc and incongruence to TFA (why the heck was Lors on Jakku with the map? Why was R2 shutdown until the map was presented?), and his ultimate pointless suicide, to Rose's last minute crash, monologue, and cliched kiss, to the structurally unproductive Canto Bight tangent and the waste of characters like Admiral Akbar, Snoke, Luke, Leia, and DJ, to the introduction of new, flat characters (Hodo, DJ), the Last Jedi offers great examples of how not to write and execute a screenplay. It will be taught as such in MFA programs forevermore! It simply misses the mark in its storytelling and doesn't smoothly fit within the larger trilogy and cannon. All this movie had to accomplish was to create a chemistry between Luke and Rey (pass the torch), one that is mutually beneficial and coherent. It failed and all these other issues are exacerbated by that failure. You can like the movie, you can think its funny, or unique, you can like the characters too (I love the new characters), but you can't argue its good writing, by any rational measure. And that is why this movie fails."
"438",1,"  Movie is awful from opening with Luke throws light saber over shoulder and gross milking sea cow and his character being killed off too soon. No answers to any questions leaves you bored and not wanting to see next film. This movie has killed my excitement from expectations that Disney set up in TFA..Snoke getting killed in second movie not good"
"439",1,"  QUE PASO PORQUE TERMINO SIENDO UNA CAGADAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
"440",0.5,"  May the farce be with you...It's not the ""divisive"" choices taken with Luke's character. It's not the terrible sub-plots with Finn, Rose and Po. It's not the disregard or wasted potential of Snoke, Rey's parents, or Leia doing a Superman impression.It's the insultingly placed humour that undercuts the emotional impact of every. fucking. scene. I mean seriously. The opening with Hux and Po on loudspeaker is really funny... if it was the Lego adaptation?! Hux is a wasted character, seemed a bit off the hook Hitler style in 7, now he's just that really angry guy who provides comic relief. Oh wait, EVERY character in this film provides comic relief! Yay!... The jokes and gags weren't not funny, they were just so out of place and ultimately has ruined Star Wars. Wonderful. I love it when things become a parody of themselves.Yes, everything I listed in the first paragraph absolutely grinds my gears. I'm all for taking Star Wars in new directions, exploring more aspects of the force, new characters taking the story forward. But not when the aforementioned is executed in such a way that it pillages, burns and rapes the entire canon back catalogue.Can I believe Luke would act the way he does? No. However, if that's the way Rian Johnson wants to take the character, cool - but justify it to me. Make me actually believe Luke could take the path he did. Of course he could act out of character, but he was written in such a way that the only thing he had in common with Luke is that Mark Hamill played him...Here's my luke-warm response to Rians decisions:Fast foward to the end of TFA. The emotional weight and reward of finally seeing Luke, both Rey and Skywalker welling up as much as the John Williams score. Snap into TLJ, Rey gets the saber out again (wtf continuity rant for another time) and Luke just grimaces and throws it away like a comedy sketch? What the fuck?! The tone of this character is awful, there's just nothing in common with what we've seen previously. I must state again, I'm all for character development and seeing a new side, but this treatment was detrimental to not only everything that had come before, but to Luke as a standalone in the movie.I won't deliberate too long, can of worms and all... but the flashbacks of Luke and Kylo sleeping?Come on man, Luke could have felt Kylo's supposed conflicted feelings without physically waving over his head. The last time I checked, all Jedi (including Luke in early stages of force use) could sense presence and feelings from a distance. So now Luke is supposedly diminutive in his force sensing abilities compared to previous movies. Great. The whole entering Ben Solo's room at night then whipping out his big green is also fucked up. Luke is now a coward for going in Ben Solo's bedroom to attempt murder while he sleeps and his guard is down, then he's just a straight up pussy because he doesn't follow through (enter Kylo sith fit wake up routine).Rian could have done ANYTHING. But chose this? I cannot comprehend. Luke has seen a lot in the past, Dad Vader ring any bells? Guy who pretty much single handedly wiped out the Jedi. So if he sensed dark in Ben Solo, it would have been so much cooler if he faced up to him properly, fell out with Leia because he wanted to kill her son, Han stuck in the middle doing that shrugging thing like when the Ewoks come out of nowhere in ROTJ... there's some great family space opera shit right there! And because we have virtually no back story on the last 30 years, we're already robbed of emotional weight. Eurgh. I'm disgusted frankly.Swiftly moving on, now I've got the important shit out the way... Finn might as well have died in TFA. The one moment he had any purpose or gravitas, Rose (yawn) stops him from committing suicide. Great. What I wanna know is, how did Finn drag Rose all the way back from the first order front line into the abandoned Rebel base without getting shot down? Again, for another time...Rose is shocking. Po ""intless"" Dameron. Thanks.Leia Superman... so many things wrong with that, but bottom line she can't be in Episode 9. Now she's gonna have an expected but underwhelming death in that film. Great. But you killed Luke instead, even though Mark Hamill is still alive. Great.Anyway, I've gone off on one and missed out loads but hey! Nobody is reading this far anyway."

"449",2,"  I think that Star Wars fans should demand a remake of this film. Why not? If you order food at a restaurant and its not served the way you like you send it back to the kitchen. Well, this film is no different. To be fair, there were some good scenes that were interesting and enjoyable to watch. However, there were just too many mistakes made in this film. Many of the dramatic and emotional moments fell flat while other elements of the story were rushed and left unexplained. Its obvious that the writer/director didn't like Luke Skywalker. It showed throughout the depiction of the character. In addition, it feels as if the saga was hijacked in order to provide fans with a way out to make way for a new and different story line. Its not that new story development are a bad thing, but it was too much too fast. The film simply took too many liberties for a story as loved and cherished as Star Wars. So i'll repeat:, it was a nice try, but try again. I think the fans deserve a remake."

"459",5,"  A fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga! its gorgeous visual effects, shocking and unpredictable film that continues the Skywalker story beautifully. Mark Hamill is great and always will be as Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson brilliantly creates the magic with some risks that paid off. after watching the film I also realised older Star Wars fans may find it hard to accept what they see in this film. they even now say the most hateful things towards the film but its only cause they r very much attached to the original trilogy that they would have grown up with that again its hard for them to accept what it is now. but once again a great film."
"460",0.5,"  TFA had a duty to try to draw in new fans as well as please old ones, and it accomplished that duty fairly well. It setup some new characters for new fans to love and still did ok with the original characters. Harrison Ford would not have come back unless he was given a death scene, so he got his wish. Carrie was treated well and Mark was left out almost entirely but I wholeheartedly believe that JJ had planned on the next film (Ep 8) to be ""Luke's story"" and to make up for him having only 10 seconds of screen time in the first movie. He had setup some decent new characters that could have some amazing backstories explained later and character arcs. Rey was definitely a mary sue, but at least Finn was someone with a decent arc to his story. Poe was meant to be disposable but Isaac is just too likable. So we finally get to Episode 8 and we are dying after waiting 2 years to get payoff's to all the threads that JJ opened up with Snoke, the First Order, Rey-Finn-Poe and to see Luke get the story he deserved and we had waited decades to see. What do we get instead? We get a complete mess of a movie with plot holes that would be expected in a first-time director's indie film but not in the 8th film in one of the largest film franchises in cinema history. The movie starts out horrible with jokes that don't land, a huge plot hole dealing with how gravity works in space, and only gets way worse from there. Finn gets destroyed in this movie, despite being the only one of the 3 new characters with an interesting character arc. He's originally used just as another lame sight gag and joke that fails to land or be funny. Then he's almost treated like a coward, then he goes off on a side-plot with yet another new character, which was another huge mistake, and the movie then spend a painful amount of time dealing with their side-plot that makes no sense, isn't necessary, isn't wanted and wasn't even any good. According to the setup, the entirety of what's left of the Republic (which is odd since they were in complete power with peace in the galaxy for 30 years since the end of RotJ, yet just because the First Order destroyed 5 planets, the entire galaxy is now under heel of a much smaller military force than the Empire was? Yet, with what little the Republic/Rebellion has left running out of gas out in space, waiting to die, Finn and Rose have to spend time setting free a bunch of slave animals and would have failed entirely if not for BB-8 who is remarkably capable for a metal ball. Somehow, BB-8 became more baddass than Captain Phasma, which is another of the huge mistakes Rian makes in this joke of a movie that he somehow got away with. Every great character that JJ set up in the first installment of this trilogy was completely screwed over by Rian in TLJ. Poe looks like a cocky a-hole traitor, Finn is played for gags, gets tossed on a side quest, forced into a love interest after being denied the hero death that everyone else got to have. All the men are useless and all the women are making the decisions and doing all the ""right"" things. (along with BB-8) And I could spend hours on how this movie completely and fundamentally f's up Luke Skywalker. Decades in the making and Rian Johnson destroys him in just over 2 hours. Rian repeatedly, REPEATEDLY gave the middle finger to long-time fans of the series and the very people that have made it the huge money-maker that it is today. Luke, Leia, Admiral Akbar, etc were all completely screwed over, even the new characters were completely screwed, all the great new threads that JJ set up in TFA were just tossed away the same way Luke tosses Anakin's lightsaber over a cliff. How in the world this movie was ever greenlit and allowed to exist is beyond me. How the hell is managed to get 91% with critics just shows how corruptable that system obviously is. Even trying to stand on its own, this movie is horrible and full of plot holes, jokes that aren't funny and an entire side-plot that makes no sense and yet takes up nearly a third of the movie. And when placed into the context of being the middle movie of a new trilogy that also exists as part of a galaxy of films that already include two other trilogies, then this film is even weaker and falls even harder. I feel sorry for all the fans that Rian screwed over and shattered the hopes of with this laughable excuse for a film. I also feel sorry for Mark Hamill who was contractually obligated to film this crap and poor Carrie who we won't get to see again and have the ending she deserved. Kathleen Kenedy needs to be fired, Rian needs to keep his incompetent hands out of the Star Wars universe and poor JJ has a lot on his shoulders now to not only somehow fix all that Rian just f'd up, but somehow win back the fans that he flipped off in the process. The Force was NOT with this movie."
"461",0.5,"  The only objective should have been to tell a Star Wars story, not push a political agenda."
"462",1,"  Non existing plot, Uninteresting \ annoying characters in the worst star wArs movie to this daTe"
"463",0.5,"  This movie not only finished the trilogy but also managed to finish the franchise. 91% my arse. I can't say anything that hasn't been said before. It's just utterly baffling to me how they just threw so much away and thought it was a good idea.I'm not even that big a fan of the series so I can't even Imagine how the die hard fans must feel about this. Disney. you royally F@#%ed up."
"464",3.5,"  just leave the casino planet out of the final cut."
"465",1.5,"  What can I say to add to this conversation? Firstly I want to say that I didn't have any fan theories going into this film, so that argument against those who dislike the film is invalid in my case. I've watched it a few times now and have thought a lot about it. I am a fan of Star Wars, but not a fanboy (am a big time Trek fan), but I love the original trilogy and The Force Awakens, but this really was a disappointing movie. In an attempt to subvert the expectations of the audience the director manages to have no ""payoff"" from anything that was set up in The Force Awakens, or for things that were set up in THIS movie. You read that right. This movie doesn't even pay off itself. It also doesn't set anything up for the next movie. All we can look forward to are characters who are mostly the same as they were before this movie began, and a hope that Luke Skywalker makes an appearance as a force ghost to do something epic. I find the path and the story of the current characters very superficial and uninteresting. I do not feel the same way as I did at the end of The Force Awakens where I was excited and looking forward to the next movie. There are multiple plots going along at the same time and really only the Rey and Luke plot was interesting to me. Much of what happens seems like filler and has little consequence on the plot. There were also some heavy-handed political messages, which distracted from the film experience for me, mainly because they weren't done well. I think this movie also suffers with re-watchability. After seeing The Force Awakens, there were several scenes I looked forward to watching at home on my TV, but with The Last Jedi, I am struggling to think of a scene I want to see again. Maybe the Luke/R2 scene, Luke/Yoda, or maybe the throne room battle. I guess I could just look those scenes up on YouTube and save myself 2.5 hours. I'm not ranking this movie low because I'm an upset fanboy, it just wasn't a very good movie. Aside from any Star Wars related missteps, which there are several, a movie that barely rolls along with lack-luster characters and no payoff from the beginning to the end, it just isn't a good movie. I am giving it a star and a half for good visuals and a few scenes that were done well."
"466",0.5,"  What a colossal blunder--anachronisms, countless plot holes, character assassination, and prepubescent humor!"
"467",0.5,"  This Movie killed my interest in anything starwars to come. i will most likely not bother going to the theater for future starwars movies, ill just wait till its on TV or something."
"468",4,"  I can not believe that they only focus on the negative things, this movie has more positive things, it does not deserve all that hatred"

"473",0.5,"  I have finally seen this movie. I grew up with Star Wars and I think that whoever wrote the movie does not know Luke Skywalker. His character is not this person of the film. I feel as the franchise will continue to make money, they dont care about people who grew up with them. I prefer my daughter to watch the originals, at least they make sense. I hope people wi stop acting like it's a good movie, its not."
"474",1,"  The characters were just not very believable."
"475",2.5,"  same old Space Battle ..every friendly ships get destroyed and only ONE MAKE IT ..BORING STUFF ON ISLAND WITH lUKE ..THE ACTING from"
"476",5,"  It had some amazing twists. It was funny when it needed to be. It needed to be serious when it needed to be. It was something new and we got to see what can happen in the Star Wars Universe. And not to mention it was Carrie Fisher's last performance. Ever."
"477",1,"  A movie that goes nowhere fast and hard. This film disregards story line, character development, plot pace, series congruity and cinematography to aimlessly meander around a feminist plot line that it failed to clearly define."
"478",1.5,"  A mid-trilogie movie that left no material to make a concluding film..The movie has awesome jaw dropping CG effect, a strong cast a shit director and a distinct lack of focus."
"479",1.5,"  Lazy writing and in desperate need of a good edit. The force has left the building."
"480",3.5,"  eventually the mob mentality of hate this movie gets will die out and it will be seen as what it is. while it's not the best in the saga it is certainly a welcome addition that offers plenty of moments that are right up there with the best in the series. it's a welcome change of pace after The Force Awakens played it a little too safe and relied to heavily on the ""mystery box"" method that has failed jj abrahms on several occasions now. the movie has a few flaws that hold it back; but if you look at the overwhelmingly negative review, you'll find many inconsistency's on why people actually dislike it. i mainly decided to write this after seeing someone bash Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, claiming ""you'd think this was their first movie"", to claim their performances were poor while most of the movies biggest detractors find hamill and fishers performances to be the strong point of the movie. i feel its simply unfair for this movies fan rating to sit as low as it is with so many mindless, and idiotic reviews coming from people who would normally not bother adding a review to the movie if there wasn't this mob mentality of hate that this movie has recived. you would have to be a moron to say that this film somehow retroactively makes the prequels better, or somehow is as bad as the prequels, which is far from the case. you assholes make it so hard to enjoy anything and the fact that people refuse to acknowledge that this film has any positives at all and act like it was just a shit show from start to end is mind boggling."
"481",2,"  A disastrous movie which destroys everything that was great about the original franchise and 'The Force Awakens'. Instead it is replaced with senseless action, galaxy-wide plot holes and an unconvincing story."
"482",3,"  While different and usually subverts expectations, the movie seems indifferent to the lore of not the other trilogies but the film right before it. The cast is well done and the dynamic between Rey & Kylo is great, it is not enough to overcome the faulty logic in narrative and tone shifts in a majority of scenes. Good but not great for star wars"
"483",0.5,"  Horrifyingly bad film that destroyed much of the history and lore of star wars. A movie made for the population of idiocracy."
"484",0.5,"  Awful. The film's plot was incredibly poorly written. Too many plot holes, ridiculous pacing, unnecessary plot lines."
"485",2,"  A 152 minute SNL skit about Star Wars. Poorly directed, poorly written and unbelievably poorly acted. For example, felt like I was watching Mark Hamill goof it up, instead of Luke Skywalker. Some good ideas are ruined by bad jokes, bad execution and tonal inconsistencies."
"486",0.5,"  This movie is trash from beginning to end. The writer\director goes out of his way to spit on the original characters while undoing the consistency of the universe.Episode viii is an insult to the Skywalker legacy and an insult to all fans.I really wish this movie was never made"
"487",0.5,"  I DO NOT LIKE THE DIRECTION THAT THIS MOVE IS TAKING THE MAIN STORY ARC OF THE STAR WARS SAGA AS A WHOLE; Lukes character was most dissapointing."
"488",5,"  A great movie! Exciting and not predictable! From the first viewing entered the number of the most loved! The problem of all the critics is that they do not want to let go of the past. This film is the bright future of the saga! Excellent!"
"489",1,"  Total garbage. First site I've ever seen that allows the rating from ""ignore"" to 5 stars, yet ""ignore"" and 1/2 stars DOESN'T count ?? absolutely unbelievable and unprofessional. Not mention that the vast mayority of voters doesn't know that so the result has nothing to do with the actual voting ??"
"490",0.5,"  ""91% critic score"" tells me that the critic scores are rigged and that none of them are familiar with the Star Wars universe."
"491",0.5,"  Horrible, thanks for ruining Star Wars."
"492",0.5,"  This film breaks fundamental narrative rules, lacks character arc, emotion, and wastes its time on several pointless subplots. Ultra-progressive in underlying themes and its protagonist is the greatest ""Mary Sue"" in the history of filmmaking. Disney has failed the fans and destroyed this franchise."
"493",0.5,"  The worst movie I have ever seen. I would rather just watch sharknado again. (Same movie concept so bad your supposed to laugh right) oh wait..."
"494",1,"  Esta pelicula casi me da un infarto porque no pude creer toda la mierda que estaba viendo"
"495",4,"  The film is good for a general movie. It is MEH for a Star Wars flick. I would say that if it didn't waste time with some parts then it would be better. I think that it deserves a solid 80%. Screw you if you are going to complain and say, ""Ooh, I think that it is a downgrade, as it is a bit bad compared to the other films."" It is amazing. Just, don't see it in IMAX or IMAX 3D, as there is no difference if you do experience it in a special format."

"500",1,"  Espero que no saquen m√°s....gracias Star wars perdistes a un fan"
"501",0.5,"  Disney really killed the Star Wars series by creating this movie, as well as the 7th. Please tell me that you can see that the 7th and 8th are exactly like the 4th and 5th, there is even a snow planet in the 8th, just like the 5th. Furthermore, the terrible humor made me choke on my popcorn, meaning I chocked many times. This isn't a dumb animation like the fucken Emoji movie, which by the way was terrible. Luke, Poe, Finn, and Ray's funny lines were fine, but what made me want to commit harakiri was when Lea started talking about her hair when she saw her brother for the first time in at least 10 years. Also, I know star wars is a SiFi and also has the force, but I think that someone surviving outer space and not dying from that blast like Lea did is really pushing the boundaries. To be honest, It would have made more sense if she had died there. Snoke's death was very anticlimactic and you can see the similarity between his and Palpatine's death in the 6th, where they both trusted their followers to do their work. You would think that the new Supreme Leader would have been smart enough to figure out that he connected Ray and Kylo too close so that their bond was strong. The French guy who turned on Fin and Rose, who by the way didn't really do much in the film, was probably the most creative character. We can't celebrate for Disney just yet, because the smuggler guy turned Finn and Rose in just as Lando Calrissian did to Han Solo in the 8th. I believe Disney messed up by not killing either Rose or Finn in the final scene where she saves him. Rose was a useful character up to the point that they were in battle, and there are too many main characters to live. The fact that Captain Phasma may have fallen to her death is unlikely, but if she did, that is really stupid on your part Disney. In final, I could get a bunch of guys who just do dumb Coca Cola commercials and have them make a more creative star wars than disney. First, they even kept the snow planet from the 4th, how can you be that much of a dumbass? Second, the repetitive death of the Supreme Leader, which came from the 6th. Hey, Rain Johnson, did you just copy the script from the 5th, add some its of the 6th and then use higher budget animations? Because if you did that, you did it right. I hope Karry Fisher, bless her soul, didn't see her scene with the hair thing, because I think she would have quit on the spot. Finally, I can't believe you dumb ass movie judges rated this movie a 91% and rated Jumper only 16%. At least that movie is original."
"502",0.5,"  This movie is a complete travesty. All the individuals from the original trilogy are completely out of character and act nothing like they did in the originals. Their legacies get completely trashed. The movie tried so hard to be artsy and deep, but did it so blatantly obviously that all it wound up being was deeply annoying. The plot is a complete mess with random tangents all over the place that don't serve to progress the movie or characters at all. It was disheartening to see how some of my favorite characters were portrayed in this film, and the sad thing is that this can now not be undone. I don't know how this screenplay got the green light from Disney, but this movie has effectively ruined Star Wars for me and a lot of other people I know. I will likely never watch another Disney Star Wars movie after this one because I frankly don't care anymore. I wish I could give this movie negative stars, but 1/2 a star will have to do."
"503",2,"  I waited until the movie came out on DVD and only watched once. I am not a hard-core fan, but I grew up with and loved the original trilogy. I had mixed opinions on the prequels, Force Awakens, and Rogue One. I critiqued Force Awakens for being somewhat of a re-hash with silly progressive maneuvers in tokenism. 1.) The progressive agenda that I mildly disliked in Force Awakens and Rogue One was doubled-down in this movie to an intolerable degree. The identity politics in casting became distracting, as if the director wanted to emphasize just how many women and people of color are in the Resistance. 2.) On a separate note, the desire for ""a twist at every turn"" and subvert fandom became jarring. Established elements and tropes of prior movies were discarded, much like a ""laser sword"" with and elitist disgust. 3.) The use of BB-8 and Porgs became increasingly less clever throughout the movie and were clearly watered-down advertisements. 4.) If the 3 or more story-lines were episodes of a Netflix series, the audience score would be much higher. However, instead of episodes, the disparate plots were thinly connected by a handful of scenes and billed as a single movie."
"504",2,"  If Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy came to bury Star Wars, and not enliven it, then their spark will light the fire that will burn the whole galactic edifice down. Little to no hope that JJ Abrams can restore any sense of fun or hope or mystery to this franchise in Episode Whatever. The porgs are cute, though."
"505",2,"  While rather good in general, a lot of pointless small characters take away our attention of the big story, sometimes killing the mood. The Force is treated as something it's not originally, only Yoda's words make sense in SW8. Great acting mostly but too many bugs in the science and the action scenes. The CGI is breathtaking but was expected to be. To sum up: this movie didn't bring anything new and both the big bad guy and the big nice guy died... in an none epic way... which was lame to say the least..."
"506",0.5,"  This sad iteration of the first Star Wars movie is filled with weak attempts at humor, overshadowed by political overtones leading one to question if there is anything left sacred from a time when humans were allowed to simply enjoy themselves rather than be forcibly ""educated"" regarding the apparent flaws in their political views. Thumbs down...way down."
"507",1,"  Huge plot holes, entire storylines and characters tossed aside like garbage, and a cringe-worthy, prequel-style sequence on a gambling planet that led nowhere and ruined the pacing of the film."
"508",1,"  Just bad in so many ways."
"509",1,"  sorry it just wasn't that good...disappointed."
"510",1,"  I don't know who pays these critics but they should be ashamed for pretending that this movie was anything but horrible.... I also feel bad for the actors... this movie has probably ended their careers."
"511",0.5,"  movie ruined my fandomPUZZLING plot holes and puzzling plot. 1) The fill in general for princess leia of the rebels doesnt tell her team where they going as they are running out of fuel? why not just tell her team instead of causing unnecessary suspicion. 2) the first order could've just lightspeed ahead and destroy them 3) destroyed luke's character and growth 4) casino scene just a random distraction. I enjoyed some star wars but this one kind of killed it for me."
"512",0.5,"  The Original Trilogy is the band before they got famous, Kennedy's Trilogy is the band after they got signed by the big label and sold out.they used to write songs about taking down the system. Now they are the system."
"513",0.5,"  Absolute disgrace to the fan base"
"514",1,"  Visual effects and acting were on point, however the story line is lacking any character development for the new characters, and treats the old characters as objects to be discarded."
"515",0.5,"  I loved all the star wars movie except this one. It was boring, poorly written, overrated, cheesy, did not make sense, bad acting, cash grab. The overwhelming positive review from the critics really makes me question their motivations because I do not believe the majority of them enjoyed it so much."
"516",5,"  Well, all I have to say is a huge ""THANK YOU"" to Rian Johnson for not making another dump down enough movie for stupids with no life to like! The Last Jedi is visually stunning, it goes deep into it's characters' journey, especially with Kylo Ren, it is well-crafted and it deviates from the black-white perpsective of George Lucas' original trilogy! I am so glad we can finally see some depth in an overly simplistic franchise, and I say that as a Star Wars fan, though with a broader knowledge in film studies! Yes we all love it because it was part of our childhood, but the Last Jedi was the first movie in this franchise that didn't make you feel like a 12 year old... Again, thank you Rian Johnson! Don't worry, this will go down as one of the best films up in the franchise!"
"517",4,"  I thought it might be good, but I never would have guessed that it would be better than Rogue One, and almost better than Empire Strikes Back! For me, most Star Wars films are 1-3 stars with Empire being the exception (5 star)."
"518",5,"  By far the best Star Wars Movie!"
"519",1,"  male critics: if you can't find the balls to pan this movie, at least be a good ally and shut up."
"520",1,"  I could go on and on about all that's wrong with this movie, but I think enough people have already. This just isn't a bad ""Star Wars"" movie, it's a bad movie period. I loved every Star Wars movie that came before this, but The Last Jedi is an insult to anyone with a brain."
"521",0.5,"  This is not recognizable as Star Wars in any way. Horrible script with none of spirit of the originals."
"522",1,"  Una horrible secuela sin inspiraciÛn y tambi√©n una horrible historia"
"523",1,"  Esta pel√≠cula se perjudico solo y no dir√© nada mas"
"524",0.5,"  you can understand a person's iq or age according the opinion about that movie."
"525",2,"  nothing makes sense, random shit doing random things everywhere"
"526",3.5,"  This movie is messy in terms of execution and writing as the Casino subplot is the worst part of this film. It seems to distract from the other plots which one is going at a slow pace and the other is trying to develop the main characters. Many of the elements from ""The Force Awakens"" could have been built up but instead were wasted opportunities or ignored. The acting from the cast though is top notch and CGI, for the most part, was good. The use of colours and shots during fight sequences are great. The musical score by John Williams is always lovely to hear.Even though there are questions that the movie brings up and doesn't answer it's not a bad movie. It does make me wonder what will happen in IX."
"527",5,"  ""You failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me.""When I was a boy, watching Return of the Jedi on VHS, I began to realize I was watching something more than just a grand spectacle with action and adventure. By the end of that film Luke Skywalker saves the day, not by blowing something up or wielding a light sabre. Instead, he throws his sword away and sacrifices himself. He does something that most cinematic heroes do not do. He forgoes violence and puts his faith in the humanity found in the destructive and corrupt monster he was meant to slay. Learning that the entertaining action film I was watching was also a story of forgiveness and redemption, left a mark on me at a young age. I believe it is why my love of the Star Wars films endured into my adulthood.In the Last Jedi, Rian Johnson also succeeds in his attempt to create a movie that was more than just an adolescent spectacle. He does give us a film with desperate space battles, wondrous creatures and emotional duels with laser swords. However, he also takes the time to create an unexpected journey for each of the main characters. In this film the reckless hotshot doesn't get to be the hero with a foolhardy act of youthful bravado that ignores the costs of war. The hard-driven general, who has always been the strongest soldier no matter what the cruel galaxy takes from her, finally feels the burden of all she has lost. The survivalist learns why he must sacrifice. And in this saga, the villain and the hero are left with no clear quest or mentors to guide them. The film ends with Luke Skywalker saving the day in a unique and unexpected twist that upon reflection is very familiar. Like in Return of the Jedi, he does not use his laser sword or grab or push something with the force. But instead, through an act of sacrifice and faith, he inspires a new galaxy of heroes and redeems himself.The Last Jedi did not go the way I thought. It was a more complicated, daring and complete film and it will hopefully leave a mark on young fans for a lifetime."
"528",1,"  Just awful! It has a terrible script, directing and the acting was just plain awful. My god you would think this was Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher's first movie.I could only make it 40 minutes, then had to shut it off. Please stop making these, There is nothing to see here!!"
"529",1,"  If good cinematography, good effects (even the sea-cow was well executed), good acting and a good musical score could rescue an atrocious story then this rating would be higher, but they can't. The tragedy is that it wouldn't have taken a lot of tweaking to fix most of the problems with the story."
"530",0.5,"  So much just doesn't make sense and why is half the script just full of jokes? Star wars was never a comedy but seems to be now. Disney were saying it was going to be the darkest star wars ever."
"531",0.5,"  maybe the special effects is good. but the story, and the treatment of the characters i love for years really hurts me. rian Johnson congratulations you just ruined my childhood. well i don't care anymore about what happened at episodes 9. so sad"
"532",1,"  Anyone else notice how every positive review of TLJ is some vague, boring-ass variation of ""it was bold! It was different!"" that manages to avoid any meaningful justification - whereas the legion negative reviews are scathingly precise, passionately written and chock-filled with specific examples of why the movie sucked. We all know the truth - TLJ was a confused, poorly executed film that was more concerned with potty jokes and lazy ""gotcha!"" plot beats than actual storytelling. Any critic worth their salt knows this too, but they can't say anything for fear of going against the prevailing social justice groupthink of hollywood. Critics are facing a major credibility crisis (as is Rotten Tomatoes). More of them are becoming bought-and-paid-for corporate shills scared to ""toe the party line"". They prize ideology over art (storytelling) and that's a VERY dangerous place to be. Hope they're prepared to be not taken seriously anymore. Lastly, I'll say I have ZERO problem with socially progressive themes in sci fi - after all, that's always been a hallmark of the genre - however Rian Johnson presents his social justice themes with all the subtlety and nuance of a fifth grader (disposable C-plot with a black and female asian, disproportionate number of strong female characters, weak or buffoonish male characters needing the guidance of said females). Come on Rian! These feel so obvious and forced that they insult your audience's intellect - and ultimately serve to distract, not enhance, your story."
"533",1.5,"  I watched a few older movies tonight and thinking of this Last Jedi makes me mad how bad this is, the fake camaraderie between Poe Dameron and the black guy, when re-watching it tonight I'm back to again lower my score"
"534",5,"  Great emotional experience. Great Star Wars movie. I just can't get enough. <3Thank you."
"535",2,"  A very dissapointed movie, worst movie among the star wars saga!!!!"
"536",2,"  Political correctness gets in the way of good story telling. casino side quest pointless, luke's death is lame and the character just seem weak, mutiny could have been avoided with basic communication from leadership, battles were as silly as the bad guys. throne room light sabre fight ok but overshadowed by weird scenes like mary poppins leia and alien milk luke with nurse maids. what are you doing to the franchise disney?"
"537",0.5,"  This movie has no protagonist, is riddled with plot holes, can't possibly be a sequel to the previous instalment, makes the already terrible Star Wars franchise that much worse.I didn't think it possible, but it manages to be the very worst film in the whole franchise. Not an easy feat."
"538",0.5,"  Worst movie I have seen in my entire lifel"
"539",1.5,"  This movie is a disgrace to the rest of the franchise"
"540",0.5,"  Pretty much ruined Star Wars. Terrible movie with gaping plot holes all throughout that pays no attention to established rules and lore in the other movies."
"541",5,"  This is a great movie, I enjoyed"
"542",4,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a beautiful vision to behold that is full of tension, thrills and the occasional laugh."
"543",1,"  I WALKED OUT ACTUALLY SAYING THE MOVIE WAS STUPID (WHICH I'VE NEVER DONE FOR ANY STAR WARS MOVIE EVER) AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS I JUST SAW. CAUSE IT WASN'T STAR WARS."
"544",0.5,"  Rolled my eyes like 3 times in this movie, makes me not want to even go to Disney star wars park anymore"
"545",2,"  The trailers made me think the movie would be different but it turned out even worse then force awakens. Ruining beloved characters and killing all theories. Hope episode 9 turns it around"
"546",5,"  The online hate for this film does not reflect the critics praise around the world, the A rating on CinemaScore and it certainly does not reflect my view of this film that I have now seen 3 times. One of which was at a press screening a week before it came out with about 10 people, to a packed house that following Thursday. A house that cheered multiple times, I might add. Look, opinions are your own...and you are entitled to them...but some of the comments make me think you do not know this franchise. The Last Jedi is a beautiful film with rich performances by a stellar cast. I gave it an A on BatmanOnFilm and it is now an A+. Below is my initial review, but all I can say is go see it. See it TWICE! And if you read novels growing up, throw those out. Sorry, that is not canon for these films. The Last Jedi is a masterpiece, don't believe toxic fandom. SYNOPSIS: In Lucasfilm's STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, the Skywalker saga continues as the heroes of THE FORCE AWAKENS join the galactic legends in an epic adventure that unlocks age-old mysteries of the Force and shocking revelations of the past.I just arrived home from my second screening of Rian Johnson's THE LAST JEDI (AKA STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII) and all I can think about is this coming up Sunday when I am scheduled to see the movie again.After my Monday press screening (thanks to BOF founder/editor-in-chief Bill ""Jett"" Ramey), I felt a bit disoriented. The film did not resonate with me in the way that I wanted it to, nor did the characters go in the direction I wanted them to go in.But after that second viewing, I get it...100% get it.Rian Johnson is a genius. We are in good hands for his future, non-Skywalker centric trilogy too, I might add.If you have ever read my movie reviews on BOF, you know that I don't do the typical formula where I break down the film for you. Rather, I tell you how the film made me feel. I can tell you is that I feel like I just had an experience at a Star Wars film that will resonate with me for many years to come.Some of my quibbles from Monday still remain. A couple of major characters were somewhat wasted. And, as amazingly badass as they were, the constant battle sequences wore a bit thin after a while. Still, the cast makes this a Star Wars experience for the ages.I absolutely love what director Johnson, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley did with Kylo and Rey. Their next chapter will be one that will give me more grey hairs, since I have to wait another 2 years for it!Poe (Oscar Isaac) is becoming this trilogy's Han Solo, with this heroic swagger and anti-authority demeanor...and I cannot wait to see what JJ Abrahams does with him in EPISODE IX.But the runaway star is Mark Hamill.He shows us an older, broken Luke. A Luke more cynical than brave, but with the eyes of a man in a perpetual struggle to be both.Rian's script is full of heart, humor, depth and true character studies. And his directing allows his script to breathe and for his actors to embrace said material with razor sharp artistic precision.As much as I love THE FORCE AWAKENS, it is fair to say it was very much a love letter to George Lucas' original film, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE. THE LAST JEDI isn't a love letter to anyone or anything. But rather a labor of love, compliments of Johnson and company.It is fresh. Bold. Original. And incredibly brave.Unlike its predecessor, it feels like a continuation of all the films before it. ALL of them. Yes, including the prequels - and that is a GOOD thing.I read someone say (and I'm paraphrasing) that THE LAST JEDI was the first Star Wars film that wasn't just about growing up, but rather growing old. I 100% agree. With this being Carrie Fisher's last performance, that sentiment rings even more true (some of her scenes will give you chills!).Perhaps that is why this chapter in the Skywalker saga resonates with me more so than any Star Wars film has in years. Not only is it surprisingly unique and unexpected, but it is also incredibly poignant.At one point in the film, Luke looks at Rey and says, ""This is not going to go the way, you think!"" Listen to Luke.Go see this film. Hell, go see it multiple times.I look forward to writing more about it; as well as discussing it on an upcoming BOF podcast where we can all peel back the onion together after everyone gets a chance to see it.Until then, May the Force Be With You and...PORGS! - Rick ShewGRADE: A"
"547",0.5,"  Another classic destroyed by radical feminists."
"548",5,"  I watched this in the theater then rented at home, through here and all the negative reviews are from people who did not understand this movie, or did not want it to go their way. This movie is way better than I thought watching it the second time, without all the preconceived biases I had because of all the negativity around it. Watching it with an open mind, not only is this a great movie, but it is most defiantly a Star Wars movie and holds true to the Star Wars paradigm! Don't let the naysayers distract you from watching this great movie and forming a preconceived bias against it. Rotten Tomatoes has the critics at 91% saying it is a great movie, and they are right!"
"549",1,"  One of the worst movies every made...I regret spending money to see this garbage."
"550",5,"  this is a really greatly written and directed movie, the only problem is the canto bight scenes that felt out of place from star wars. I feel like some of the decisions might either anger or please fans. it completely changes star wars as it is the most unique star wars yet. I t seriously plays against your expectations so i suggest you should go in with 0 expectations. My 3rd favorite star wars film and possibly my favorite film of the year. BTW, haters, go screw off. I give this film 5 out of 5 just to aggregate you guys like you did with the people you aggregated for loving this movie."
"551",3.5,"  I'm a super fan of Star Wars, but the latest one was a bit disappointing. Killing the former characters? Really? Not much creativity happening neither. I think is time to re-watch the 1970's and 80's again and get the spirit of what Star Wars is about."
"552",0.5,"  Terribly disappointed in this movie."
"553",0.5,"  Movie was absolutely awful. So glad I didn't pay money to see this in the theatres... Obviously the rotten tomatoes""critics"" were paid off to write a good review."
"554",3.5,"  This was such a horrendous mistake. From the beginning to the end. This was clearly a case of SJW work that ran amoke. The story was horrible, the characters were horrible outside of checking off the diversity boxes it should be scrapped from the universe all together. Actually so should be the last one. This movie combined with awakens officially killed Star Wars for me. I don't care if they ever mak another. I was hoping after the really good Rouge One this might turn the corner but politics destroyed this move and franchise."
"555",1.5,"  wowowowowowoo greatest movie ever man i like how they made a specific character to for every stereotipe/race/sexuality it was especially good when they made the asain girl and fin kiss that felt like the perfect time for that i totally didnt just want them to be associates. but then again maybe we'll have an orgy in the next stay trek movie"
"556",2,"  There were some cool parts, but what is the purpose of making a movie, calling it a Star Wars movie, and then claiming that you were making a NOT Star Wars movie? Just make your own SciFi movie then!"
"557",1,"  God-Awful! The Crystal Skull of Star Wars...does not exist in the Star Wars Universe! Redo it!!!"
"558",1,"  Absolute garbage. Love star wars prior to this fIlm. This movie should be deleted from the star waRs franchise. There is no way excePt through blatant Bribery and corruption any critIc couLd possibly give this a positive review. If you love star waRs, stay away from this film...it will ruin your star wars Passion."
"559",5,"  Will go down as one of the greats"
"560",3.5,"  Generally had a very fun experience at the theater the two times I went to see it. But I have to admit there a lot of unanswered questions as well. What sticks out to me is a fantastic choreographed fight scene involving Kylo and Rey (trying not to mention spoilers) replete with cheering and raucous shouts from the theater audience! There are a lot of surprises in this film, and it needs to be given some credit for that...even if a few might be disappointing to long time fans."
"561",0.5,"  I don't think I've ever had how bad a movie is so completely explained to me and yet, upon viewing the movie realize that the level of terrible within it was understated as with The Last Jedi. I thought I'd come out going, ""It wasn't great, but y'all way oversold this."" but no! I was so wrong. Holy shit..."
"562",1,"  Only five minutes or so out of over two hours train wreck felt anything like a true Star Wars movie.The acting was forced. The dialog insipid. At no point did this piece of crap make me care about any of the characters. No mourning over Han's death?The actor who played Poe Dameron was ridiculously over the top and, somehow wooden at the same time. He has been good in other films (such as Sucker Punch), but his rapidly bouncing emotional reactions made me wonder if he earned his acting degree through a correspondence course. In short...Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars.It was not even worth the price of a RB rental."
"563",0.5,"  Just awfulPoor acting, subplots that are bad lacking real emotion. Jokes that just flop. Luke's character failed to deliver in the end. The movie was overly preachy, weak dialog, and failed characters."
"564",0.5,"  This movie is worse then the Ghostbusters remake. At least Star wars is now officially dead. I hope Georgie enjoys his new mansions."
"565",4.5,"  It isn't without story-related flaws, but the latest entry in the ""Star Wars"" franchise is so incredibly unpredictable and ambitious that I just can't not love it."
"566",1,"  disappointing: NOT QUITE AS APPALLING AS THE PREQUELS BUT MAKES THE FORCE AWAKENS loOK PROFICIENT BY COMPARISON. BAD SCRIPT AND DIRECTION. WEAK CHARACTERS. TEDIOUS AND INCOHERENT, GREAT WASTE OF POTENTIAL."
"567",5,"  Much the same way Empire Strikes Back was a character play that took a deep dive into all of the original characters and their relationships with one another, so too is The Last Jedi, which takes us on Rey's journey of self discovery. I thought the pace was good, and the action sequences were quite satisfying. I liked how conflicted Luke was, thought the cameo appearance of Yoda was appropriate and well written, and overall thought this movie was a great ""passing of the torch""... Looking forward to the next one!"
"568",1.5,"  As an avid star wars fan, I've been waiting 2 years for this sequel to finally happen and after leaving the theater, I was a little bit disappointed in what the end result we got with this long awaited sequel. J.J. Abrams set up that cliffhanger at the end of The Force Awakens only for Rian Johnson to take it and throw it off the cliff (literally!). every scene on the island was terrible and now ""force skype"" suddenly exists between rey and kylo ren supposedly. however they did add a new interesting new ability about the force where you can hologram yourself from thousands of lightyears away however using it too much can kill you. I hate how they handled the characters in this film and the film itself didn't quite have the same tone as it did with the force awakens except for the first scene on the island playing the music from the previous film during the scene. the humour was abit off especially how they kept using general hux as a punching bag in almost every scene he is in. I thought the whole Canto Bight Casino scene was pointless and too long. Out off all the time they had to exclude that whole scene, they could've answered the questions that us (the audience) had when we left the theaters from The Force Awakens such as who are rey's parents? who is snoke and where did he come from? (which by the way don't get your hopes up because he gets killed off with no story and his death leads to probably one of the best most unlikely lightsaber partnership duel massacres in the entire franchise only when you think kylo ren has finally reached the light, he decides hes bad again after literally helping a foe fight off his own side. Plus there were moments that. And Luke Skywalker was not the Luke a Skywalker I remembered from the Original Trilogy. He was grouchy and every scene he felt obligated and forced (no pun intended) to be in the film. I found the Rose character to be extremely annoying and she would not leave finn alone and give him space to breathe ever in this film. I understand this movie is meant mostly to kids but even films like this can appeal to adults (especially adults who grew up during the original trilogy). I don't hate the film because of the direction they were trying to go (I did like how they were trying to do something different and i'll give them props for that) I just hate how this film was poorly thought out and written. even mark Hamill said that he hated and disagreed with what rian Johnson did with his character. especially how considering in the original trilogy how despite how evil darth vader was, he knew and saw a little bit of good still left in him. however in this film he senses the dark side in kylo ren (who was ben solo at the time of this scene) and he tries to murder him in his sleep. that's not luke skywalker. anyway since jj abrams is back in the director's seat for episode ix, I hope he corrects all the mistakes that rian Johnson made with this film and redeem this franchise before it gets any worse. anyway I hope they learn from this film and move forward. I haven't lost all faith in star wars (yet). I cant wait to see what episode ix has in store in 2019 to conclude the trilogy"
"569",2,"  The film just did not do it for me - mainly because nothing really changes for the characters from beginning to end. You could essentially skip this film and go straight to Episode 9 without missing much."
"570",5,"  A truly great movie. Watch it twice because you may have missed some of the important nuances that take place throughout the movie."
"571",0.5,"  An awful Movie with some awful moments and missed opportunities ..A terrible Star Wars movie ..Rian Johnson ruined jj abrahms good work ..now jj has to reboot the reboot."
"572",5,"  So much nice stories of love, friendship, determination, believe in yourself, not many light saber duels."
"573",1,"  the most disappointing movie ive ever gone to see in a cinema"
"574",2,"  It's just an alright cheesy movie with a bratty villain."
"575",0.5,"  I GREW UP WITH STAR WARS AND HAVE BEEN A FAN SINCE 1977. I LOVE THE OT, EVEN WITH IT NOT BEING PERFECT AND SOME CORNYNESS. THE PREQUEL TRILOGY FILMS WERE OKAY BUT I FELT REVENGE OF THE SITH DID A GREAT JOB. THE NEW TRILOGY THOUGH, WASN'T A BIG FAN OF FORCE AWAKENS BUT IT WAS OKAY. THE LAST JEDI IS A MESS. IT RUINS LUKE SKYWALKER AND RUINS THE SET UP FROM TFA. THE FILM ADDS THROW AWAY CHARACTERS AND ACTS LIKE TFA AND TLJ ARE TWO DIFFERENT FILMS WITH TLJ TOSSING AWAY PLOTLINES FROM ITS PREDECESSORS (BETTERS). THE CRITIC RATINGS ON THIS FILM IS ABYSMAL AND TRULY IS ABOUT PANDERING TO DISNEY."
"576",0.5,"  Outright disrespectful to the Star Wars Universe. Cracking unfunny jokes taking nothing serious. Destroying old plots and filled with women characters that do nothing and politically correct values. This is not what the star wars brand is about. Clearly Disney is at the helm and high paid woman are driving the ship."
"577",0.5,"  This makes Attack of the Clones look like a masterpiece."
"578",2,"  That was A very boring and disappointing movie, acting was Just OK BUT THE Script Was shit. A directionslESS STory, confused PLottS AND STUPID subtext with ODD MEssages (BURN BOOKS??) . IT IS HARD TO CONNECT TO ANY CHaRACTEr SHOWN, NO DEPER UNDERSTANDING FOR REAL EMOTIONs AND NOT in TOuch WITH THE ESTABSLISED UNIVERSE ON THE WHOLE. IT IS A SHAME."
"579",0.5,"  one of the worst star wars movies ever"
"580",1,"  Estuve en mi casa viendo esta porqueria........ ahora tengo pena ajena"
"581",0.5,"  Me dieron una porqueria sin piedadddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd mierda mierda"
"582",1,"  Boring - like REALLY BORING"
"583",4,"  Existen una pelÌcula que sabe arruinar franquicias... esta es una de ellas"
"584",1,"  Lo m√°s horrible que he visto y miren que soy fanatico de Star wars fue un espanto esta pelicula"
"585",1.5,"  I honestly think that the only good things about this movie were Luke,the scene with Yoda,and Rey and Kylo fighting the guards."
"586",0.5,"  No por favor dejen de arruinar franquicias amadas por el publico por favorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
"587",3,"  I expected more than episode 7, but not this much!!!!! GEEZIt's like they wanted to wrap up the franchise and call it a day. Some still kinda made up for it."
"588",2,"  2 points for great visuals - some of the shots are amazing.Everything else in this movie is absolutely awful. It's probably even worse then 'The Force Awakens'"
"589",2,"  Too many plot holes and the story unravels miserably when simply tugged at the seams. This says nothing for the absolute travesty of transforming an icon of hope and good, spanning over 40 years, into a milk-drinking hack. In dark theaters, lit by the light of this movie, is where childhoods go to die."
"590",5,"  It's a great movie! Funny, creative, and full of meaning."
"591",1,"  This movie doesn't just suck as a star wars movie but fails as a movie entirely. Made absolutely no sence and was utterly boring."
"592",0.5,"  This movie SUCKS! it has nothing to do with star wars. Kathleen Kennedy must be fired! This shit made me disconnected from the franchise."
"593",2,"  I grew up with the original trilogy. After an initial 32 year waiting to see luke and getting ripped off by force awakens, then another two to see him in his full glory, we get the last jedi. not only were there no big space battles, let a lone a bona fides lightsaber fight or two, but luke is, to put it too politely, underwhelming. This movie elevated the prequels, and vaulted return of the jedi to the best one of the eight episodes simply because of the missed opportunity with luke. what a shame. it did have some good individual moments and a good soundtrack. my interest in episode iX & beyond is minimal because of this movie."
"594",1.5,"  kind of pointless but great visuals"
"595",0.5,"  Boring and lazy with more politics than three hours of C Span and worse jokes than Spaceballs. I hear they are making another one in three years......I got a bad feeling about this."
"596",3,"  fulfills the necessary action and emotion, but fails to make something intelligent."
"597",0.5,"  Half the film is the rebels in a ship slowly trying to escape from the first order, then there is this side plot that doesn't change the plot at all where they are in a casino planet and last but not least Luke being a dick to everyoneStar wars: Rian Johnson ruined my childhood"
"598",0.5,"  Remeber all those great classic characters you loved? They ruined them. Honestly worse than the prequels. At least with the prequels you can laugh at how bad they are, with this movie, you cry."
"599",5,"  ""Let The Past Die. Kill It, If You Have To.""Rian Johnson is able to bring the saga in to our current intellectual time age. The rediscovery of themes like duality, transcendence and egolessness was something needed for the Star Wars saga to move forward. Like George did with the original trilogy, this movie will bring joy and wisdom to the younger generations who in a long term will be able to grasp these concepts. Again if youre stucked in the past, meaning (an unwillingness to grasp and integrate old important values from a childhood long gone and bringing them forward and developing them to the current adult mind in a post-rational era), this movie will seem totally irrelevant. As Luke Skywalker goes from the heroic young and innocent into the dark night of the soul only to discover boundaryless enlightenment, so should we the audience. Going from the light to the darknes, from darkness to light, creating grey, creating light, and landing in emptyness again. Star Wars is again relevant. Looking forward to the upcoming films."
"600",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars movie by far. Rian failed fans."
"601",5,"  Best movie i've seen in a very very long time."
"602",1,"  The Last Jedi is Disney's Order 66 on longtime Star Wars fans. ""Hunt them down. Round them up. Annihilate them.""It's also Order 66 on the Original Trilogy, and three of the most iconic characters in film history: Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Luke Skywalker. You can throw in Chewbacca, Yoda, 3PO and R2 for that matter.TLJ is a complete, insulting nothing. Absolute waste of space.TFA and TLJ tease what everyone really wanted to see, which was Luke's Jedi academy, training, good Kylo, his fall to the Dark Side, the Knights of Ren, destroying the Jedis-in-training and leaving Luke for dead. That should have been Episode 7. It would have been effing fantastic. But, no, we get the cock tease otherwise known as The Force Awakens, followed by The Last Jedi, which douses the audience in ice water and then throws the saga into the abyss.After the fall of Kylo in Episode 7, Episode 8 could be the fall of the New Republic after a surprise assault from the outer regions by Snoke and the First Order. Galactic warfare and desolation on a Titanic scale (instead of the slow speed search for a petrol dump the Last Jedi took). The Force Awakens, Rey comes to the forefront, Han Solo dies.In Episode IX they would be set up for the grand finale between Luke, Rey, Kylo, and whatever other baddie Abrams has planned.Point is, they could have the story go in the same direction as they intended all along, but not fuck the fans with crap movies while getting there.TLJ is gutter trash, and pulls TFA into the sewer with it. By the way, I watched the deleted scenes for free online, and they flesh out nothing, are completely awful, and deserved to be cut, along with almost every scene that actually made it into the movie."
"603",2,"  New characters are dull and unlikeable. I just can't find a reason to root for them. Rey is a shake-and-bake jedi. Ridiculous action scenes. It was a decent sci-fi movie but a far cry from genuine Star Wars."
"604",1,"  Agree with audience ratings. B rated movie at best. Special effects almost pre-star wars... Disney is doing the series an injustice! So disappointed."
"605",3.5,"  Finally broke down and watched this travesty.. disliked EVERYTHING about this film from butchering original characters to infusing SJW themes and ideals to watering down the specialness of the powers that separated jedis from being something years of dedication and discipline required to just being feelings and hope.. and come on princess lies showing not a single sign of force ability her ENTIRE life can just suddenly force push herself through space and survive the vacuum and coldness of space because of feelings?? Smh.. good job liberal hollyweird you have killed a great franchise"
"606",1,"  I cringed the whole time. Its a poorly thought out kids movie, Loved the original star wars. This sucked."
"607",0.5,"  Horrific movie. ReallyBad acting by really ugly people. SeemsThey went out ofWay to get get ugly bad actors. The oldActors were exceptionally bad as well. Maybe that?s why they have not been seen in a movie since. Done with Star Wars. Should have stoppedAt 2."
"608",0.5,"  Doesn't fit in canon. Ackbar just dies an unceremonious death, Leia somehow flies in space, defying all previous canon which Disney disrespectfully destroyed. Should have used books as source material, instead we get this overhyped dribble.. Sad to think this may be John Williams last film. I also agree with Hamill when it comes to the direction Luke has supposedly taken, becoming one with the force. I don't think it was time and you risked losing the nostalgia factor, which you did. Props on the space battle scene in the beginning, phenomenal job with the sisters connection. I'm not a total snob! ;)"
"609",2,"  This is miles better than TFA, just setting JJ Abrams aside and keeping that monster from interfering, has produced a decent movie. There are no major continuity issues or incoherent scenes, so that's a great improvement over the mess of TFA. That said, the script remains quite bad. They keep making a copy of the original storyline, they spin it, switch it, repaint over it, but it's a poor choice nonetheless. The jokes seem misplaced, known characters seem out of character, and the new characters are not given anything to work with.Daisy Ridley is a treasure, and again they misuse her, wasting an incredible opportunity.One thing they do right is female representation, all movies of all genres should look like TLJ in that regard.However as a Star Wars flick, it's poor."
"610",1,"  Did not enjoy please bring JJ Abrams Back. They ruined this movie so bad. Corney One liners, predictable and the worst acting seen in years.How the Critics gave it Fresh Tomatoes i have no clue (they were Paid for sure or watched a different movie)"
"611",0.5,"  This movie doesn't even merit 1/2 Star, but it's the least I could give it without looking like I forgot to give it a star rating. I've been a Star Wars fan for 33 years, but this movie has officially killed the saga for me. Politics, animal rights, and child abuse commentary combined with terrible acting, dreadfully worthless story lines, and dialogue such as ""we won't win by fighting what we hate, we'll win by saving what we love"" make for 152 minutes of eye rolling. This movie stars Luke Skywalker playing the role of Mark Hammil, as well as a cast of totally forgettable supporting actors with no chemistry. Go home Star Wars, you're drunk. Never, ever let Rian Johnson near Star Wars again, please."
"612",3.5,"  There are a lot of things about this movie that I disagree with, and a lot of moments that fall flat, I still enjoyed this movie nonetheless."
"613",3.5,"  This was an O.K. movie. Some very poor decisions were made, but I can forgive most of it. Seeing Puppet Yoda again was more than worth what the rest of the movie put me through."
"614",5,"  This was a great film don't care what the audience scores are I loved it. Sad that Luke had do go but at least his end didn't feel rushed like Han solos was. Definitely can say I loved this movie, but I guess star wars fans will be star wars fans. All who cling on too tightly to the past with out excepting the new story. I had my doubts at first because of the way force awakens was, but I have to say the last jedi was amazing and should still be loved as much as the original trilogy not compared."
"615",0.5,"  This excuse of a movie should not even have the honor to be called a Star Wars movie. Just I thought it could not get worse. Total lack of scenario, of epicness, of star warsness. If you remove most of the story lines, it does not change anything in the movie (Finn whole storyline) and what is left is boring as well.The only interesting dialogue was between Luke and Leia at the end. It's the first time I'm disappointed enough in a movie to make myself a Rotten Tomatoes account just to rate a movie. Sadly, I have to give a minimum of half a star."

"617",1,"  Lousy. The story line as stupid!"
"618",1,"  It was obvious from the opening scene ""Your Mom"" joke that critics had been paid off to give positive reviews on this movie. This film is terrible. It's hard to really pin down one thing to hate over another so let's just sum it up to consistently poor writing."
"619",1.5,"  There are so many comedy moments and the main antagonist turns out to be a pushover. There are also many predictable events and very few surprises. Our heroes always get out of tough situations to the point that it gets old. I can barely recognize the saga that I know and love dearly. Unfortunately we just cant get rid of Fin, many more WOHOOOs to come unfortunately"
"620",2.5,"  Pro: Incredible art and visual effectsCons: Weak, clunky story, poor chemistry between Rose and Finn, and enough plot holes to fly a Mandator IV Siege Dreadnought through.Overall the movie gets a 'Meh' rating from me. It does not lend itself well to the Space Opera feel that Star Wars trilogies are famous for. Don't blame any of the actors and actresses in the least, they did the best they could with the garbage that Rian Johnson gave them. Btw, this opinion is held by my sister, a transwoman lesbian liberal, so no it wasn't catering to SJW. We also both agree that there is absolutely no way that Rey would not have fallen to the Dark Side, being raised as practically a slave, treated like garbage worse than Anakin was in the Phantom Menace, had 'friends' that betrayed her in that novel about three of the main characters. We both thought it would have been far more interesting an ending had she actually joined Kylo and a major twist no one at all would have expected.What Rian Johnson should be credited for is creating the dumbest female character in the entire Star Wars franchise (both cannon and Legends). I speak of course of Admiral Holdo, for if she just told SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND STAFF of the ship she just switched her flag to (Poe Dameron most specifically) what the plan was, Poe wouldn't have gotten Finn and Rose off the ship to find a slicer (Legends term for hacker) that eventually betrays them for money, caused the death of dozens if not hundreds of members of the Resistance."
"621",2,"  No meaningful answered questions from the Force Awakens, no Luke saber battle. Is Disney kidding me?? Rest was fine. I am a die hard life long Star Wars fan too!!"
"622",5,"  People dont know what there talking about it was aweosome if you dint like it you should not bought movie tickets maybe you youst like going to movies make fun of them you dont undrrstand im not the dreictor not you you dont work in Hollywood he tried he loves Star wars there more han just the fans its the people make the movie the actors get real Americana are stupid"
"623",0.5,"  It's as if the people who wrote and directed this movie never saw a Star Wars movie, including the Force Awakens. Just a truly awful movie. Pretty much kills the franchise - in the future I'm pretty sure people will consider the 'Star Wars' movies to just be the first six (the prequels might have been 'meh' - but this was awful and ignores things like continuity, plot, logic, and tone. I'd give it zero stars if that were possible. Half a star is because the music was Star Wars-esque."
"624",0.5,"  Even worse than episode 7...."
"625",0.5,"  I didn't mind the ""twists"", but for goodness sake. Has this man ever read a single Joesph Campbell book? By far the worst character arcs I have ever seen in a script of this magnitude. Was he required to write this in a weekend while on tons of ADHD meds?"
"626",4.5,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an enjoyable movie to watch. Not only did it keep my attention throughout, it kept me glued to the end of my seat. Sure it's not the best Star Wars movie, and some scenes were questionable, such as the scene where Leia flies through the air like superman, but other than that it was a well made movie. I would strongly recommend you to watch it."
"627",1,"  About - the last Jedi - a Spaceballs Saga / Guardians of the Galaxy / TransformersI can't believe we live in a world now where the prequels AREN'T the worst star wars movies anymore.Too much Disney - Mary Sue (Rey), Mary Poppins (Lea), Women's Power (all), Healing World, lame Evil Snok / Keylo / Hux, Love instead of War (Rose / Finn), many jokes to release danger for the young new spectators, cut animals to buy - too little Star Wars ...The movie is good for 10 year old kids who just want to see a fast / actually slow colorful space battle with cute animals, and do not understand an important good story.A Jedi Master who has been trained for years and saves his father Darh Vader, later wants to kill sleeping nephew with the lightsaber for bad thoughts?He's tired of hiding, but he's putting a card in circulation where he can be found?He throws his lightsaber over his shoulder and goes trinking milk by space cows?What does Luke think about Han Solo's death - nothing. What friendship has emerged over the years :-(Kylo - weep weep stomp stomp with his legs like a child - is a super evil? He kills his father and can not shoot his mother? Please take a look at the last 5 minutes of Rogue One - that's a badass Vader !!!Anyway, Rogue One gets more and more attention since WS8 is out, thank you very much for the new appreciation !!! Only good SW movie since - 1983 ( Prequels and TFA is o.k )The phone prank by Poe to Hux is not funny.R.I.P Admiral Ackbar - it's a trap - the Movie :-(What, in a galaxy far far away, there are still tickest because of parking wrong, the future is even darker :-(Finn in SW7 wants to flee and become a hero, Finn in SW 8 wants to flee and becomes a hero - well, almost his strange love comes between ?!Hux is Lord Helmet of Spaceballs - From now on, I'm not afraid of the new - Dark Side :-)The chase of spaceships is like one truck overtaking another.Spaceships need petrol stations ?Nobody Rey - beats decades of trained Jedi like Luke and Kylo Ren - without much training - WHAT? Soon finished Jedi wants to be born :-)Please consider, the movie plays 2 hours after TFA!The fight of Rey and Kylo against the bodyguards of Snoke, that should have been the best lightsaber fight in the Starwars universe at the 5 star reviewers ??? What was missing? Oh yes, no one uses the Force, only sword fight and take each other in a sweatbox, WTFLeah should have died in SW8 - instead of becoming a supergirl :-(You save animals but not slave children, niceDisney: You make rich people bad (casino plot) since you're poor?The new Star Wars should be - not only black and white - Here all men are stupid and all women are clever ?Beware BB-8 aka - the new Terminator - shoots coins, more than he is tall - funny ? NOAll characters are exactly 2.5 hours where they were at the beginning :-(The mighty Snok is dead? I do not care I do not really know him!The good thing is from now on, you can do all threatening things like dead stars, spaceships, evil planet, the new order, destroy by autopilot and hyper jump :-) We do not need Jedi more, and that just where everyone can become a Jedi, without effort, training, history, personal experiences and teachers ... :-(Look first Rogue One then a new Hope - and then SW7 / SW8 - you understand about Storyline?Good CGI technology does not replace a good story - it supports the storyWhat does Mark Hamill say about his new Luke role? It's not Luke's characterLuke Skywalker is so iconic that Mark Hamill only had voice roles in Hollywood movies since 1983. His 3 minutes in SW7 TFA was goose bumps with me. And now he dissolves in the air ???I am so sad Mark - I think of you as you were in my childhood, the greatest hero of all time :-)) May the force be with you ....ps: do not go back to Disney Star Wars.To Kathleen Kennedy :You look for strong women, look at 1977 - 83, Princess Lea was strong, she was not scared for Darth Vader, while everyone around him was shaking, she actively helps with her rescue. She is tortured by Darth Vader and later becomes active again in the fight for the rebelion. She strangles the mighty Jaba with her bare hands and a chain. She is always at the very front when fighting with laser pistols.R.I.P Carrie Fisheror... Felicity Jones aka Jyn Erso in Rogue One, I think I have seen that she is a strong woman and has grown with her duties. AND she had to teach, seek to make decisions, make decisions until her death - I felt with her!or think of Ripley aka Sigourney Weaver in Alien 1979And now there is - I can do anything right now Rey ... what a Stroyline. What did you want to tell the youth Disney?Hey kids life is great - everyone has the Force to use them without teaching, they bring you cola, chips and the joystick into your hands while you sit on the sofa, do not bother and do not forget to buy our toys :-)Look at the little boy at the end of the movie, he uses the power for his broom. Anakin was also a slave boy but what did he need to become jedi ???? Ahhhh years of training ....How do colored actors need political correctness - who is Billy Dee Williams - SW2 TESB 1980?By the way, how great would it have been if instead of Benicio Del Toro had played the hacker :-)Let the past die, kill it if you have to, said Disney :-) Well, congratulations you've killed the old premiere customers since 1977. I'm looking forward to the box office of Solo and SW9 :-)))Now aspiring film students write that TLJ would be a great movie. That means for me, the bad story writing in hollywood goes on :-( The force goes out ....In the past, 4-5 star reviewers wrote - what a great movie.Now you write - what a great movie with problems :-))Disney, please make the movie again based on TFA. You can kill the old heroes - but please with DIGNITY !!! You can take women and actors in the main roles of all countries - but with a good story, development and why they do something !!!Is that too much ?Hey you paid professional critics, that was probably bad, did you really believe that we are stupid? A few colorful pictures and cute animals and the story we do not care? HaHaHa you are no credible critic anymore :-) Find a new job, we will not look at you anymore if we want to know something about a movie. Disney paid you and then exposed you, bad luckLook at one, TFA after 2 years 842 pages reviews 88% audience reviews, TLJ after 3 months 2120 pages at 48% (with correct count of zero and half stars about 25%), something is wrong with the MOVIE :-) ))Here two 5 star reviews behind each other, one with name one without name, please do not say that's coincidence!!!joao vMarch 3, 2018(2∫C) star wars is a very good movie, has a good interpretation and has incredible historyMarch 3, 2018(2¬∫C) star wars is very good movie, has a good interpretation and has incredible story.Disney paid 5 stars one-liners, and now they are almost the same, the writers will not remember anything about this Star Wars Horror Movie :-)Critics who are looking forward to part 9, you can choose the chairs in the cinema, you will have plenty of space :-))Some 5 star reviewers write, the film has implemented 1.3 billion, he must be good?1: If we had known beforehand what would have happened, the movie would not have made a billion.2: TFA made over 2 billion, small difference - right? TLJ can not do that anymore.3: Now that we know what's coming of bad writing - solo / SW9 certainly not that high, except for Ron Howard / JJ making extraordinary movies with a wonderful story, such as Rogue One, that's saying now.Let's see Disney have bet on the right horse. The only thing that matters is - Money - let's see who has more, your new audience or us - Premiere Star Wars 1977 - Fans who do not want to see Star Wars 9 :-)Of course TFA is based on ANH and TLJ on TESB / ROTJ. Yoda was a lonely recluse / Luke is a lonely recluse. The hero travels to master Rey / Luke - Luke / Yoda, his friends fight elsewhere Saltplanet / Endor. The hero must cancel the teaching mission to save his friends. Hollywood and the studios have been making bad story writing for years - look to the remakes / prequels and more. A handful of films are good, over 80% not! We have noticed this here in Germany for 15 years, you in filmmaker country not?I just wanted to tell a good story, whether the main role of a woman or an actor from any country, I do not care. I have not written a review on Star Wars since 1977. But now it had to be, TLJ has great pictures, but nothing else ...So, there is much else, but I do not feel like it anymore ....This - new way - of Star Wars will NOT be mine ....Disney = no more money from me !!! I know Disney, that hurts you the most :-))This is not my Luke, Han shot first and only, Chewbacca eats porgs, Jedi needs training more than 10 minutes... and and and....Greetings from Germany, may the force be with us - except the makers of this film..."

"637",0.5,"  After a long wait, what a disappointment this movie is. Story feels rushed with many plot-holes and continuity problems from TFA.It looks and sounds like a Star wars movie with its cutting edge visuals, amazing sound-fx and gorgeous music score by John Williams. But it feels empty, with no character development, it lacks any kind of emotional content. I couldn't care less about any of the new characters now, which is a shame because they had so much potential after TFA.I loved both TFA and Rogue-one, but I just cannot accept TLJ. It feels like a cheap generic sci-fi movie in a flashy Star wars wrapper. I sincerely hope the Star wars brand can recover, but the last jedi was a big let down for me and left me very unhappy and disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie."
"638",5,"  I had to see it twice. The first time I gave it a solid 7.5. But the second time i saw it I gave it a 9.5. The issues I had the first time were gone. I loved every second of it. The story was amazing, the action, and I cant wait for whats next."
"639",2.5,"  bom filme mas um pessimo star wars"
"640",0.5,"  Nothing I can say isn't been covered by other fan of the original trilogy. Despite the visual. The story , the acting, the casting ,the narrative element made no sense whatsoever in this mess. ""Critics"" are calling it a good movie, I personally think they are bought up by Disney to save their asset.because money"
"641",4.5,"  As the war between General Leia's (Carrie Fisher) Resistance and Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) First Order esculates to new heights, Rey (Daisy Ridley) must now attempt to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the last Jedi Knight, to leave his self-imposed exile behind and rejoin the battle against evil...For the last two years, starting with the release of 2015's The Force Awakens, the combined efforts of Lucasfilm and Disney have managed to bring George Lucas's galaxy far far away, towards exciting new directions and opportunities with that film in spite of J.J. Abrams's tendency to reuse elements from the original trilogy throughout that film. The second film in the sequel trilogy, The Last Jedi, thankfully ditches this approach to storytelling in it's writing, although not in the way that one would expect based on what the marketing campaign suggests.Despite the presence of the infamous bird-like alien ""Porgs"" and having funnier banter than usual in a Star Wars film, it doesn't change the fact that The Last Jedi is possibly the most brutal and bleak film in the franchise since Revenge of the Sith. Rian Johnson isn't afraid of depicting the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order as a much more desperate and brutal conflict as shown in scenes in which quite a few known characters get axed off in seconds and the consequences of war, as shown in the sub-plot of Poe Dameron's (Oscar Issac) conflict with Leia's trusted Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), gets much greater focus than before. A far-cry from the serial-inspired battles of the original films, to be sure.Mark Hamill, after only getting a small cameo in the last film, steals the show as a grumpier, embittered Luke while the recently departed Carrie Fisher gives an excellent final performance as Leia, although given the circumstances of her death, some of her scenes can be quite upsetting to watch. Although both John Boyega and newcomer Kelly Marie Tran have excellent chemistry between each other and the previously mentioned Oscar Issac finally gets to flesh out his character a lot more, both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren don't seem to be as committed as last time though as a lot of thier scenes drag on for ages.Overall, despite having some incredibly odd moments and some unsatisfactory pay-offs, The Last Jedi is a wonderful film to celebrate not only the 40th birthday of the film that launched the Modern Age of cinema, but also to remember why we loved these films in the first place. With the tragic passing of Carrie, Kenny Baker and numourous other figures in the franchise over the last two years, the most important thing to remember is that, to quote Master Yoda himself, it's important to ""pass on, all that you've learned"" and keep moving forward without relying too much on the past and judging by the overall message of this film, it couldn't be more true than ever."
"642",2,"  Since when was Star Wars a comedy? This missed the mark by at least 12 parsecs. Would have been nice to take some queues from Rogue One."
"643",0.5,"  The movie is basically a pinnacle of Kathleen Kennedy's crusade towards pushing bigotrous agenda. The setup the Episode VII has been ignored giving Rian Johnson unlimited power as to commit a rape of Star Wars universe. If you enjoyed the Original Trilogy, respect, love and relate to its characters, stay away from this atrocity of a movie.The plot and character development are a lame jape and never have I seen so much identity politics shoved in cinematic experience just to pander to certain demographics in an attempt to maximize profits. I rejoice in seeing the agenda and approach introduced by the current Lucasfilm president fails. Doubling down or even tripplilng down on her agenda will lead Star Wars further towards 6 feet underground. I will neither acknowledge, nor forgive Kahleen Kennedy for calling shots as to killing off one the best Star Wars charcters (spolier alert, this character's name rhymes with Johnny Walker).Absolutely disgracefull and self-righteous of current Lucasfilm leadership to stand for this film, not acknowledge obvious mistakes and ideological overtone they are so desperately trying to push."

"650",0.5,"  Star Wars the last Jedi is a beautiful well shot film with spectacular visuals and cgi compared to the other films. Thats the only thing that it has going for it. Star Wars the last Jedi didn't feel like a star wars movie. There are many plot holes in this film that I dont want to get into due to spoilers. The film tries to subvert our expectations but fails miserably. The last Jedi is a failure which is pretty funny considering that's the message of the film, failure is our greatest teacher. Well let's hope Disney learned from this one, which I doubt."

"654",1.5,"  The Force Awakens was okay, Rouge One was great, but the Last Jedi is just plain bad. All I ask for as a Star Wars fan is consistency within the universe. Why is Luke behaving out of character? Also keep your political messages out of Star Wars. I hate the feeling of being lectured by Hollywood, especially when it's done in a way that feels forced and try hard. Wish they'd get some old school hard core Star Wars fans to monitor production for quality control or something."

"658",1,"  SPOILER FILLED REVIEWFinally saw The Last Jedi and it's ok, but in no shape or form second best after TESB. What I liked most was the character development of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, very well build up as the main proponent of the dark side, no second Vader but he doesn't need to be, actually a much more complex and interesting character.The battle scenes were impressive and the movie looks and sounds beautiful.There's a few funny moments that work well, not the Porgs though, what do these anoying penguins in a star wars movie, they didn';t learn their lesson from Jar Jar Binks.Carrie Fisher was great, even though the space scene was utterly ridiculous. The reunion with Luke was very well handled even though he turned out to be a bloody hologram, jeez.I loved the reunion of Luke with Yoda, to me the most moving scene, quite magical.Ok, the gripes:- Luke was badly handled and I know it's a very subjective opinion, but on this topic it can't be anything else of course. I didn't want, what some fans seemed to be craving for, a reunion with Leia and Han and the old gang kicks ass one more time. That would have been stupid in my mind, but the way it eventually ended up being handled didn't feel right to me either.Of course the movie is about Luke/Rey (being the last Jedi) I excpected way more than the scenes they had together.Even though, if you think back, Luke's training by Yoda wasn't spend that much time on either, but somehow impacted you more, because Luke leaves, though before completing it, called away by the urge to save his friends. Rey leaves, because she has no time left to help her friends, but also because she is disappointed and failed by Luke, Big difference.Also a gripe that keeps resurfacing, the parallels with the original trilogy are becoming a bit annoying and to be honest, come accross as a bit lazy by the writers.Rey has become annoying and in no way captures your heart as Luke did in the original trilogy, sorry, she has a lot of spunk, but memorable she the character is not. Don't know why yet, but I think it's the writing not the actress.Still don't have a clue what Finn is good for in this story, baffles me how he keeps getting screentime even though the character is developing nowhere.Damon Poe has replaced him as the more fun rebel.Didn't like at all the send offs of two of the new villains Snoke as well as Captain Phasma, apart from the fact that nobody kicks Brienne of Tarth's ass, sorry Poe, they both deserved a way better ending, having been build up in part seven and then show them once and off they go?That;s crappy writing and no one will convince me otherwise and a shame because both had potential.Anyway, I am very glad there was a new Star Wars and well, since the old garde is now gone, I hope they will start truly taking the reigns of the franchise storywise and actually come up with someting new and not just a badly disguised rehash of the original trilogy."
"659",0.5,"  This was bad, I saw it in the theaters and have decided I will never see another Star Wars movie until the franchise is bought by someone new. I'm sad I'm late for a timely review to be perfectly honest. Maybe, just maybe I could've saved someone from viewing this terrible movie.Firstly Rey is a Mary Sue, insanely overpowered. Secondly Holdo makes her plan not apparent and causes a mutiny. Thirdly I simply hate how the whole destiny thing got torn apart and Luke was made into a sad, sorry character. I would go into more detail, but I'd rather not dig into this toxic sludge anymore."
"660",0.5,"  the only one good moment was when Yoda summoned the lightning and destroyed the Jedi temple or something. he should have broken the 4th wall and destroyed this franchise too. its a bad movie.bad ,bad movie."
"661",4,"  I don't know why everyone is complaining about this movie. Yes alittle confusing at some parts, kind of drags on. But still a very good movie."
"662",4,"  A fun addition to the galaxy. A bit hammy in some of the humor, and the plot could have used some work, seems stretched at times. But solid acting performances from all our heroes, and a basic storyline that works. Ignore the whiners, and watch and enjoy."
"663",4,"  Calm down Star Wars fans"
"664",4,"  I'm sure on rewatching I'll find things to nitpick, but it was a fun experience and I love the porgs."
"665",1.5,"  It was terrible. The set up made from 7 were over looked and thrown away. Character development was disgusting, and new ones are added left and right. The story liine is beond confusing, and everything that happenes during the whole movie all most means nothing. The movie, had it not been for the success of all the others, would have been given a 1/5 simply for the music. Just terrible."
"666",0.5,"  Luke should have had power like no other. Should have left in floating boulder scene. Carrie is gone Disney had 1 chance. Fire Kathleen Kennedy."
"667",0.5,"  Good sci fi movie. Terrible Star Wars movie."
"668",5,"  Really loved this movie and can't wait for Episode 8"
"669",0.5,"  great visuals and special effects, strong acting at times, weak story, bad story, poorly developed characters... truly disappointing."
"670",1.5,"  Such a disappointment. Liked force awakens and rogue one, but this BS with space not affecting people (bomb doors, leia, opening doors to blown away captains bridge) inconsistent. Worth seeing.... but don't count on loving it."
"671",5,"  Easily the best of the newer Star Wars movies. This one gives you something more in the best way. The Force Awakens was enjoyable as well but purely runs on nostalgic value. However, this installment is much more fleshed out and contains more captivating scenes that will have you further invested in the new characters just as much as the classic ones."
"672",2.5,"  Very much a mixed bag, with all the now-normal star wars plot holes and illogical battle dynamics, but very nice visuals and traditional score make it enjoyable."
"673",2,"  A shitty movie that disrespected the actors, fans and director of the old franchise"
"674",2,"  Didn't work for me. The acting came off as horrible. Lena Dunham (who I like in many things) seemed so miscast and Fischer and Hamill (both, interesting people but not the best actors) were pretty bad as well. It felt like the whole thing was filmed in front of a green screen with the actors trying way to hard to make something out of nothing."
"675",1,"  Easily the worst Star Wars movie. The only good things about it is the acting, Not the characters, but the acting, the visuals, and the music."
"676",0.5,"  Who wrote and directed this piece of trash, To hell with Disney"
"677",2,"  Had good special/sound effects but that's about it just didn't really feel like a Star Wars movie to me anymore. If you want to know the reasons why I'd highly suggest you watch the review from E;R about the last jedi since my points pretty much are the same like his (aka the plot holes Ray being a mary sue)"

"685",4.5,"  This is without a doubt the most controversial star wars movie ever. Plenty love it, but far more seem to hate it, and honestly, I couldn't tell you why. Last jedi is a fantastic movie that was more than worth the 2 year wait."
"686",3.5,"  OK Writing: 1 StarNo character development, cheesy dialog, splintered plot and lack of understanding of source material. IF only they spent more money on writing!!Superb Production: 2.5 StarsCinematography, soundtrack, costumes, special effects and set design are all wonderful! What you would expect from a disney starwars budget!"
"687",4.5,"  Thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of times where you think you know where it's going and it surprises you with a changeup. Has the typical time/space realism problems of other Star Wars movies, but that's a minor concern. Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren are in particularly fine form throughout and strong character development is focused on Poe Dameron - not bad for a character who wasn't originally going to survive the first movie."
"688",5,"  Personally I loved it"
"689",1,"  literally garabage... I'm so disappointed. I don't know what's worse...the prequels or this Disney adaptation. To all of you who loved this travesty. Good god...are you even human?"
"690",3.5,"  It has flaws, but the overall the positive is overweighing"
"691",4.5,"  There were some ""wtf"" moments. I didnt really like how they portrayed Luke. But it was a good movie!"
"692",2.5,"  Better than the last one, but not great like the John Lucas directed films."
"693",0.5,"  Worst star wars movie. i'm not goiNG TO SEE ANY STAR WARS MOVIE EVER AGAIN."
"694",0.5,"  A very badly written movie with no cohesion with previous films it is intentionally rewriting the way the in universe powers work in order to make rey as strong as possible. the CGI was very noticeable and did little to hid that they used it for the fight scenes and actors that were dead."
"695",2,"  ""This isn't going to go the way you think"". They warned us."
"696",0.5,"  By far, the worst Star Wars ever."
"697",0.5,"  Kathleen Kennedy and the director should be executed"
"698",0.5,"  Absolutely an atrocious use of the Star Wars Saga. Can't believe I paid money to see it."
"699",4.5,"  This was spectacular, I can't spoil it for anyone."
"700",2.5,"  When a movie is made the director has a first cut, then he cuts out all the stuff that does not move the plot forward, or are just fluff and unnecessary. It's like he did that but then got confused because the movie was only 15 minutes long, so he just made a move from the deleted scenes.Almost everything that went on in this movie was pointless to the plot, which was The rebels are almost wiped out and need to survive, and escape."
"701",2,"  The movie is about an hour too long which makes the payoff not worth it."
"702",3,"  Episode 8 is a mixed bag of good and bad, essentially it is two movie jammed together and flows just as well as that sentence implies. Abrams should have directed the entire new trilogy instead the new director ignored everything Abrams had built up and wasted several promising characters and plotlines in the process.The Luke, Rey, Ren section of the movie was good but The Canto Bight sequence was very reminiscent of episode one; too much CGI, pointless characters, and sideplots that went nowhere.While the franchise is not dead per se, it is badly wounded. If they had cut out the Canto bight sequence and eliminated the Poe mutiny sideplot then this would've been a much better movie and at 2 1/2 hours a much shorter movie."
"703",1.5,"  I liked Ep7... First time, i come from cinema, already i liked this Ep too, but with a large criticism around i come to see again it, and look close to story, characters, and compare it to all other films and stories... Its disaster, yea, its fun, its comedy, but its all. Enjoy is not all for Star Wars, its about character progression, a huge villains and heroes, about drama even a comedy, about story and nice endings... Ryan Johnson kill SW by a simple joy from film, and if you dont see it, turn every episodes again on your screen..."
"704",2,"  Not good. Visually wonderful and DRIVER gives a great performance but other than that? The movie doesn't really work. And the casino subplot is pointless I get what their trying to articulate but it made the movie 40 minutes longer for NO reason. Poe's plot is nonsensical as well. This film has good moments but that's all they are; moments. ""SALT?!?"" That was the stupidest moment I've seen in a main stream film in a LONG time"
"705",0.5,"  worst acting ever, it was really truelly like watching spaceballs, I used to love the star wars franchise so so so so much but I wont be paying to see any of this silly b rate offence to George lucas crap ever"
"706",0.5,"  This film ruined Lukes character and the story was unconsistent with force awakens. Ray's parents revelation was a huge upset to what it could of been and the casino scene was a waste of time. Lots of unexplained plot between the films and for the most part a lot of second thinking and twisting to the plot mid movie. Ryan Johnson wanted to try something new by dodging and weaving past every possible exspectation a longtime fan could of had thought up with that could of made any scene better to give us this dissapointment. Even skimming some of the theory forums could of given him an idea to what fans were anticipating and gone off it. Ray being a grand palpatine? Thus explaining her strong force powers and rapid skill, or snoke being plagaus? Giving that character far more meaning and significance and having luke duel him in a most epic showdown never before seen in star wars history, we are talking crators forming, ground cracking, planet evecuating level intensity. He instead made everything ""a twist"" and thus ruining the movie. Next time he should listen to the fans, if he gets a next time."
"707",2,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an insult to the series worse than the prequel trilogy. Just like its predecessor, it focuses on ""reimagining"" the story of the original, but does so in a worst way possible. The Last Jedi contains some of the most moronic scenes in the filming industry I've ever experienced. The way this Star Wars installment treats some of its characters is absolutely incomprehensible to me. How can you take such an iconic, relatable and badass character of all times and turn him into what you see in this movie - a failure? Explain that to me, if you can. Other characters are complete blank now. They have no motivation, no interesting stories to tell, and the worst offender is that they have no purpose to exist in this universe other then to create our so beloved forced diversity. Replace everyone in this film with only white male cast of movie veterans and nothing would change. They'd still be boring, moronic and have nothing to give, but at least there'd be some good performance. Not to say that the cast doesn't know, what they are doing, but they have absolutely nothing to work with. I guess that the writers were given a task like:""PC, feminist and SJW bs first; logic, sense and general storytelling are not important"". Why? Why would you do that? Star Wars was never about that, it was about adventure! And let me tell you, this smoking garbage hardly qualifies as one. It will take for a one hell of a ride. A ride, full of idiots, moronic situations and stupid ways of getting out of them, and most importantly... forced romance. Good god."
"708",5,"  After Blade runner 2049, this is just another proof, why hollywood needs to take chances and not make films only to show action, but to tell beautiful stories with unique visions, that only true film lovers will understand!"
"709",0.5,"  Abysmal. This movie is what happens if you have a director that hates all the elements that made Star Wars great (campy heroism, good storytelling, and consistent set of themes to name a few). This is like an 2.5 hour commercial for PETA to the point where I have to know if they actually paid the director. Also really glad they brought in a nihilist codebreaker into the same movie that looks like it was designed to sell stuffed animals to kids to talk about the nuances of arms dealing. Thank you for ruining Poe's character by the way. This movie isn't just bad. It's Rian Johnson giving the middle finger to Lucas in not so subtle ways. Oh you were excited to figure out what the story is with the Jedi sacred texts? Fuck you lol let's have Yodi appear and light them all on fire and say they were boring. Like that's actually what he says. Oh you wanted to see how wise Luke has become and what plot he has cooked up and what he's been doing. Well the most powerful Jedi in the universe tried to kill his disciple for having bad thoughts and now fishes and drinks space cow milk. And oh you wanted to see how Snoke would be as a real villain (seeing how Rey has already beaten Kylo) ? Nope let's make him do a half baked return of the Jedi sidious impersonation and them become completely irrelevant."

"712",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is a Disgrace to Every Star Wars Film That Came Before It. Also, an idiot could've told a better story than this pathetic try. Are yoy kidding me?"
"713",3.5,"  Overall it's not a perfect film but it's not a bad one either. If you can let go of some of its more dumb moments, it's very enjoyable and it's a very fun film. Kylo is an interesting character and I like the direction of the characters and Luke's character didn't feel too far fetched from his orginal character.The main themes they focus on like failure and sacrifice were interesting. The story itself wasn't good or bad but I enjoyed all the scenes involving luke and rey. The movie left me asking a lot of questions but it didn't ruin the movie for me or ruin star wars in general."

"715",1.5,"  Came in with enjoyment (not expecting very much but) and left with confusion and doubt"
"716",0.5,"  Spoilers - Mastering the Force no longer requires training, Finn is no longer a main protagonist and he repeats the same arc from the previous movie in a plot line that doesn't affect the rest of the movie, the main plot makes no sense (Holdo's plan is to hope the FO doesn't look slightly to the right of the ship they are tracking), and they destroyed the only characters that make 9 worth looking forward to."
"717",0.5,"  Lot of fake reviews on this movie. It was very disappointing and did not feel like star wars at all. Nothing about it was authentic to the originals, and the story just like the previous one is just a bad copy of the originals.This movie owes George Lucas an apology"
"718",3.5,"  Excellent effects, acting and casting as usual, but surprisingly weak story full of holes."
"719",1,"  This movie is a tragedy and is a last blow to a beloved universe. Who would have thought that this movie would be the death star to the franchise."
"720",2,"  The movie started off pretty good. The visual affects are nothing less than stellar.However, the story itself leaped off a cliff quickly. The bottom line... I watched it once, I was able to get through it easily enough (not like the prequels where I had to stop watching for fear of losing IQ), but I will most likely never watch it again... sad to say."
"721",1,"  I'm not a major Star Wars fan. I came into this movie with some knowledge on the universe but not enough for me to care about continuity errors or many of the characters. Even then, this movie was not only a bore to sit through, given that the story could have been told in 50 minutes, but it offers nothing that other Star Wars movies don't already do. Many of the characters are incompetent and one-dimensional, the special effects, for the most part, aren't anything snazzy and border on bad, and the story is so padded you'll be glancing at your watch wondering when the movie will be over. At least ""that one scene"" (avoiding spoilers but everyone should know it) with Admiral Holdo is gorgeous. It's a filler movie, and a bad one at that. Can't believe critics rated this so high, don't know what they saw that I didn't."
"722",1,"  I have never seen a director that so vehemently hates his source material."
"723",1,"  the way this film was written made it seem like Disney and rian johnson were rebooting the triology yet again by discarding elements pivotal to the force awakens. on top of that there were glaring omissions and flawed logic that killed any momentum the film had. if you are not concerned over logical story telling and just want to see a feel good, cliche, cheesy film that is lazily written, this one is for you."
"724",5,"  Rian Johnson achieves the feat of bringing us the fantastic Star Wars actions scenes we all love as well as establishing a meaningful and intelligent intellectual conflict within our main characters. The high points of this movie were fantastic, as we were able to see some incredible fight scenes-- both in space and on the ground-- as well as settling down for a few moments to go into a character's psyche. Johnson did a great job of showing the audience how each character's thought process works, and takes us away from the hi-tech flashiness to show us some raw emotions. Although the movie had some fantastic moments, it heavily lacked in other areas. These lacking areas most prominently stem from filler scenes/filler characters. These were evidently placed in the movie simply to add on a third story as well as give some more action. While this will satisfy young members of the audience, it is quite disappointing if you're like to watch a consistently interesting and engaging movie. The low points of this film really took me out of it for the entire scene, but I quickly reentered as the plot got back on track.In the end, it's a Star Wars film! They're always fantastic and I applaud Rian Johnson's courageous take on the story. While the movie has its flaws, its overall story telling and engagement was fantastic."
"725",0.5,"  Garbage. Milking the space moose. Have Rey get called by darkness to find nothing. If this was a marketing stunt. Why destroy the only cool costume.?Kylo ren became the worst villain. I killed my dad but I can't kill my mom... he's yelling at rey ""let the past die, kill it if you have to. Yet he can't pull the trigger.  nothing went right with Leia.I always thought the whole map to find luke was stupid. This verified it. BB8 became the most powerful jedi. 13 year old pilot ""bombs away"" was patheticDIALOGUE IS THE MOST PATHETIC PART OF THIS MOVIE"
"726",2,"  Good action, deviated from the main plot and theme realities of the series. Tried to make social impacts and ended up making it even worse. Poor execution. Poor planning. Great effects."

"729",0.5,"  93% you have got to be f*cking kidding me!!!! it was LAME."
"730",3,"  2nd viewing significantly more enjoyable, I guess because the dissappointing bits were easier to ignore, still too long though and boring in parts, and still still difficult to enjoy any of the finn rose phasma plot line"
"731",0.5,"  SW is dead. VII set up some great story lines, and VIII just killed every one of them. Rian Johnson is now the most hated person on the planet - oh yeah and that galaxy far, far away."
"732",4,"  The Last Jedi is without a doubt, the boldest entry in the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson's new direction for the series is risky and subverts audience expectations. Unfortunately, this film is unexpected in a way that feels similar to ordering a pizza, opening the box, and realizing that they forgot the toppings.This film succeeds with its direction, acting, cinematography, special effects, production design, and choreography. But where this film fails is in the script. The most important thing in the Star Wars universe is the characters and instead of developing the characters, this film decides to strip them down for a purpose I hope I begin to understand by the time the next chapter rolls around. You really have to admire Johnson for attempting to turn this saga on its head, but when you walk this thin of a tightrope, you must be careful to maintain your balance. This film is a tonal and structural mess that convolutes the story of this trilogy and opens up several major plot holes that are hopefully addressed as the saga continues."
"733",2,"  I was squirming in my seat waiting for it to end. So many moments that made me ask the question, ""Why are they going down this path?"""
"734",2,"  May Contain Spoilers: With the story they had to work with, I would rather have spent 6 hours with Jar Jar Binks then watch this film again. Even if they overdid the CGI, and the charisma between Anakin Skywalker and Padme was terrible on Episodes 1-3, the rest of the acting was better and the story was solid.I always preferred Episode 4, 'A New Hope', because it stood on its own. Everything else is a sequel or a prequel.Even Rogue One was superior to this muddled mess. They should have made this one before Episodes 7 and 8.Now we have a wondering repetitious story line, poor editing, a budget that did not allow any retakes, a few cute but fakey puppets, a number of locations that were underused, AND original cast members that looked like they had Alzheimer's, with dull eyes and speech impediments.A sophomoric attempt at sci-fi.Notice how much lower the audience score was compared to the critics?Let me help with the story: Yoda is Darth Vader's father or grandfather. Luke is starting to look like Yoda. Rey is Kylo Ren's twin sister or his daughter sent back in time.And Darth Vader is their love child.Interesting how Star Trek keeps getting better and Star Wars just gets worse."
"735",1.5,"  I'd love to go into detail and explain the one and a half stars but I've decided that this Star Wars installment isn't going to take up any more of my time."

"743",0.5,"  Absolutely the worst movie of the year! so many plot holes and dumb moments i cant believe this is a SW movie. And what he did to lukes character is unforgivable. what a way to kill all interest in the next movie. A lifelong SW fan heartbroken."
"744",5,"  Good movie that gets a lot of flack for being too different from the previous movies. The opposite was said of the previous movie ""It wasn't different enough!"". Some people will just never be happy. I enjoy the flow of learning about new abilities not explored via the movies. I enjoy the fact that there are force user in Kylo and Snoke that are not Sith, but use the emotion and hate to wield the force. I also like that Rey appears to be heading down a path that might be seen as a Grey Jedi, where emotion and a sense of right intertwine to a point that there is a balance of the force within her. She has feeling and emotions that she allows to shape her decisions, but also has the central idea of the Jedi path to be of service and assistance to those in need.All in all a good movie that I'll enjoy watching over and over again."
"745",4,"  I'll get right into it, I loved the Last Jedi. As a big sci-fi fan, I am a sucker for a good space battle, and I am happy to report that the Last Jedi has some of the best space battles I have seen. Now I do admit that Rogue One's final space battle may be the best in Star Wars history, the CGI was so good it felt like actual ships, these space battle are definitely a very close second. From the maneuvers performed by Poe when he banks a sharp left to get behind the tie fights chasing him, to the resistance ship sacrificing itself by ripping the First Orders vessel using a Hyperspace Jump. These things were fresh and very welcome.The characters were also great in this movie. The stand out of course is Luke Skywalker. Controversially I never understood his significance in the original trilogy. This movie helps flesh out who he was and his place within the Star Wars Universe. It shows a deeper side to him, a man who has lived a life he didn't expect, or even wanted. He is burdened by the actions of his past, by trying to kill Kylo Ren in a moment of weakness, he feels responsible for the current state of the galaxy. His final fight with Kylo Ren of the salt planet was great. I had noticed he had his return of the Jedi hair and clothes and felt that this was Luke that people remembered. When Kylo orders the First order to fire everything at him, you felt the angry and betrayal he had towards to Luke, and it was great to see Luke playing off that. When it was revealed that Luke had actually only projected himself to the planet and not actually left the Jedi temple, I was a bit taken aback. It was a twist I did not see coming and, for me anyway, it was nice to see the force used in a different way that just moving things across a room. I accepted because the idea of force ghosts has existed in the Star Wars universe since a new hope, so Force projection is something I can get behind. Speaking of Force Ghosts, YODA!! Whenever Yoda showed up to help Luke deal with his issues, I totally fanboyed. It was the Yoda from the original trilogy, whacky and helpful. That was a twist I was not expecting. The other twist I did not expect was Luke's death, the power required to project himself was obviously too much for him and he died on the island after saving everyone from the first order. It was a fitting goodbye to the character, as I've said, force ghosts could allow for his return.The other characters were great in the movie, Ray was developed even further after force awakens. I felt she kind of tread water in the force awakens until the final fight so it was nice seeing her arc throughout the whole movie. While I never expected her to join the dark side as the trailers having us believe, I felt during the movie that it was at least a possibility. Her force connections with Kylo felt personal to both of them and added a depth to each character that I also really enjoyed. The conversation between them when they are talking about Rays nothing junky parents felt intimate and personal. I also really enjoyed Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. He feels like a troubled soul and the conflict he faces every day is shown to great affect and it makes you feel for the character. He is not just a bad guy, he is conflicted by his family lines, by who he wants to be and who people think he should be. Carrie fisher was also very good in this, it will be interesting to see how they deal with her passing after this movie because she is still alive at the end of it. Poe, Finn and the other characters were good as well, nothing stand out but definitely not badNow while there was a lot to love in this movie, there were some things that I did have problems with, the sub-story of Finn and new comer rose trying to find the code breaker felt completely out of place. We had Ray and Luke discussing the Jedi order and if he needed to exist, and we had Poe and Leia taking about the fate of the resistance, and then we had Finn and rose in a flashy casino world riding big horse dog creature. I know that they were there to try and save the resistance, but to me it just didn't fit.Another problem I had was with was Snoke. He was portrayed as this all knowing, all powerful force user. Yet we didn't didn't really see this, other than his ability to connect Ray and Kylo using the force. We also didn't learn much about him before he was ultimately killed by Kylo. I did like how is death was done, but I felt it was a bit of plot point more than a deserved death. If he was all knowing and all powerful surely he would have known that Kylo was using the force on the Light saber beside him and not just the One Kylo was holding.The first Order definitely did not feel as threatening as they should have in this movie either. General Hux felt more of a joke than a leader, and Phasma was again under used. The showed off new First orders weapons like the Dreadnought ship and the battering ram gun but these all felt 1 dimensional and just there to move the story on. Other than a couple of moments the only thing the First order did was follow a ship for 2 hours and shoot at it.VERDICT: INPATIENT CAREThere were definitely some iffy moments in the Last Jedi; I didn't really need to see Luke milk a weird creature udder for blue milk, but overall I think it was a great addition to the Star Wars Universe. It moved the Star Wars Lore along nicely while introducing aspects of existing canon that I felt had turned a bit stale. The characters felt real and their stories felt earned. I am very much looking forward to how this trilogy is brought to an end in the final chapter.David"
"746",5,"  I bought Star Wars The Last Jedi was a great movie especially the lackluster performance of the force awakens which one could argue was a rehash of A New Hope with a little bit of Empire Strikes Back thrown in. The Last Jedi while not perfect is a much better movie than people are giving it credit for. I highly suggest going and checking it out."
"747",0.5,"  This movie had a serious over-diversity problem. I hate where star wars is going."
"748",4.5,"  Not perfect but definitely the best Star Wars movies we've had in a long time."
"749",1,"  Star Wars: The plot armour awakens. Incredibly predictable and boring movie, filled with an overflow of characters that each held little to no meaning in my viewing. It seems as though anyone will enjoy a movie that reads ""Star Wars"" and features infamous lightsabers, no matter how garbage the content is."
"750",5,"  Great depth and, in my opinion, an entirely logical progression of the saga."
"751",1,"  Not really a Star Wars movie at all. So many plot holes, bad writing, bad plot that makes no sense, actions that make no sense and literally tbrows out every story line or concept for the past 40 years. Just a dumpster fire."
"752",1.5,"  Everything I was excited for that TFA set up was totally dismissed as if it didn't matter. 2 years of countless fan theories and speculation, all for nothing. In addition, the movie was extremely political which frustrated me to no end. And don't get me started on the ridiculous slapstick humor and bad jokes. I'm left wondering what they'll do for episode 9. There's no mystery, no plot momentum, nothing that leaves me wanting to find out what happens next. Truly disappointed."

"754",1,"  Disney, Johnson, JJ, and Kennedy did a great job completely going away from what Star Wars is actually about. They are killing the main characters in bogus ways because they want to create their own thing and make money. Luke would of never gone into hiding and Leia and Han would not of allowed him to do so either."
"755",1,"  This is too long to be considered good merchandise ad, and is too dumb to be considered good movie."
"756",1,"  Not sure how you watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and end up writing this piece of crap. They have one last shot a redeeming themselves, but I probably won't be going to the theatre to find out. The way Luke felt in this movie is the same way I feel about the new Star Whores movies."
"757",0.5,"  Terrible movie full of plot holes inadequacies and terrible. Acting."
"758",0.5,"  The last two Star Wars movies have ruined the franchise for me."
"759",0.5,"  A decent movie, but a total garbage star wars movie,"
"760",1.5,"  While visually and technically crafted at a high level, the plot was contrived, and new characters pushed forward at the expense of the older established characters. To quote Mark Hamill ""This is no my Luke, this is Jake Skywalker""... Also they ""Lucasarts"" was heavy handed with the inserted politics of the real world... SW is escapism, I don't need a refresher on the 1%, slave kids, or the plight of alien horses"
"761",0.5,"  This movie is a disgrace. It is not canon. Luke would not behave as he does in this movie. A slap in the face to true star wars fans everywhere."
"762",0.5,"  worst star wars film ever"
"763",1.5,"  Am about as certain as I can be that people who don't like this film have said it all for me. Plots that make no sense, boring characters with little development, the continuing Mary Sue phenomena of Rey, evil characters that are nowhere near as menacing as the originals, you name it. So disappointed with both this and the predictably bad JJ Abrams offering, I won't be going back to watch any more of them. Let's face it, if these new films weren't in the Star Wars universe and utilised the mythology and old characters of the originals, would they be any good? You know the answer deep down..."
"764",0.5,"  It's shallowly subversive and self-aware, mocking its predecessor to be ""Bold,"" while offering little in return. Simply stated, it's one large cringe."
"765",1.5,"  I cannot even begin to list the number of terrible choices made on this movie."
"766",0.5,"  Star wars Eisode 8: LUKE DIES"
"767",0.5,"  Simply put, don't go see this movie, don't watch it, don't buy it, don't give them your money. This was a horrible movie. I had hopes that they wouldn't screw it up, but they did. I left disappointed, I felt cheated and I didn't even want to watch Star Wars anymore, and I have loved this franchise since I was a kid. They completely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil was in his right to say that he fundamentally disagreed with everything they've decided to do with his character, because Luke is no longer a likable character). I had hoped to see a wise, old, and powerful Luke pulling of force abilities and saber combat that would've rivaled Yoda or Mace Windu. But, nope, they decided to make him a despicable character who barely uses the force, gives bad advice, refuses to teach Rey anything, and wants to rid the universe of the Jedi. The one cool battle scene with him ended up being a trick and he barely did anything (though the force ability he used was cool) then he dies for no apparent reason whatsoever. Rey is still good at everything with no training for nor reason and despite the fact that she is a nobody (yeah, another horrible surprise, her parents were basically the nobodies of nobodies). Her character doesn't progress at all, because she's already good at everything despite not knowing anything. Finn is still a main character for some reason and has a whole side story that turns out to be pointless and he probably should've died. Poe is a good character, until he is demoted and put in his place for no reason other than he didn't trust command because they're plan was stupid and purple hair lady didn't want to tell him anything. The asian girl who is introduced and made a main character for no reason is stupid and does nothing to the story other than give Finn a love interest and create completely unnecessary subplot. Adam Driver does a good job with Kylo, but the writers did a horrible job with the character. He is still unintimadating (I didn't think his character was anywhere near scary in 7 either, definitely not a new Vader) and is kind of stupid and changes emotions every scene. Snoke is shown to be super powerful in an awesome scene, until he is immediately killed by Kylo with a cheap trick that Sidious would've seen through easily. We learn nothing about Snoke so turns out he is another pointless character. Leia uses the force in a laughable scene that was supposed to be serious (apparently multiple theaters reported the audience burst out laughing) and probably should've been killed off. Phasma did nothing and was pointless (a common theme in this movie). Most of this movie would've been forgettable if it didn't piss me off so much because they ruined one of the greatest things ever produced. I'm pretty sure Rain Johnson heard that it was impossible to ruin Star Wars and make the new films worse than the prequels and decided to prove everyone wrong. I wish this movie (and probably The Force Awakens, though I liked that one more) should be wiped from canon and they should remake it. I don't want to watch any future Star Wars films after this one. I no longer plan on seeing Episode 9 or the Han Solo movie because I refuse to give money to these idiots who are ruing one of my favorite franchises of all time. DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY."
"768",3.5,"  This latest entry into the Star Wars cinematic universe is a love it or hate it kind of film. By that of course I mean there's moments and ideas you'll love as well as moments and ideas you'll absolutely hate. It definitely improves upon many of the aspects the Force Awakens lacked with a variety of settings and more engaging action sequences. With that in mind, it still proves to be more of a disappointment in killing off important characters needlessly like Admiral Ackbar and Snoke while introducing others that make you scratch your head as to why they're even there with the character of Rose managing to be more detestable than Jar Jar Binks. Furthermore, it features so many plot-holes and unnecessary story elements that it makes the film more frustrating in reflection than it should've been. Nonetheless, its amazing special effects, beautiful production design and heart-pumping score by John Williams save this film from its poor writing. Overall, it is a necessary though unsatisfying watch for the progression of Star Wars storyline."
"769",3,"  Pretty good overall, worst part is that the whole film takes place in one day"
"770",0.5,"  *Spoilers. Where to start with this piece of work? There were a lot of underdeveloped/pointless new characters and I would argue old characters (from pre-disney) didn't live up to their potential (Luke Skywalker, Leia). Some costumes (Such as Holdo's dress) didn't fit the scenes. A lot of hypocritical actions like Leia pushing responsibility for military deaths onto Poe for actions she had the authority and awareness to stop (when Poe led a successful assault to destroy a lethal threat) or when Rose stopped Finn from committing suicide to protect the resistance and then telling him that the only way to win is to protect the people he loves (which is what he was trying to do and almost did, Rose literally almost got the resistance killed). First Order are childish villains and would be lacking punch if it weren't for the resistance being just as incompetent (First Order are supposed to be a military, yet their general is literally toyed with in the opening scene by an idiot, like an idiot). Old characters are literally killed in the most lacklustre ways. Epic Rey training montage missing. Phasma exists, and then doesn't. Snoke exists, kind of reveals his grand plan, stops existing because Deus Ex Machina. To finish, CANTO BITE (Oh god why was this even recorded). This movie had large backing, talent, and still ended up in a state which leaves me deeply unsatisfied. It shows you the potential gold behind the could-be genius lazing on a couch. Not saying this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen, it's just not something I consider a good movie. 0.5/10 to balance the freaking critics giving this movie 5 stars (91%? Really...). I honestly think it's about a 2.5, or 3 tops."
"771",0.5,"  Luke never fights.. never.. never clashes light sabers ... i hate you starwars. We are over"
"772",0.5,"  I did not enjoy this movie at all, can't be called a Star wars movie.enjoyed the prequels more"
"773",2,"  A film with a lot of interesting moments but without any sort of cohesion and connection to each other, all put together for the sake of presenting itself as the 'subversive' and 'deconstructionalist' member of the franchise (which ultimately devalue these said moments; i.e. the lightsabre battles)."
"774",0.5,"  Completely destroys the storyline from the original trilogy and has no respect for the characters...this is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen"
"775",3,"  WOW, WHERE TO BEGIN? THE ACTION STARTS RIGHT AWAY AFTER THE TRADITIONAL EPIC OPENING CRAWL AND WE ARE LEFT OFF WHERE THE FORCE AWAKENS WAS AT THE END. THERE ARE MULTIPLE STORIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT IT ALL ENTWINES TOGETHER TOWARDS THE END. ADAM DRIVER'S CHARACTER KYLO REN A.K.A. BEN SOLO IS DRIVEN FURTHER OF ITS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S VERY AWESOME. DAISEY RIDLEY'S CHARACTER REY IS SOMEHOW A QUESTIONABLE DEVELOPMENT. I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD BE DEVELOPED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE SHE BECOMES PERFECT. JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL ABOUT THE FORCE, THIS MOVIE EXPLORES MORE ABOUT IT AND LIKE LUKE SAYS IN THE TRAILER: ""IT'S NOT GOING TO GO THE WAY YOU THINK!"" AND IT REALLY DOESN'T. THE UNEXPECTED PART THAT EVERYONE IS MENTIONING IN THE INTERVIEW VIDEOS IS NOT JUST ONE PART BUT MANY. THE HUGE PART IS MIDWAY INTO THE MOVIE. JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK AT ALL AND IT'S VERY, VERY SURPRISING. IN ALL MY YEARS OF WATCHING STAR WARS, THE LAST JEDI TOOK A TURN TO A PATH THAT NO ONE DARED TO TAKE BUT RIAN JOHNSON DID AND HE DID THIS IN A STRANGE WAY. I THINK EVERY STORY IN THE STAR WARS SAGA ARE UNIQUE, IN THEIR OWN WAY AND I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. YES, EVEN THE PREQUELS. BECAUSE I LOVE STAR WARS. SO VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, THE LAST JEDI IS BROUGHT DOWN IN THE RANKING OF MY TOP FAVORITE STAR WARS FILMS. THERE WERE A LOT OF FLAWS AND IT'S SURPRISING THAT THERE ARE A LOT IN A STAR WARS MOVIE.THE MOMENTS IN ACH-TO PLANET, WHERE REY MEETS LUKE WHILE CHEWBACCA AND R2-D2 STAND BY AT THE MILLENNIUM FALCON ARE MY MOST FAVORITE MOMENTS FOR SURE BUT THERE WAS NO TRAINING WHATSOEVER. SO WE GET REY VENTURING INTO A CAVE TO FACE HER FEARS AND WHAT NOT LIKE LUKE DID IN DAGOBAH BUT NO REAL PHYSICAL TRAINING WITH THE LIGHTSABER. JUST FLAILING ON A CLIFFSIDE. BUT I GUESS THAT'S A THING NOW FOR LEARNING THE JEDI ARTS. THE LITTLE ALIEN BIRDS CALLED PORGS SPICED UP THOSE MOMENTS. MADE THE MOVIE A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING. THE THEME OF HOPE IS YET AGAIN EXPLORED AND IT'S A GOOD THING WE DIDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT SINCE STAR WARS DEBUTED IN 1977. BECAUSE OF COURSE, THE RESISTANCE (REBELLION IF YOU WILL) ARE BUILT ON HOPE. POE DAMERON SHOWS THE SPIRIT OF THAT THROUGHOUT THAT MOVIE. WHILE HE WAS ANNOYING ALONG THE WAY, LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THIS GUY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THE VERY THING HE'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR. WHICH IS HOPE. VICE ADMIRAL HOLDO, WHO IS PLAYED BY LAURA DERN DID A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE AND A VERY EPIC ONE, IF I SAY SO MYSELF. IT'S GREAT TO SEE AN ACTRESS FROM THE FIRST JURASSIC PARK MOVIE TO BE IN A STAR WARS MOVIE AND I LOVE EVERY MOMENT OF HER BEING ON SCREEN. HOWEVER HER DEMISE SEEMED UNNECESSARY. WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SHOOT THROUGH A FLEET OF THE FIRST ORDER. JOHN BOYEGA WHO PLAYS AS FINN AND KELLY MARIE TRAN WHO PLAYS AS ROSE TICO, THEIR CHEMISTRY TOGETHER ARE SO QUICK AND PRECISE THAT IT WAS INTERESTING FOR THE TWO OF THEM TO WORK TOGETHER. ROSE TICO'S CHARACTER CONTAINED SO MUCH SPIRIT THAT SHE MAKES ME WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH HER AND LET HER KNOW THAT SHE'S NOT ALONE. C-3PO WAS FUNNY AS USUAL AND HIS QUIRKY PERSONALITY MADE THE MOVIE FEEL STAR WARS AS USUAL. I LIKE THE PARTS WHERE HE INTERACTS WITH POE DAMERON THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE.THERE IS TWO MORE THINGS I LIKE TO POINT BEFORE I WRAP UP THIS REVIEW OF SUCH A STRANGE YET INTERESTING MOVIE: LUKE SKYWALKER AND PRINCESS LEIA. CARRIE FISHER, NO DOUBT DID A PERFORMANCE THAT WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN AND WITNESSING HER DO THE STUFF WE NEVER SEEN BEFORE WAS PRETTY COOL. ALTHOUGH HER SCENE IN SPACE AND USING THE FORCE TO FLY IN BACK TO THE SHIP IS ANOTHER QUESTIONABLE SCENE. BUT I WILL MISS HER SO MUCH AND SHE IS FOREVER THE PRINCESS OF STAR WARS. BECAUSE TO ME, SHE'S ROYALTY.AS FOR LUKE SKYWALKER. WOW, JUST WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW. INFINITE TIMES WOW. MARK HAMILL SHOWS US A SIDE THAT OTHERS HAVE NEVER SEEN BUT FOR ME THAT'S ALREADY BEEN FAMILIAR. THE WAY I ENVISION LUKE AFTER RETURN OF THE JEDI. WHERE HE BECOMES A JEDI MASTER AND BECOMES MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. HE HAS SHOWN ME MORE ABOUT THE FORCE THAN I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE OR EVEN BE OFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE. BECAUSE THEY WERE ONLY SEEN IN VIDEO GAMES, COMICS, AND NOVELS. LUKE SKYWALKER IS ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITE JEDI CHARACTERS AND HE RANKS SECOND FOR ME AND HE STILL IS. HOWEVER HIS DEMISE SCENE WAS ALSO QUESTIONABLE. I COULDN'T REMEMBER IF ACH-TO HAD TWO SUNS. EVEN AFTER A NUMBER OF TIMES I WATCH THIS WEIRD AND FLAWED MOVIE. HOWEVER, THIS MOVIE ALSO GIVES A SEND-OFF FROM CLASSIC CHARACTERS WE LOVE. SO WITHOUT A DOUBT, HIS DEMISE SCENE IS STILL GOOD ANYWAYS.STAR WARS EPISODE VIII: THE LAST JEDI IS A FAST AND THRILLING ROLLER COASTER RIDE AND IT'LL PUT YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT UNTIL THE VERY END AND I MEAN THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FLAWS IN THIS THAT I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHY OR WHAT. ALTHOUGH I DID ENJOY IT, IT IS NOT THE BEST IN THE STAR WARS SAGA."
"776",0.5,"  I am without words to describe the sadness feel inside"
"777",2.5,"  From a critic point of view, I'm surprised they rated this movie so high. TFA was not a good star wars saga movie but at least they made it well with less jokes, ok new characters and tone. This movie however was edited poorly, shot amazingly, but with no good plot and a subverting expectation chaotic 2 hours which didn't work out well for the story. Characters didn't develop, Rey became a mary sue, Finn did nothing special and from a star wars fan i would say this disrespects the saga and franchise so much.It was made better then TPM and AOTC but it's the worst star wars movie. bad jokes, bad tone, bad story and script. Only good thing for it was the emotion, cinematography, special effects and models."
"778",5,"  The saga is excellent. Alot of the fanbase is""nt xd Others hating the prequels. Calling 7 a remake.Then this movie comes out and is the only saga problem?There lack of knowledges in people blaming disney. TheyHad since 2012 to know that Lucasfilm makes the moviesWhile disney did a solid thing on allowing the main company make theFilms. There a re dumb people alot"
"779",4,"  Im skeptycal my conclussion is?? sws a solid saga with a train wreck fanbaseFor alot of the part sorry no offense"
"780",4,"  It was a great movie it ranks up there with empire strikes back."
"781",1,"  I will never pay to watch ANY Rian Johnson directed Star Wars movies ever again and neither will any of my friends or family. Period."
"782",5,"  Why rate it a great 5? Because half of these reviews are butthurt fanboys stating that the movie was ""not what they had planned for"" in their fragile little heads. The movie on its own base was very fresh and original, giving some unique twists and removing a good amount of dead weight. Snoke is definitely a huge dead weight, a second-rate emperor that felt not only extremely CGI but also took lime light away from the good characters and events such as Kylo and the rebellion. Honestly, I don't like the hate this movie is getting from nothing less than fan-boy tantrums."
"783",0.5,"  What a disappointing movie! That really sucked! How in the world did the critics like that! The prequels get a ton of hate, but they are 10 times better than these last 2 piles of garbage."
"784",0.5,"  Awful and incomplete story, horrible directing, and a laughable dose of heavy handed feminism. They ruined this franchise."
"785",5,"  Stunning. And i will give my possitive score to give justice to the saga"
"786",1,"  Killed Luke Skywalker off. Never watch a Star Wars again by Disney"
"787",4,"  Not the typical Star Wars story-unexpected twists that took me by surprise but made subsequent viewing more enjoyable."
"788",3.5,"  Color red, Skywalker adventures coming to an end, many twists, new stories is what makes this a quality Star Wars movie"
"789",1,"  A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, a really shitty script, was executed in a really horrible way. This film just continues the creation of crap aimed at selling toys for a young generation, in an otherwise rich universe. Absolute garbage, with every imaginable cliche in the series, and some really dumb villains. The over-emphasis on emotional issues really kills me inside - it's just so bad. And the new characters? Annoying and forgettable. You get 1 star for the cool computer graphics as usual. Long story short, this movie feels like it was written by a child, for children."
"790",0.5,"  Ruined star wars with how they treated veteran characters"
"791",1.5,"  Over-budgeted and confusing fan fiction."
"792",0.5,"  The only thing that could make this movie worse would be Jar Jar Binks."
"793",5,"  This film completes Luke's journey over 30 years in the making and gives him one of the most interesting character arcs in movie history. We've seen him journey for innocent farm boy to cocky apprentice to Jedi warrior to bitter old man who decides he can still make a difference. One of the best films in the series next to The Empire Strikes Bakc and A New Hope."
"794",0.5,"  Worst mess of a Star Wars movie ever."
"795",2,"  Forget all the things you wanted it to be, things you wanted to happen in the story, things you wish didn't happen... all that aside... at it's core, TLJ is just poorly conceived disconnected mess of a story."
"796",5,"  The movie was awesome to put it shortly. I ending was great by living us with the possibility of younglings coming back. People who hate the movie never grew up loving the original films and like most young people today, they just wanted something to complain about."
"797",1.5,"  garbage all the way through."
"798",4.5,"  Hmmm...the only movie thus far i havent given 5 star to. I loved how the SW ladies take a huge step up, but, I feel like theses movies are starting to feel repititous and a hint hopeless for the heores. Visually stunning, cute animals, and still demands respect, The Last Jedi was good."
"799",5,"  Let the past die, kill it if you have to!This was not only the words that Kylo Ren spoke to Rey, but also the words of Rian Johnson to a generation of Star Wars fans. This is not like any previous film in the saga and for that, makes something old and familiar feel new and fresh again. Rian Johnson took risks and expanded on the mysticism of the force which was a huge gamble that paid off by clearing the slate for our new heros in Episode IX!Abrams has a difficult task ahead of him and doubt he will be able to eclipse the sheer brilliance of The Last Jedi!"
"800",3.5,"  Not the best star wars but still very good."
"801",0.5,"  the tomatometer reviews are rigged and paid off .."
"802",1,"  While this movie was good aesthetically from a story telling standpoint it was awful. The one star was for the visuals and the musical score. This movies fails for quite a few reasons:1. Characters act out of ""character."" Any half decent writer will tell you that when you write fiction that you need to know your characters intimately. Audiences can almost always tell when a character isn't behaving like they should. There runs rampant in the Last Jedi. It makes the movie unbelievable and insincere.2. Continuity. Its Evident that J.J. Abrams had direction he started this series on. Rian Johnson did not follow that road map. 3. In conjuntion with the first item Rian Johnson does not know how to write strong characters of any stripe or creed. He purposely weakend the established stronger characters like Luke and Leia so that newer characters can shine in their own right. He even weakened Poe and Fin. A story teller should never have to weaken any characters to make other characters stronger. They are not actually stronger...they only seem stronger.4. Rian Johnson basically burned the world to the ground. The Resistance is all but defeated and left without any strong leadership with the deaths of Akbaar, Leia, and Holdo. The whole of the Resistance fits in the Falcon. On the other side of things the First Order's back has been broken. Its largest assets have been destroyed(Supremacy/Star Killer Base) and Snoke has been killed. The First Order will be in a tough financial situation and it is leaderless. Neither Kylo Ren nor Hux is fit for leadership. From reading the novel most people in the First Order want to kill those two. It will eviscerate itself before too long.5. Building on the last item I really only see two ways of moving forward. the first and most practical reason is that it has to become 4 part series. the second option is to just redo the Last Jedi"

"808",0.5,"  watched this with my kids with great hope..... all hope is lost. I dont think dysney can come back from this. The story is dead saga ruined. Ah well better luck next time."
"809",1,"  The people giving this 4-5 stars need to be rounded up and frozen in carbonite so we don't have to read your idiotic reasons for defending this film. listing this as ""one of the best of franchise"" may actually fill me with more rage than the movie itself. YOU ARE NOT STAR WARS FANS."
"810",0.5,"  Made an account just to leave a review. Such a disappointing movie. It seemed good for a while, but the aggressive feminist, animal rights, and anti white male themes left a bad taste in my mouth. This movie has me considering going Disney-free until they clean up their act big time. Also, pretty weird how the tomatometer is so high (of 370 reviewers) when most of the audience out of 187,000 is saying the movie is garbage... Paid reviewers maybe?"
"811",0.5,"  If you've seen episode 5 you've seen episode 8."
"812",2.5,"  It's decent but one of least faves"
"813",2,"  I'm glad I didn't get caught up in the hysteria and pay good money to see this in theater. I now realize that the audience score is not the result of a fanboy sabotage. It really was forgettable, just like every middle entry in a trilogy. I'm far more interested in the side story movies than I am this trilogy. The hyperspace kamikaze scene was cool..."
"814",5,"  Melhor Filme da Minha Vida!"
"815",1,"  Social Justice Wars: The Lost Jedi was even worse than The Phantom Menace. At least that movie despite Jar Jar, pod racing, bad dialogue, and little Anakin held true to the overall vision and theme of the saga. This moving was an over hyped mess.Show your continued disgust and BOYCOTT SOLO.The official critics must have been paid to produce positive reviews. This movie is garbage.Tied for second worst Star Wars movie. He did what Jar Jar couldn't do which is to completely ruin the series. It was bad. There were a few good points in it though. Rey and Kylo were utilized well. The acting, overall was good. The character development of the primary characters was good, but the secondary characters, including Luke, were either mishandled or written poorly. Below are my top 10 problems with this movie. Warning, they contain spoilers/10. Force Skype9. Virtual lightsaber battle at the end.8. Psuedo pod racing scene with animal rights angle.7. Over-the-top feminist themes intensified.6. Continued hatred and exclusions of white males in the cast, unless cast as evil.5. Snoke was a strong, strong character. Why kill him off so easily?4. Only 3 lessons of Jedi training?3. Porg.2. The movie started off as a comedy. The jokes were funny, but Star Wars is NOT a comedy.1. Leia survives being sucked out into space without a space suit on.It's not exactly as bad as the Phantom Menace, but it isn't much better. Probably on par with ATOC.Here are two additional problems with the movie.Snoke's origin and source of training/power never explained. How Luke dies."
"816",0.5,"  I loved the Force awakens & rogue one, but I hated the Last Jedi so much. It will be the first star wars movie that I will not be purchasing and may be the last one that I ever see in the theaters. took everything great from the other films and took a giant pile on it."
"817",2,"  Good visuals, but bad story."
"818",3.5,"  A Good plot ruined by unnecessary scenes , it can be made better by erasing some plot holes."
"819",1,"  This movie was an atrocity. It killed 40 years of the established canon by turning Luke Skywalker into something he would never, ever do. Vader : *Killed hundreds and even had a part in blowing up a planet*Luke : ""There is still good in him.""Kylo : *Has some bad dreams*Luke : ""Better murder him in his sleep?!""The rest of the movie is just as bad."
"820",0.5,"  I made an account just to downvote this movie. It killed my passion for the upcoming SW movies. If i could have given it less then half a star i would."
"821",2,"  Star Wars: The last jedi, is not a bad movie, but it is insulting. The visual effects first off are AMAZING! However, a movie can't function on beautiful effects alone. Once you get rid of these effects and are left with the story, you might be disappointed. If you're a casual viewer, and barely know or care about the star wars lore, THIS IS FOR YOU! However, if you are an actual fan of the franchise and it's lore, you can not watch this movie, and not be disappointed. Before I watched the movie, I saw a lot of far left extremist media talk about ""Alt right"" bombing the film on here. I had a lot of good hopes for the movie, but in the end, I know it's not ""Alt right"" bombing the movie, it's far left people who have no idea of what star wars is, praising it.The big cliffhanger from the previous movie goes right off the cliff ""litteraly"" , and the big question of ""who reys parents are"" will feel you dissatisfied and insulted. What they did to Lea was insulting to the bone. However, there were great moments which I won't discuss here because I don't want to spoil it, but they felt not enough. In conclusion, this is in my opinion the most insulting star wars movie, but if you think about it as ""not really canon"" you still can have a lot of fun with it."
"822",0.5,"  Total garbage. Don't spend a dime on this horrible movie,"
"823",1,"  Bland characters and immersion breaking logic problems throughout. Why bother making a massive dreadnought if it can be destroyed by 1 bomber?..why bother making a massive capital ship if it can be destroyed by a ship engaging it's light speed engines and ramming it?..why did the rebels not do this to the death star if it was possible?. Why if Luke did not want to be found...DID HE LEAVE A MAP DETAILING HOW TO FIND HIM?; this movie manages to be not only be nonsense but actually undermines the rest of the series."
"824",2,"  As a huge Star Wars fan I left the Cinema after watching this feeling really disappointed. The last Jedi basically threw out every story arc created by JJ Abrams in the force awakens. Who Reys parents are, Snoke, Knights of wren all thrown in the bin for whatever reason. It was all an up yours to JJ Abrams and his story from Force Awakens, making that film pointless. Every turn this movie took I felt was a let down, trying to be different for different sake.The humour I found to be off, the film basically starts with a prank call ending in a Your Mother joke!The story is the slowest space chase in history where some random resistance leader appears instead of say Ackbar and takes over as leader while a main character is out of action, but instead of letting anyone know what her plan is, keeps it a secret for whatever reason. Making Poe the resistance hero look like a moron the whole movie as he questions what's going on, thinking a traitor is aboard.Finn was off on a pointless side quest with a new character where we can learn that animal cruelty is wrong, rich people are bad, oh and so is child slavery if you didn't know. Ending in a terrible escaping on back of animals cgi laden scene.Rey doesn't get taught anything from Luke which was such a let down. Luke was wasted badly in this film, this was not Luke we all knew from the original trilogy. Of course he would change over the years but not become what Rian Johnson created.The ending for the middle of a trilogy was bizzarre, focused on a random kid staring into the stars insinuating a new hope is born rather than focusing on the heroes of the story. It deffinately didn't have me excited about what is going to happen next in episode 9.Effects were good as you would expect and I found everyone acted well with what they had to work with. I would class this as the worst Star Wars movie so far. Because Im weak I will probably buy this on Blu Ray at some point because I'm a Star Wars nut, but I wont pre-order like I did say Rogue One which was a great Star Wars story. My negativity is coming from someone who read all the EU books before they were just legend, so my thoughts on how great the continued story could be were high, with Force Awakens not dissapointing. Unfortunately my expectations for future Star Wars has really nose dived.Rian Jonson really blew it with this one, Im not sure how JJ Abrams can pull this back for episode 9 unless he retcons multiple things from this movies story some how."
"825",0.5,"  I love Star wars but I fucking hate this movie"
"826",0.5,"  This is not Star Wars. I was apprehensive, yet hopeful when Disney bought Star Wars. I was concerned about how they would handle Luke's character. My greatest fear came true. The Last Jedi managed to not only destroy Luke's character, but it also managed to destroy the Star Wars saga and its future. I will continue to enjoy the original trilogy, but will never again watch a Disney Star Wars film or buy their products."
"827",0.5,"  Shockingly the worst star wars production ive ever seen. ruins the legacy that george lucas created. Not only do i not suggest it to anyone considering watching it in the future but I wish i had never seen it myself."
"828",1,"  Not happy with these Disney reboots. They are sub par, and lack the magic that Star Wars used to have. They got Luke's character all wrong. Lame."
"829",0.5,"  A complete mishap, a travesty. This isnt star wars."
"830",5,"  This is an amazing movie, I haven't been so consumed by a Star Wars film since I was 11 in 1977 and saw the first Star Wars. I love it."
"831",5,"  1.3 billion in earnings and I saw it seven times. Loved it."
"832",0.5,"  I guess I'm a bot. I don't review much, but I felt I needed to say I didn't like it. The movie urself wasn't the worst movie of the series, but at the end you're left with less you be excited about for the future than ever. There were scenes that may have been exciting, but for every one good scene, there were 2 bad ones. The reason posting this is because of a thought I had of why I didn't like it. Phantom menace was a worse movie, with less redeemable moments in the movie, but at the end, there was still stuff to look forward to like the eventual grown up Anikin Skywalker betraying the Jedi, obi wan, Yoda, mace windu, the Emporer's rise.... what you just saw was bad, but it'll lead to something good. Here, it's less bad, but I'm not looking forward to the future. I find the characters of Rey and Kylo to be bland. Finn is pointless, Poe is bad, Carrie Fisher is dead RIP.... there's nothing left. Kinda wish I never saw it too be honest."
"833",5,"  Completely unexpected and new, The Last Jedi takes Star Wars to places we've never seen before. I'm not just talking about actual locations but the tone and the ideas and the philosophy that happens in this film is beyond incredible. People will always hate good movies for reasons beyond normal people's comprehension, but this movie delivers where Star Wars has been lacking or never had in the first place. Complete masterpiece."
"834",5,"  Man oh man. So incredible. I'll start with what I didn't like: I didn't like the purple-haired lady, I didn't like the alien milk scene, I think they over did Poe's rebellious nature, and did Rose and Finn really have to save all the cute animals while all their friends were about to die? BUT NOW, THE GOOD STUFF: the soundtrack oh man I listen to it every day. The costumes: brilliant! designed beautifully! Rey's slightly changed attire is wonderful! Leia's clothing is striking, elegant, strong! Kylo Ren is dressed like a legend! The cinematic beauty of it all! There were scenes that quite literally took my breath away! I was in awe! A masterpiece! The over-arching themes!! Obi-Wan hesitated to fight Anakin even after he had watched him murder children, because he believed there was still good in him. Luke hesitated to kill Vader even after Vader tortured his sister Leia, crushed planets, & wasted hundreds of Jedi lives, because he believed there was still light in him. Rey did not kill Kylo Ren because she saw Ben Solo in him, because it is the Jedi way to hold out for light, and good, and trust in the Force. Excellent! Moving! Terrific!"
"835",0.5,"  Star Wars by Disney has become a great sci fi line of movies, but NOT good Star Wars movies. The fact that they have slap stick humor and even the little bit of language that this movie contained make it have more of a guardians of the galaxy feel than a classic star wars film."
"836",5,"  Great movie, very enjoyable, I really like how they set up the big ending in the first half of the film with dialogue subtext. It's one of those movies you don't quite understand all details at first, just like any Star Wars movie should be."
"837",0.5,"  oFFICIALLY RUINED STAR WARS."
"838",1,"  This is not Star Wars. This is a Disney piece of shit. Thank you Disney for successfully turning the Star Wars franchise into a new Transformers franchise. Filled with dumb, cringe worthy, pathetic, un-funny one liners. There are so many things going on with so many different characters, everyone is screaming for air time, and the small amount they are given is lack lustre. There is no continuation from The Force Awakens and the plot takes you on an illogical roller coaster ride, jumping from one scene to another, just to leave the last one hanging by a thread full of unanswered questions. Too many scenes were unnecessary and the entire lore of the Star Wars universe is replaced with something I cannot even explain. It lets you down, and keeps you down in the dumps from start to finish. Different writer, different story. Don't expect a Star Wars film, expect a Disney fantasy."
"839",5,"  Despite the negative attention garnered through Mark Hamill's quote being manipulated out of context, I believe anyone who is a fan of the original trilogy will have to acknowledge the love of the universe the creators of this film must have had and how it shows in every moment of this installment. This is a Star Wars fan's movie through and through."
"840",3,"  Some cool moments, no doubt a decent time for casual viewers, but too much good setup wasted for me to say I was satisfied. Most frustrating part of this movie was Laura Dem's character who irrationally created a bunch of conflict by keeping her plan to herself and letting Poe die inside at her decisions. Poe would have been on her side if she used a little communication, such a dumb plot point."
"841",3,"  This movie is decent on the surface until you notice that it really didn't continue any of the story from the force awakens. Audience left with more questions and no satisfying answers."
"842",0.5,"  The greatest troll film of all time. Every them, every plot thread, everything you thought you knew about Star Wars - TROLLED!If you were ever curious what it would look like if the emo/vegan kid who got teased by nerds made a Star Wars film looked like, this is the movie for you!"
"843",0.5,"  Wow, ABSOLUTELY horrible. no plot CONSISTENCY, horrible."
"844",0.5,"  Hey everyone, guess what? Disney's managed to destroy Star Wars!What's almost more disturbing is the realization that RT is just a place where Shitty movies get great reviews from ""critics"" who are more interested in praising leftist BS (in this case, strong, smart women vs. weak bumbling men) so prevalent in entertainment than admitting that for all intents and purposes, Hollywood Cinema is DEAD DEAD DEAD!Thanks Mickey!Good offing riddance!"
"845",4.5,"  Very underrated sure The Movie had Flaws but after I saw this it became my new 2nd Favorite Star Wars Movie. This Film had many gripes from Fans like the way they portrayed Luke and stuff like that but I still love the movie. Can't wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray."
"846",3.5,"  A sadly unpleasing sequel to Force Awakens. Almost painfully boring and to close to the prequels in terms of the useless humps of horrible obnoxious cgi characters. Not the worst star wars movie, and it wasn't THAT bad. I'd recommend it to any star wars fan."
"847",2,"  iN one sentence this is disappointment.Is this a bad movie? No. But it is not a good movie. As a Star Wars fun, I am disappointed. It has plot holes, misused characters, some of the worst comedy moments (not counting Jar Jar), butchers old characters at the expense of not known characters, puts two-dimensional women for sake of sticking them in, go against what we saw in previous movies (Star Wars lore), sticks ""sell-able"" toys left and right, and of course promotes lots of political agendas, which is such a shame, because some of the visuals are breathtaking, some of the concepts are interesting (albeit poorly executed), ships design, costumes, and creatures (minus Porgs) are great.But to put the question ""is this a bad movie?"" in perspective - I'd rather watch Episode 2."
"848",5,"  I pity you people who are STILL writing on this site on how much disdain you have for this film. I can understand it if you LOVE this amazing movie (pretty much the majority of the movie goers and fans) to continue talking about it. But to continue to dog is not only such a waste of time but so, so sad. 48% polled on this site did not like it...that's about 95 to 97, 000 out of 187,000. and if you dumbasses think that represents a majorty of fans and movie goers alike, you're simply paralyzed from teh neck up! LOL! Don't kid yours;eves, the movie rocked, it made it's money and then some...noone one person with a brain thought it was going to pull in TFA numbers so quit trying to justify your hatred by attempting to play number games of its success! And BTW, plot holes are not the equivalent to a plot you did not care for. An amazing plot with character development and growth by a first rate writer in Ryan Johnson! And if you're too stupid to recognize it, then you have no hope. For the rest of us , this film is a NEW HOPE in what this franchise needed to stay alive and relevant. Sorry you outspoken minority think you represent the whole...but you don't. Film rocks and looking forward to what's next!"
"849",4,"  This is not a perfect film by any means, it's filled with lots of problems, pointless subplots, bizarre character choices, and forced humor. But with all that said, for a 152 minute film, I was thoroughly entertained, was this what I expected? No but I definitely admire the film for making bold choices and taking risks that went against the usual Star Wars formula. I can definitely understand the hate this film has gotten from fans, but the stuff that's good is unbelievably good."
"850",3,"  I'll give the Last Jedi the benefit of the doubt and say it's a lot better the second time viewing. Although a lot of great films will make you want to rewatch it for the satisfaction of the first viewing, the second viewing of the Last Jedi is more of a way for viewers to try and get an answer from their confused first viewing, basically.But the second time through, the jokes seem more wholesome, moments are more captivating, and I'll be honest, the plot seemed to make some more sense. Sure it's a rough and long film, but having a lot of cliffhangers and unanswered questions is a good thing to set up Episode 9."
"851",3.5,"  Hey! Enough with the stylistic and silly dramatic ""surprises"" please. Just stick to Star Wars...or you'll shipwreck the institution."
"852",5,"  I loved this film so much! Rian did an outstanding job on the storyline."
"853",3,"  all over the place, just not where it's supposed to be"
"854",0.5,"  This episode is completeley disrespectful to Star Wars Saga. According to this, Luke is just a loser, And episodes IV, V and VI are all lies."
"855",0.5,"  Que horror de pelicula..."
"856",0.5,"  There's no possible rating I can give this movie that is sufficiently low enough. -10 million isn't enough to note just how bad this movie is and what a dump it takes on star wars as a whole. This movie killed star wars for me as a life long fan who saw the original back in the drive in movie theatre in the 70's."
"857",0.5,"  This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Plot holes everywhere, disjointed and contrived plot, horrible subplots, destroyed OT characters, ultimate Mary Sue, wasted character development. Just an awful movie outside of score and visuals. First star wars movie I didn't to see a second/third time in theaters, won't be purchasing on blu ray, and won't ever watch again. A disgrace in every possible sense."
"858",5,"  Best Star Wars movies since Empire Strikes Back and The Force Awakens!"
"859",4.5,"  I am amazed by the amount of hate this film received. I thought the action was great, the story was great (aside from the Casino planet scenes), and I feel this sets up an exciting and intriguing future for upcoming Star Wars movies."
"860",0.5,"  Critics loved this because of the countless ""virtu-signaling"" no doubt. Also a beautifully shot film with Star Wars-like scenes but it's all only surface deep. The more time I spend reflecting, the more disappointed I am. What a missed opportunity. I want to throat punch Rian Johnson!"
"861",5,"  I understand why people don't like it as much, but honestly. I liked it, right from the beginning. After watching it multiple times it only reinforces how great I think it is. Are there parts I don't like? Yes, of course (looking at you Canto Bight), but I think on the whole, the movie didn't play it safe. It gave Star Wars fans something new and interesting. I think the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship is one of the most compelling story arcs in the whole series. He was too powerful at too young an age and the adults in his life didn't know how to deal with him. He had no one in his corner. It's no wonder he was so easily manipulated by Snoke and the dark side. But now there's Rey in his life. She will be his guiding light. She also feels like no one was ever in her corner. And the person she thought was going to step into that role (Luke) didn't. Ben was there, and he did help her. She sees the good in him and wants so badly to save him. In the end, even though they fought together, She can't stay, he won't leave, but they're connected. I ardently believe neither of them can kill the other. They're 2 sides of the same coin. I want her to help redeem him so badly in 9. I want them to dissolve the first order together, but I'm afraid the 'redeemed Skywalker' trope is too tired. Please JJ Abrams, don't ruin this for me. I like Luke's arc, as well as Poe's. I thought they both really developed as characters. Initially I really disliked Finn's story, but after multiple viewings I changed my mind. Rose and DJ are like the angel and devil on Finn's shoulders. DJ was what Finn was; Focused on saving himself. Don't join, run away. But Rose is the opposite; duty, honor, courage. He struggles throughout the movie with both sides of himself, but Rose and the resistance win him over. I'm hoping in the next movie he'll be less selfish. I don't know where they're going to take his character. Over all I thought it was a fantastic addition to the series. It wasn't perfect, but I liked that it wasn't cookie cutter. I am so excited to see what JJ Abrams brings us for 9!"
"862",0.5,"  Not what it was. So lame, poor story. Disthrone EP 1 by far!"
"863",5,"  Cinematically beautiful and I love the depth they are adding to both sides of the conflict. Shades of grey rather than black and white. Can't wait for Episode IX."
"864",5,"  A very surprising turn for the franchise, and a very divisive one, nonetheless, Star Wars: the Last Jedi does its best to break free of the shadow of the original trilogy and become its own thing, and it does so successfully. While many may mourn the way the original characters are sidelined in favor of this new generation, there is no denying that Star Wars is treading new waters here, and supplying fans with many new twists and turns, along with more layered storytelling and fleshed out characters."
"865",5,"  I loved this movie. The characters were more fully fleshed out, the story was exciting, and most importantly, it furthered and deepened the plot of this modern trilogy. Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren, and Daisy Ridley as Rey, were both so well done, completely immersing each character with the struggles of finding his/her place in the force, and from adolescence into adulthood. The throne room scene was hands down the best light-saber fight sequence in all of Star Wars. The music was absolutely wonderful, punctuating the ebb and flow of the storyline in the masterful way Williams has done with every Star Wars movie. Most importantly, what TFA & TLJ accomplish and is so needed in Hollywood, is representation! Heroes that are women, people of color, and perhaps even of different orientations, are so important to see on the big screen. And these heroes and villains are absolutely relatable to all of us, no matter our background. This is why I hold this movie up there with one of my absolute favorite recent movies, along with Black Panther. The latter a whole other review of superb performances and characters that appeal to all generations and backgrounds. I'm shocked by it's low audience score, especially rating this below the Prequels, which were unwatchable and horrible to sit through in the theaters. TLJ will one day be looked at as the perfect bridge between TFA and #9. I will agree that I am not such a fan of the Canto Bight sequence, outside of the character development opportunities it gave Finn, Rose & DJ. It did seem excessively long. And yes, it was hard to see Luke's portrayal as less of a guide and more of an angry and forgotten hero - yet what a commentary on how we treat elders in our society. And what a journey his character traverses throughout TLJ, confronting his own demons and internalizing the importance of embracing failure. Watching the extras, including Rian Johnson's documentary ""Director & the Jedi"" as well as his additional commentary, helped me fuse all the pieces to understand his vision for this movie, and how it fits into the big picture of these characters' respective heroes journeys.I can't wait until the next movie, and have high hopes that JJ Abrams will tie up the series in a thoughtful, edge-of-our-seat, fantastic way that the Original Trilogy did for us so long ago. I am a big fan of the entire Original Trilogy, Star Wars Rebels & Forces of Destiny. Was not a fan of the Prequels or Rogue One (despite liking Jyn Erso)."
"866",5,"  Best Star Wars movie ever made!"
"867",4,"  So what i like this last jedi because i like Rey actions or New Planet or New Spaceship and also like beautiful Carrie fisher made final film before she pass away"
"868",0.5,"  The film was terrible. luke Skywalker was turned into a grumpy coward Rey has no sense of progression she just picks up a lightsaber and within 2 seconds beats luke Skywalker and kylo. The whole film was a political statement and a absolutely terrible film"
"869",1,"  Non-consistent with anything Star Wars. It should have been named ""Guardians of the galaxy 3"". Then it would have made more sense. The Last Jedi is a complete travesty, and for me, the title is prophetic. It means it's the last ever Jedi movie I'll ever pay to see in a theatre. Good job, Disney. I hope you got a good bunch of 7-10 years old kids to replace the millions of fans you just shit on. Boycott them, it's all the power you have, now, my fellow betrayed force believer friends. So sad..."
"870",2,"  Honestly very entertaining, but relied too heavily on ""witty"" one-liners and critters to capture the attention of the younger crowd as well as those who played with furby as a kid. And don't even get me started on the character Rose. I'm all about women empowerment but there was absolutely no reason Po couldn't have gone with Finn. Not only is the lead character a female (again I don't have a problem with this) but also saturated this film with females taking the lead on something because men are "" power-hungry misogynistic pigs."" So in an attempt to eradicate sexism, the film just welcomes it as long as a woman is speaking up. Also the love story between Rose and Finn felt rushed and unnecessary. I'm just saying, if Finn dies in that scene saving people, the movie would have been way better. However the fight and battle scenes were enjoyable and entertaining, but not enough to cover the lack of quality character development."
"871",0.5,"  I started an account just to say this about the last Jedi. If you want to see a movie that a SJW, a Chinese communist propagandist and a feminist get together to make a movie and the only thing that resembles Star Wars is the title go see this movie you will love it. It shows men being submissive bitches and complete losers it will suck out every ounce of soul and hope out of the audience. It's almost like they just wantth a movie to shot on men and Star Wars and they totally accomplished that. We need to teach Disney a lesson I am boycotting all their games EA games battlefront 2 and merchandise as well the next movie I will wait till I hear reviews before I go see it all my friends agree China basically insulted Americans. I give Star Wars the last Jedi tge worst movie ever made."
"872",2,"  Entertaining, but full of plot holes, and stark departures to the known Star Wars characters. visually pleasing, emotionally dissatisfying."
"873",5,"  I really liked the film. It was exciting, creative and had a couple of surprises. The acting was great. The music was very moving and classical star wars."
"874",3.5,"  I would have to be 10 years old as a young boy so excited about the Star Wars universe, to watch Star Wars for the first time where technology has that fashion and style that isn't the 70's or 80's old school sense of humor, this being 2010s where evil becomes more like breaking the ice, becoming angry is the new style instead of smiling and being a polite stereotype - be angry, swear if you have to we aint first-time strangers unless I suffer memory loss not knowing who you are kind of we aint perfect but we move forward to be polite in public places like school or workplace. Being middle aged at 54, I can see employment of all kinds in this movie- people need to work to survive without losing their marbles and doing time in the mental hospital or prison. Still it's better than watching Netflix movie or TV show that doesn't have many people employed in the film indistry /*\;,."

"876",0.5,"  Worst part of the saga, spitting in the face of what we saw and loved in the last 40 years of SW. Force Disney to strike this piece of bantha poodoo out off the official SW saga!!!"
"877",1,"  The Last Jedi is a bait and switch.Subversion: ""the tendency or intention to subvert or overthrow, destroy, or undermine an established or existing system or a set of beliefs.""Bait and switch: ""the ploy of offering a person something desirable to gain favor, and then thwarting expectations with something less desirable.""Subverting expectations, Rian? Isn't that what you did? With pride, I may add.The same expectations you created with the trailers? Isn't that bait and switch?BAIT AND SWITCH IS ILLEGAL IN THE USA!!!!What about starting a Class Action against Disney? We ALL should sue Disney and get our money back."
"878",0.5,"  This is the worst star wars film ever produced, possibly the worst film ever made. It is superficial where it attempts depth, it is clumsy when it attempts to be sober. It has no story to speak of, and where it is even coherent one might well wish it were not. You can see the mistakes coming a mile off, and just have to sit there saying, 'don't do it'. But, in the end, you just know they're going to do it."
"879",1,"  Full of sjw propaganda"
"880",5,"  One of the best mid-trilogy movies I have ever seen. Rian created a world that could lead to endless possibilities in episode IX. I would highly recommend watching it more than once to recognize and appreciate the subtle direction the film pulls you in: especially the story line with Poe. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver give amazing performances, and while John Boyega was given the weakest story line he shines through. While Daisy Ridley's character was played well, manic changes in disposition and intents can leave you feeling like you've experienced whip lash (I'm looking to you salt flat scenes). How well this movie stands the test of time will be determined by how episode IX goes. If JJ doesn't tightly weave a storyline off of this one and replicates an already used story line (return of the jedi) the work Rian did to shift the universe storyline will have been useless. If something interesting can be done that directly ties into this movie then I can see the Last Jedi going down as one of the best star wars films to ever be made. Given how the Force Awakens was written I'm skeptical that JJ will be able to take Rian's vision to this conclusion, and so I'm weary of how well the last jedi will age in the franchise. Old male rights activists will never like it, but they are not the ones who will be re-watching this movie in 20-30 years. I hope JJ writes a script that can capture that depth that was presented and deliver a home run."
"881",0.5,"  The people who wrote this have no relation to Starwars, they have never been fans, they have never liked sci fi, they have no passion... If you wanted to sabotage a franchise, you would hire these people, its a terrible movie, shame on Disney."
"882",3,"  The Last Jedi's Visually spectacular frames, composition and expertly handled special effects attempt to to make up for some questionable decisions within its narrative and is successful to some extent. Just as ""The Force Awakens"" suffered from recycled plot lines from ""A New Hope"", The Last Jedi Recycles some aspects from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" but also introduces new ideas and a interesting new exploration of the force that may not sit right with many of the beloved franchises dedicated fans. The fresh ideas that the film introduced did overall deliver a very enjoyable and visually stunning experience from its spectacular motion capture of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, to its eye popping space and light saber battle. The film dose boast some flaws such as a strange and unjustified character arc for one of the supporting characters as well as a side plot that takes us to a new planet full of corrupt wealthy characters that feels very unnecessary and almost breaks us away from the established world of the film and nearly becoming dispensable. Nonetheless the Last Jedi is a much more enjoyable experience than it's predecessor and adds to the mythology and vibrant world of Star Wars as an Effective second entry to the new Trilogy."
"883",0.5,"  I liked it, but the pacing was odd and some scenes could have been cut ( the milk scene) for better moments i.e they cut a scene of b88 showing finn a recording of rey saying goodbye to him like that would have added more feeling to the movie. The humor throws off the serious moments and they could have used john boyega and oscar issaac in much better ways. I thought the movie was very grim and not kid like at all. I think a better editor could have fixed 80% of what I don't like about this movie."
"884",1,"  The Last Jedi is so disappointing on many levels. Rian Johnson is a good filmmaker and the film is technically marvelous. But this could've been the Star Wars film we've always wanted. Instead we see one of the most beloved and iconic characters in cinema get reduced to a coward. They should have called this film Episode 8: Luke Never Leaves the Island. I was also annoyed with being beat over the head with an over the top feminist agenda. EVERY leader in the resistance is a woman... even the squad leader! Every male character is a testosterone filled idiot, a coward, or a leader in the First Order. I love strong capable female characters... but this film does not portray equality. Too long. Stupid jokes. Lame subplots. But most of all... Luke Skywalker goes out like a little bitch. Thank you, Rian. This was a huge wasted opportunity."
"885",0.5,"  Luke Skywalker can find the good in the most evil being in cinema history, but not his thirteen year old nephew who thought about the dark side. That was NO ONES Luke Skywalker and his character arch was ruined. Very disappointed."
"886",0.5,"  Star Wars is over. Please, just let it be done. The new franchise is full of completely unlikeable characters."
"887",5,"  So far, the best of the Sequel Trilogy."
"888",3,"  I'm giving this very strong three stars because it was a good movie but not nearly as great as the Force Awakens. I don't understand why so many people are negating the Force Awakens. It brought back Start Wars in a way that George Lucas could never do. I grew up watching the first original trilogy. The prequels were difficult to stomach. I think that Last Jedi is nowhere near as bad as the prequels. I just didn't like the scene where Leia used the force in space. That scene was crap. The Yoda was scene was cool but Yoda looked odd. The entire Rose and Fin scene was terrible. I did like the beginning of the movie and fight sequences. Overall not the greatest movie but it was okay. I'm not sure if I'll buy it."
"889",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars movie ever. It was grear to see Mark Hamill again. What they did to Luke Skywalker is a disgrace. I could write an essay about how bad this movie is. No heart and No soul."
"890",0.5,"  These sequels make the prequels look good. the Star Wars franchise has become a SOULLESS political crap pot."
"891",0.5,"  This is simply propaganda with ""Star Wars"" in the title."
"892",0.5,"  My honest belief is that this film ranks the worst star wars film so far. And I increasingly believe that the critics who scored highly of this movie is being paid to make the rating so high. Shame on them all for being a dishonest bunch. The film doesn't make any logical sense and it feels that it is disjoined from the Force Awakens. Killing Luke in this films tell most of the audience who grows up with it ""FUCK YOU"". Old people has no place in the star wars. If you are old, you die is basically what this film is about. I am not even getting on the perspective of that ridiculous purple vice admiral. The way she executes a plan is trying to enforce the concept women are ridiculous in decision making or something else entirely, I don't know. What I do know is the plot is stupid, not logical, ill thought out. The way to fix it could be saying that she thought theres a spy on board and hence she had to keep all plans to herself but we didn't see that writing anywhere. So what actually went on that purple head, absolutely no idea. Anyway, Snoke was kind of stupid. He didn't learn from history or from himself. When you got old, you got killed by your apprentice. It might be a sith tradition but should he actually guard against this Ben Solo? And Snoke probably was the only Sith Lord who never wielded a lightsaber. Whats going on there? We had never seen the weapons he used either. There you go, such rotten stupid movies."
"893",2.5,"  Agenda driven filmmaking at its worst. Hurts my heart."
"894",0.5,"  Left handed and sucks."
"895",3.5,"  Better than some of the others not as good as a couple."
"896",1,"  Worst Star Wars Movie ever"
"897",0.5,"  This movie was designed to destroy all previous Star Wars canon (including the Force Awakens), and in that it has succeed spectacularly. Anyone who doubts my claim can look at the choices made in the movie. Favorite characters dying, important plot points from the previous film leading nowhere, plot holes everywhere, an idiot in charge of the Resistance after Leia is rendered comatose (Leia's force flight being the least egregious sin of this movie), and so many other things wrong. Were this country ruled by Star Wars fans (of which I am not really), Rian Johnson would be publicly caned for the crime of ruining Star Wars. I would say I'm surprised by the movie's high rating, but I'm not. Plenty of critics don't know their heads from their rumps when it comes to a good movie, and plenty of others are afraid to give the film a low review in case the Disney hit squad sues them into oblivion. All in all, worse than actual torture. If your torturer threatens you with this movie, give them what they want immediately."
"898",5,"  As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise, because (spoiler alert): It is!If you haven't seen the previous installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, then I highly recommend you grab some friends to watch it with and get yourself back on track. Otherwise, you will be in for a big surprise. For those who have seen it, then you know that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) makes an iconic return to the big screen and this time, with a vengeance. Luke went into hiding, undetected, to the Porg-infested island of Ahch-To to die. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has a mission to bring Luke back to fight the Resistance as war is once again brewing against the First Order. Millions of porg-encounters later, Rey finally persuades Luke to lend her his knowledge in combat, leaving Luke unsettled by the strength of her powers.This time around, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) leads the Resistance due to unforeseen circumstances. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Holdo go head to head as he refuses to follow Holdo's rules. This creates major conflict in the storyline, as some things don't necessarily go as planned during combat. We are also introduced to a new lead character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker that guards the escape pods. She bonds with Finn (John Boyega) as she takes him to her wealthy home of Canto Bight. Though, there's so much more to this planet than meets the eye.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains high and mighty, just for show. It's evident that he hides something deep within, something he cannot control - a slight hint of compassion. After a head-to-head conflict with Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), the film finally reveals who he truly is.Now that you have an idea of what the film is about, let's talk about the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes. To be quite honest, the writing has its lows. There are moments when the audience would let out an uncomfortable laugh due to the awkward, juvenile jokes that we know certain characters would never say or do. It felt somewhat out-of-touch with the Star Wars franchise, especially since they are thrown in during the most serious, suspenseful scenes. Despite that, the rest of the screenplay is groundbreaking. It gives the audience what they want and what they didn't know they needed. Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. Shooting in locations such as Ireland and Croatia, the visual effects team make it seem as though they are off in a galaxy far, far away, without straying from its natural beauty. Special effects, as always, are mind-blowing. It's nearly impossible not to fathom lightsabers being real. Top it all off with detailed costume design and award-winning acting, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.Ultimately, Star Wars: The Last Jedi exceeded far beyond my expectations, and I urge you to go out with your Jedi Knight robes and lightsabers and experience it on the big screen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 as well as adults. It opens December 15, 2017 in U.S. theaters so, go check it out. reviewed by michelle c., kids first! fILM CRITIC. fOR MORE REVIEWS BY YOUTH, VISIT KIDSFIRST DOT ORG."
"899",5,"  I'm surprised to see how divided people are on this movie. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and really enjoyed it. The more I watch it the more I enjoy it. I have a feeling that this movie will be reviewed more positively in the eyes of it audience as time goes by and people realize that the characters and plot went in a different direction to what they had imagined and that this was okay to happen."
"900",2,"  This movie was tiresome and disappointing."
"901",1,"  ""This is not the Star Wars movie you're looking for."""
"902",1,"  Such a garbage movie. Childhood killed because of how bad they made this crap."
"903",4.5,"  An amazing and innovative update on a beloved series."
"904",2,"  It Just could of been better. really need to go back and remake the 7th. the CGI, HOW IT WAS FILM WAS NICE BUT THE STORY WAS JUST SAD. JUST DON'T LIKE IT AND WISH THEY WROTE IT BETTER. OR JUST KEPT THE eu WHICH IN MY OPINION HAS MUCH MORE DEPTH AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Even Mark Hamill did not like the script. Wonder if its to late to go back to the EU"
"905",5,"  Everything about this movie was not what I expected at all. Was blown away by the plot and I am really glad I saw it."
"906",0.5,"  A real going down for the franchise...and Finn is becoming the New Jar-Jar Binks...#Yawn"
"907",0.5,"  A total waste, a betrayal to the star wars spirit...thank you georges for selling star wars soul to the greedy dumb devils from disney."
"908",2,"  Fun movie. Significant logic flaws. Biggest problem: the movie is a long commercial of toys yet to come. The length of the movie and the characters (or participants) in the movie are often there for commercial purposes. Disney still doesn't know how to make an adult movie, and they want to make their money back on the purchase from Lucas ASAP."
"909",4,"  Saw the film twice. 4/5 . No, it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie to me, but then neither did The Force Awakens. I enjoyed and respect this film much more for its storytelling boldness, strangeness, and what was, to me, a thrilling cinematic experience."
"910",5,"  Last Jedi is an amazing movie. Some of the dumbest arguments I've heard in my entire life have been about this movies failures... there isn't many. The hat this movie received astounds me."
"911",1.5,"  This has to be the worst Star wars movie . First of all it seems like everyone who worked on the film is not familiar or has not taken the time to really appreciate what star wars is all about . The movie has massive plot holes and doesn't seem to know where the saga left off in the last film , I mean how does the first order get so massive after just being decimated by the republic ? And how does the republic not help Lea and her group , they clearly had communication with the out side world . There is a lot of things that are wrong but godamnit why did you make Luke so unLuke like , Luke the guy who found good in the most evil villain in the star wars franchise tries to kill his nephew like WTF . I hate you Disney and Rian , you have alieneted the fans that supported the franchise all this while and for what ? , Branch diverse , feminine and progressive ? You have killed Star wars , I just hoped you wouldn't spoil Luke for us like you did Han Solo."
"912",0.5,"  Too many logic problems and doesn't have the same spirit of the rest of the movies."
"913",0.5,"  Hard to believe a movie this bad can get made. It jumps about randomly. The behaviour of the characters is completely incomprehensible. I'm not even sure who the main character is."
"914",1,"  What... was this movie about? What were the themes? What was the character progression? Why is the most beloved Star Wars character of all time turned into a coward? Why is he afraid of this emo kid? Who thought that completely destroying all of our favorite characters and attempting the replace them with vapid and undeveloped paper dolls? It looked pretty. I thought the sound was great. This is the first piece of Star Wars I will not spend another dime on. Do you hear me Disney? This is not how you get my money."
"915",2,"  Very bad iteration of once great franchise. It is inconsistent towards predecessors including The Force Awakens. I had very bad experience as a fan of the Star Wars and moviegoer."
"916",1,"  Where they went with Luke's story was the biggest slap in the face for Star Wars fans, plot hole after plot hole, jokes were stupid and took all the feeling and seriousness out of the movie. A whole lot more."
"917",0.5,"  Worst Star Wars film ever a.huge dissapointment.I use to believe it couldnt get.worse than Jar Jar Binks until TLJ proved differently."
"918",0.5,"  It should be completely scrapped.This movie failed miserably on its purpose.The actors had no fault on this massive failure.Bad script.Terrible story.With so many already stories ready on the Star Wars universe I wonder who is wasting money destroying this franchise by investing in such shallow scripting."
"919",0.5,"  Absolute trash city. the title of the movie should be called ""Star wars: trash city"". apparently the entire history of the canon means absolutely nothing now, and Disney has decided to ad lib the entire thing. First of all, apparently Leia is now sorceress. After three movies (four if you count her as a baby in Ep. III), several books, and many comics leia has shown zero force sensitivity, let alone the ability to survive long exposure to the vacuum of space before flyng to the safety of a distant air-lock. I mean come on! Leia literally is flyng through f****** space for the love of God. Luke turned from the hopeful hero in the original series to lazy, pussified, whiny man who draws his lightsaber on his nephew (ready to strike) without a work because I believes that Kylo Ren may be too far gone to the dark side. This is the same guy who literally, literally had his hand cut off by his estranged father and refused to kill him when he was in a fit of rage (Ep. 3). now you expect me believe this Bulls*** from Disney that he, while calm and collected, was ready to kill his nephew (whom he loved) on a whim? Once again Disney, wtf is going on? The question I really want to ask is how many blow jobs Disney had to dish out to the critics so that they would give their movie a 91%. Additionally, I think that rey is dope af. she is the baddest b**** ini all of star wars (in my opinion). But what this about having zero training and being able to lift 10 metric tons of boulders out of the way for her and her pals? I know what you're thinking; ""but wait! in this movie she trained with Luke, a jedi master"". you would correct. But to put this into context, Anakin trained from a young boy up until he turned on the jedi council to be able to do similar feats with the force. If you think that it's accurate to have rey doing that s*** after a couple days of breathing exercises you need a psychological evaluation. Another point! in ep. III yoda (I think we can all agree that he is a powerful jedi) was spinning those weird disks and throwing them at palpatine with difficulty. I'm not buying this Bs. And yoda in this movie? name any! any! literally any point throughout star wars that a force ghost physically interacted with their surrounding in the way that yoda does in this movie. yeah. you can't. If yoda can light s*** on fire why didn't he just go kill snoke himself or at least help his homies out at the end battle of this movie. Now lets talk about snoke. a sith lord so powerful that he can take someone as strong as rey and literally over power her with one hand while delivering his evil monologue. Which I would have accepted had they given even a glimpse of his abilities or his origin. Darth sideous is lucky af that snoke was just lurking in the background while he was ruling, because snoke who have made him his little b**** boy. And what is wrong with the social justice warrior bs that decided to throw in with rose? ""now it was worth it"". Excuse me, what? everyone you know and love is about to be murdered by the first order and you're taking your time to smash a casino and then take even more time to free some horse-like animal. wow. Disney is preying on people taken up by the left-wing political ideas and those are nostalgic for some old school star wars details. From now on, I will only refer to this movie as Star wars: trash city."
"920",1,"  This movie was a travesty to Star Wars movies. I sold all my other memorabilia and will never spend another dime on Disney star wars GARBAGE."
"921",1,"  A movie that made me left the theater bored, insulted, confused and hopeless. This is by far the worst Star Wars movie, and one of the worst movies period. While the prequels weren't masterpieces, they were at least fun and imaginative. The makers of this movie, since i can't believe they are that inept at moviemaking, apparently must have went out of their way to make this movie as unfun and repulsive as possible. I won't go into detail in this review, because i would basically have to comment on every single scene of the movie, from the toilet level ""comedy"" gag in the opening, to the laughable broom kid ending. It was a mess from start to finish, and I'm done with Disney's Star Wars, they have no vision for the series, or even an idea what they're doing. I won't see episode 9, i won't see Solo, and i sure as heck won't see rian's next trilogy. Star Wars ended with return of the jedi, and let's leave it at that."
"922",0.5,"  I think the clips are enough (from the trailer, best scenes, etc.) to tell anyone, that this is NOT Wars and that is definitely NOT the Luke we know. Really sad."
"923",1,"  TOXIC FEMINISM, S.J.W. and ROSE, the OXYMORON who saves the animals for one day but NOT the children?.... STAR WARS is destroyed by the EVIL EMPIRE of left wing, pink, communist, social Marxist fascism! You may have won the battle, Kathleen Kreepy Kennedy (K.K.K.)....... But you will NEVER win the war against GOD, FAMILY, FAITH and LOVE!"
"924",1,"  Han Solo is resting peacefully in his grave not having to be involved in this SJW train wreck"
"925",0.5,"  The Last Jedi is the absolute worst Star Wars movie in the saga. Don't be fooled. There is no way this movie is 91% fresh, that would be like critics saying ""Batman & Robin"" is a far superior film to ""The Dark Knight"" The Last Jedi is a movie basically made out of greed. Any reality or common sense in this film is completely out the window. This movie is a horrible mess filled with plot holes, rehashed ideas, WTF moments and dumb decisions. Disney has decided to push their politics (while milking any last remaining cash from original Star Wars fans) instead of telling a good story that makes any sense within the entire Star Wars saga. The humor in the film falls extremely flat. Most of the jokes with Rey and Luke are just so brutal to watch. I feel for Mark Hamill in this one, because you can tell he hated being in this stupid film. The stupid cheesy lines of dialog in the film are as bad as any in the Star Wars prequels. Luke comments on Leia's hair? Luke and Leia (two character icons) and haven't appeared together on screen since 1983, and that's all he has to say??? The saddest thing about The Last Jedi is the total lack of respect and judgement that Disney and Rian Johnson has shown to everything that was created before it. Watching this movie is like watching beloved old friends being marched into Disney death camps. But Disney will still show Chewbacca, C3PO or Yoda for a second or two just to remind you you might be watching a Star Wars movie. This was Disney's FU to original Star Wars fans. The Star Wars magic is gone and it isn't coming back."
"926",1,"  The worst thing since Hitler."
"927",1,"  Terrible........I want a good story that also doesnt betray the first 6 films. This is perverted with modern day views and politics. The very same reason i cant watch star trek discovery. Spoon fed SJW content instead of making a great star wars. Hands down. the worst star wars yet"
"928",0.5,"  Movie was complete Trash. The tomatometer is shit, this website is liberalized trash. (not talking to politics) Introducing Holdo and giving her a roll we could have easily given akbar. The mary sue. Underutilized look, this is literally hte worst movie i've ever seen."
"929",0.5,"  This film breaks virtually every rule in storytelling to politicise some silly notions about societal reform and methodically sets about destroying the very canon which it tried to use as a springboard for their ideology. I never thought that ""I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating.."" Could be made to look like compelling writing but here we are. I was upset about what was done to Star Trek, but this is a much higher level in perversion of canon."
"930",2,"  How to ruin well established characters, old and new. Wasted potential and questionable story with many plot holes. Still a fun action movie but one of the weakest star wars."
"931",0.5,"  The movie lacked consistency and the characters were occ. The plot made no sense and it looked like a Reylo fanfiction. It was a big disappointment"
"932",0.5,"  Absolute steamy pile and a disgrace to any true star wars fan"
"933",0.5,"  Edited review. Sorry, for some reason everything is coming in caps??? sorry!!Firstly, to the guy who keeps saying make it one star or more... If it was going to make a difference that 48% would have moved by now. Frankly, the RT % is falsified, it is not a real number. Which says all sorts of things about the authenticity of this site. Simply put: Shame on you RT.This foolishly made film was more a transparent join the dots political manifesto than a coherent story. while one can understand someone with a political agenda making a pitch to 'sell' the feminist / anti capitalist concept, the fact that it was green lighted, and then the fact that it was accomplished so ham-fistedly really makes you wonder about those with decision-making responsibility at disney.I am one that thinks TFA set up the rest of a trilogy on a shaky footing (why make han and leia estranged, for example / why kill han / why make another giant space gun / why cast an emo as a villain). Be that as it may, rian johnson ruined any chance f this trilogy having any kind of satisfactory pay off. iconic characters were disposed of at a whim, new and stupid laws of the force were introduced, and what could have been a subtle addressing of diversity and gender equality in the SW universe were handled in a laughably embarrassing manner. it fells like it was written by an angst-ridden 18 year old gender-studies student with a chip on their shoulder.Oh, and when circumstances dictated that we had the perfect way to farewell poor carrie, that can was just kicked down the road.Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself and if he was railroaded into making a political statement by kennedy, then he needs to grow a paid and defend himself.I am ashamed of everyone involved in this movie with the exception of mark hamill. Good on him for calling out the absurd story and then being a pro and going through with it."
"934",1.5,"  El peor error en la vida es vender los derechos de autor a Disney. Un fiasco total, deprimente, aburrida, sobreactuada."
"935",1,"  Spaceballs 2 the death of a franchise. This movie is a utter disgrace. Disney you are a disgrace. Tomatoes you are at it. 48 % for a month now come on? Johnson you are a complete clown. If you thought this was bad check out the deleted scenes on YouTube. Scottish dance music in a star wars film? You're a plumb. Storm troopers with deep southern us accents arse slapping. Is this guy got mental attributes of a 10 year old? Congratulations all the best franchises are butchered. Aliens, predator, terminator and now Star Wars. This guy is gonna direct the next trilogy. You haven't told me anything in the last 2 movies. You should be giving people their money back it's false advertising it's not a Star Wars movie you hacks"
"936",2.5,"  I hate that Luke becomes a grumpy old man and dies at the end he is the chosen one for Pete's sake! I hated the hole casino scene, rose seemed very thrust into it all, and they could have done so much more with Snoke!all in all, it does not compare to Rouge One."
"937",4,"  I don't understand why this movie got so many bad reviews. It is a good sequel to a wonderful series. It's not going to be some cult classic, but as a star wars film it passes the torch to rey and kylo just fine."
"938",0.5,"  A disgrace to all star wars fans"
"939",0.5,"  One of the most disappointing experiences I have had in a long time, and by far the worst one in the Star Wars universe. Visually, it was pretty, and well designed, except for the moronic bombers and ""speeders"" They simply make zero sense in a sci fi context. The tempo was completely off, right from the very beginning when the first order is portrayed as buffons rather than establishing credibility as the ""big bad"" This destroyed immersion for me right from the getgo, and the incoherent scripting was never able to regain suspension of disbelief. Jokes are fine and great, but should be used to break continued, high levels of tension, here, they opened with jokes that failed to land, and never managed to establish tension. The story ""progressed"" with leaders scapegoating in order to emasculate Poe, and show ""powerful"" characters by tearing other characters down to show their superior value. All this comes free, with a plot so disturbingly full of holes it appears to be a paper researched and written the night before it was due. This plot disrespects physics, and especially logical thought and intelligent tactics so much that it was not possible for me to get into the film.Suspension of disbelief is critical for getting moviegoers to overlook or forgive technical oversights.. but film never came close to establishing enough credibility, and has a HUGE number of logic failures that require forgiving. Overall.. it was pretty.. but the writing was horrific, and kept delivering one insult after another. The story was never gripping, tense, nor entertaining, leaving my most frequent thought during the film as ""are you f*$#@ng kidding me?"""
"940",0.5,"  This film ruined Star Wars for me. I have been a Fan for almost 20 years, loved the movies, the books and video games... HATE The Last Jedi. The Sequel Trilogy has nothing better to do than to burry all of your Childhood Heroes because ""the young audience wants to see the older generation pass the torch to a younger generation""... really? This film is worse than Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace combined."
